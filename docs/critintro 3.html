<h1>Critical AI &amp; creative–critical coding need each other</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m stuck here inputting and outputting the data of a story I can’t
change.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>–Italo Calvino “The Burning of the Abominable House” <span
class="citation"

</blockquote>
<p>💜 <span class="newthought"><em>Trans*formative TechnoCraft</em>
argues for the essential entanglement</span> of critical AI approaches
and creative-critical coding communities, showing how each is predicated
on the other. No intervention in disproportionately harmful algorithmic
systems is possible without critically aware approaches to technologies
from deeply plural perspectives. No such proliferation of perspectives
is possible without inviting spaces to understand, interrogate, and
reimagine the infrastructures that support those systems. Many other
works have confirmed that [critical AI interventions (or creative
coding) are necessary]. This work shows what entanglements of
intersectional, interdisciplinary, creative–critical approaches to the
urgent problems of [emergent technologies] can look like. Its collection
of texts apply these approaches as in-practice experiments — in
different contexts, for different audiences, for different aspects of
the issues, which must be addressed [through multimodal and polyvocal
means].</p>
<p>The stakes are high: technologies like machine learning urgently
require transformative interventions that recalibrate their values and
[stakeholders]. The communities most impacted by them, and best poised
to intervene, go unheard as powerful actors profit from their data and
labor exploitation. These companies warn of hyperbolic coming dangers in
order to distract from the current dangers they perpetuate.
Already-toothless policy recommendations are quickly watered down and
ignored. Meanwhile more and more data represent less and less diversity,
more and more processing power destroys more and more planet. [What is
treated as glib fun on one side of the globe is pennies a day and life
or death on the other.] But why must it be this way?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must begin with the knowledge that new technologies will not
simply redistribute power equitably within already established
hierarchies of difference. The idea that they will is the stuff of
utopian naivete and technological determinism that got us here to begin
with.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<!-- When Ted Nelson, creator of hypertext, said in 1970 that "computerization can take whatever form we wish it to; therefore we must learn about computers in order to wish better" [@SoftwareInformationTechnology1970], it was still the era of the early internet's false promises of free, democratic, anonymous spaces.  -->
<!-- Without critical engagement, techno-optimism replicates the [XXX].  -->
<p>We cannot expect technology to solve the problems of technology. But
we can reclaim [technology as a human craft.] With critical engagement,
we can work to return more access, investment, and community agency to
technology by viewing it through different lenses. We can transform
technologies themselves rather than accepting their current shapes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Anyone who has ever woven or knitted knows that one can change
patterns […] but, more importantly, they know <em>there are other
patterns</em>. The web of technology can indeed be woven differently,
but even to discuss such intentional changes of pattern requires an
examination of the features of the current pattern and an understanding
of the origins and the purpose of the present design.”

</blockquote>
<p>Yet, how do we participate on our own terms, in order to change
systems to suit us? Especially when learning programming and engaging
with tech is often so intimidating? How do we keep from further
marginalizing those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to
face the challenges of emerging technologies and to change them?</p>
<section id="critical-ai-must-be-intersectional" class="level2">
<h2>Critical AI must be intersectional</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Questions like ‘is a computer creative’ or ‘is a computer an artist’
or the like should not be considered serious questions, period. In the
light of the problems we are facing at the end of the 20th century,
those are irrelevant questions. Computers can and should be used in art
in order to draw attention to new circumstances and connections and to
forget ‘art’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>–Frieder Nake, “There Should Be No Computer Art” <span
class="citation" data-cites="nakeThereShouldBe1971">(1971)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions about art, creativity, and labor in relation to AI are
fundamentally questions trying to define humanity — <em>What makes us
creative or empathetic? What makes us different from machines? What
makes us human?</em> They are old, old questions. They also emerge from
centuries of colonialized framings of ‘man’ as an idealized,
individualized white western subject. Hyped AI discourse explores
limited questions about AI because it continues to draw from limited
perspectives, letting status quo narratives about humans and automated
systems frame the terms of debate. “Machine learning […] is an
expression of that which has already been categorized,” says digital
culture researcher Ramon Amaro<span class="citation"
data-cites="amaroBlackTechnicalObject2022">(2022)</span>. Not to think
to train on a variety of faces, or not to raise concerns about training
on faces at all, happens because there is not a variety of perspectives
in the room when these very human decisions are being made — before,
during, and after the data is being collected; and before, during, and
after the code is being written and run.</p>
<p>Automated decision-making systems disproportionately harm the
marginalized majority. We are subject to these systems whenever we lend
our data by clicking terms of service pop-ups to make them go away; and
whenever we must be recognized by borders, banks, and bureaucracies of
any kind. Our varying degrees of vulnerability in these moments are
exploited and profited on — from testing biometric facial technologies
in refugee camps <span class="citation"
data-cites="neddenBiometrieGetestetMillionen2017">(Nedden and Dongus
2017)</span> to reinforcement learning reliant on chatbot user responses
and content moderation. Much amazing research has highlighted the
increasing impacts of AI systems and surveillance capitalism <span

Gebru 2021; Noble 2018)</span>.</p>
<p>[Yet] AI hype describes machine learning systems as impenetrable
black boxes. Black box thinking permeates the interfaces with which we
engage its tools; it claims the proprietary restrictions that hide its
data (our data); and it influences the regulations that keep its power
in the hands of a select few. We only break out of those boxes when we
refuse to engage on those terms. “Artificial intelligence uses
classification to encode power,” says critical AI researcher Kate
Crawford. She argues that computational “ways of seeing depend on the
twin moves of abstraction and extraction. But these logics can be
challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="crawfordAtlasAIPower2021">(2021)</span>. The task of
critical AI researchers and makers is to engage these systems as
sociotechncial objects embedded in their historical, social, context,
argue [XXX-ID] Rita Raley and Jennifer Rhee. We must be “situated in
proximity to the thing itself, cultivating some degree of participatory
and embodied expertise, whether archival, ethnographic, or applied.

<p>This requires interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives. It
also requires what rhetorician Adam Banks calls “transformative access.”
He argues that access is more than owning or using tools, participating
in processes or even critiquing their failings. Transformative access is
“always an attempt to <em>both</em> change the interfaces [where people
use that system] and fundamentally change the codes that determine how
that system works.” Banks highlights the important role Black people
play in technology’s transformations, saying, “Black people have hacked
or jacked access to <em>and</em> transformed the technologies of
American life to serve the needs of Black people and all of its
citizens” <span class="citation"
data-cites="banksRaceRhetoricTechnology2006">(Banks 2006)</span>. As
many Black feminist and intersectional theories argue, supporting the
needs of multiply marginalized people often leads to more effective
support for many others.</p>
<p>Intersectionality, Kimberlé Crenshaw’s iconic analysis of
institutional power <span class="citation"
data-cites="crenshawDemarginalizingIntersectionRace1989">(Crenshaw
1989)</span>, “critiques systems of power and how those systems
structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally” <span
class="citation" data-cites="cooperIntersectionality2016">(Cooper
2016)</span>. Intersectionality can reveal the tangible human and
more-than-human costs entangled in these algorithmic systems – their
proliferating data and its material infrastructures, as well as their
consolidating power and its sociocultural infrastructures. Such power is
differential by design. Conversations about AI fairness, transparency,
explainability, ethics, public good, and the hype cycles of new
technologies are grossly incomplete without intersectional analyses of
power and intersectional tactics of (and beyond) equity and inclusion.
No change <em>about</em> us <em>without</em> us.</p>
<p>Yet industry implementations of so-called ethical tech reduce complex
concepts into flattened ideas of fairness and representation <span
class="citation"
data-cites="ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a">(Ovalle et al.
2023)</span>. Machine learning, as a mass production, produces certainty
from uncertainty. More precisely, argues political geographer Louise
Amoore, it produces a false sense of certainty from millions or billions
of small uncertainties, through its reductionist logics of probability
as prediction <span class="citation"
data-cites="amooreCloudEthicsAlgorithms2020">(Amoore 2020)</span>. These
uncertainties are also claims about “what we should know, how we should
know what we know, and how that knowledge should be deployed. Each
exposure to a dataset occurs because someone concluded that the
information in that dataset should be used to determine a possible
future” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hakopianInstituteOtherIntelligences2022">(Hakopian
2022)</span>. Since an algorithm is at its most simple a set of
instructions, of course it will contain the assumptions of those who
wrote those instructions. It will follow their beliefs about how to
implement that procedure. There are many ways to do any task, informed
by minute choices at every step. As these choices scale exponentially
with computation, the impact of these choices magnifies exponentially
too.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> They are compounded by the
computational speeds that allow thousands of operations to run per
second. Yet, because they are processed through algorithmic systems (and
a mythology of the black box), these choices get normalized,
naturalized, and neutralized.</p>
<p>Yes, in many cases it would be nice to have more, better data. But
the very valid criticism that algorithmic systems are biased because
their data are biased — often summed up “garbage in, garbage out” — sets
up a quest already doomed to fail. What would be better data? Or an
optimized system? For what goal, and for whom exactly? There is no such
thing as unbiased, there is only the right tool for the particular job,
or a given slice of information from a particular perspective with just
enough context for the purposes of a specific task. There is only “good
enough” data — and only sometimes, for some tasks. When the stakes are
too high, no data could be good enough to make life or death decisions.
We need a different approach. We cannot rely on computational systems
for infallibility and rationality, as we have been, nor can we look to
these technologies uncritically as bandaids for the problems they
exacerbate.</p>
<p>While the need for AI oversight is clear, many have been calling for
total overhaul and algorithmic justice, like computer scientist Joy
Buolamwini <span class="citation"
data-cites="buolamwiniAJLALGORITHMICJUSTICE">(Buolamwini n.d.)</span>.
[Still, practical applications of these valid critiques remain difficult
to implement.] How do we get there? Intersectional AI calls for
demystifying normative AI systems and learning from marginalized ethics
and tactics, in order to fundamentally transform AI. It requires
multimodal, polyvocal, experimental approaches that cut through the
technological solutionism <span class="citation"
data-cites="cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019">(Ciston 2019b)</span>.
It requires slow, long-term investments in algorithmic justice, rather
than extractive, performative forms of inclusion that erase friction,
context, and agency as they scale up for machine learning tasks <span
class="citation" data-cites="sloaneParticipationNotDesign2022">(Sloane
et al. 2022)</span>. As a term, ‘Trans*formative’ looks for root causes
and radical alternatives to the computational logics that perpetuate
[harmful systemic inequities].</p>

tech field is a moving target, entangled with race, gender, and
globalization politics.] Communications scholar Christina Dunbar-Hester
and others call for interventions that go deeper than training more
people in tech jobs, pointing out that this does little to examine the
structures that organize and value work sectors. She argues this calls
for “a larger reevaluation and appropriation of categories
themselves—the boundaries of what is ‘social’ and what is ‘technical’
are flexible categories” <span class="citation"
data-cites="dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019">(Dunbar-Hester
2019)</span>. As a term, ‘TechnoCraft’ looks more invitingly at how many
more people are potentially already engaged with sociotechnical
practices and implicated by them, as user-practitioners, data subjects
and subjectees, skilled crafters and critics.</p>
<p>We know code means more, if we let it. Code is collaborative, says
Mark C. Marino, who helped develop the practice of Critical Code
Studies. Code can be an inviting, interpretive practice: “Code’s meaning
is communal, subjective, opened through discussion and mutual inquiry,
to be contested and questioned, requiring creativity and
interdisciplinarity, enriched through the variety of its readers and
their backgrounds, intellectually and culturally” <span class="citation"
data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020a">(Marino 2020)</span>. Such
approaches invite the creation of hybrid communities that acknowledge
the interdisciplinary capacities of programming, and the diverse
capacities for knowledge.</p>
<p>This requires we reunite the divisions between theory and practice,
between user and programmer, which were artificially split from the
start <span class="citation"
data-cites="AlwaysalreadyprogrammingMda artistBlackGooeyUniverse nardiSmallMatterProgramming1993">(<span>“Always-Already-Programming.md”</span>
n.d.a; Artist n.d.; Nardi 1993)</span>. It requires un-siloing domains
and disciplines, the artificial boundaries that divide technologists
from activists and critics from creators. It requires we find common
language and common values that come with working knowledge of the whole
system. The technical how-to means (coding skills) and the
critical/analytical how-to means (analytical, political, aesthetic,
ethical contexts) and the material how-to means (data, energy, hardware)
have to combine and are inseparable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By reinforcing the idea that there is a split between theory and
practice or by creating such a split, both groups [elite academia and
anti-intellectuals] deny the power of liberatory education for critical
consciousness, thereby perpetuating conditions that reinforce our
collective exploitation and repression. &gt;–bell hooks <span
class="citation"
data-cites="hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994">(1994)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All making, all writing, all coding is a hybrid practice of creation
(poetics), critique (politics), and code (platforms and programmatic
systems). <!-- All code is writing and all writing is code.  --></p>
<p>How do we reunite these? We need access. We need everyone’s
contributions to be valued, for the effort toward understanding to be
mutual because all participants know that we each have important
contributions to make. Access includes many aspects. It requires
connecting an individual’s current understanding and circumstances to
the new knowledge step by step. It considers material, financial,
intellectual, social resources that allow for a variety of entry points.
I may be capable of understanding how a machine learning system works,
but not have the prerequisite vocabulary to enter a conversation in
order to learn about it. I may understand how to operate a machine
learning system, but not have the financial resources needed to run a
resource-intensive devices in order to use one. I may have knowledge and
resources to share, but not be able to participate because barrier-free
access, transcription, gender-inclusive language, or other inclusive
aspects were not prioritized by the organizers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be
used to educate the public.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994">(hooks
1994)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prioritizing access here means prioritizing common language. These
works are written as jargon-free as possible to allow them to travel as
broadly as possible. They also vary in methodology and modality in order
to access different audiences and spaces. They show how different ways
of knowing are necessary to engage the same questions, as well as how
different aspects of the questions must be addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p>This approach makes creativity and care part of its argument. These
are not additions, affectations, or antonyms to critical theory or
technical savvy, but rather they are central fortifications to the work.
Code work is critical work is care work is creative work.</p>
<p>Each of the works in <em>Trans*formative TechnoCraft</em> finds a
different balance of these elements but includes all four.
<em>Coding.Care: Field Notes for Making Friends with Code</em> gives
courage to pick up unfamiliar tools, find resources to kick off a new
programming project, pose questions critically, or solve problems
creatively. Its pocket-guide form discusses how to build a cooperative,
interdisciplinary community for co-learning coding like the one I have
facilitated since 2019. The <em>Intersectional AI Toolkit</em>’s
co-authored zines are accessible guides to both AI and
intersectionality, bringing together artists, activists, academics,
makers, technologists, and anyone who wants to understand the automated
systems that impact them. The work argues that established but
marginalized tactics are necessary for reimagining more critical and
ethical machine learning. Together these tools and resources ask:
<em>Whose voices, visions, and stories are captured by automated
systems? Whose are excluded, harmed, or undermined? How can AI systems
be accessible for anyone to engage and intervene in?</em> And <em>A
Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets</em>
translates critical AI theories and data science concepts into practical
tips for dataset stewardship. Along with the <em>Inclusive Datasets
Research Guide</em>, both guides combine technical skillbuilding and
critical thinking for scholars and practitioners beginning to work with
datasets, because datasets remain the foundation of machine learning as
it grows rapidly in impact. And brief lyric essays offer interludes to
the major works as oblique refractions of their topics.</p>
<p>These works emerge from my artistic research (also called
research-creation or arts-based research in different lineages and
regions). Artistic research is neither research that produces art, nor a
scholarly presentation of art, nor a creative presentation of research,
but instead a hybrid practice of “creation-as-research” and
research-as-creation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By bringing research and creation together in such a way that they
unpredictably contaminate and remake each other, in such a way that they
render each other uncanny, research-creation makes space in the
university for research practices that are grounded in nonhegemonic
literacies […]” “in failing to fully belong, and allowing that
nonbelonging to denaturalize, emergently, its givens, research-creation
tells other stories, uncanny stories, that (have the potential to) carry
within them […] other ethics” <span class="citation"
data-cites="lovelessHowMakeArt2019">(Loveless 2019)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strategies for combining creative and critical practices have been
eloquently described elsewhere <span class="citation"
data-cites="willisFastForwardFuture2016 lovelessHowMakeArt2019 fournierAutotheoryFeministPractice2021">(Willis
2016; Loveless 2019; Fournier 2021)</span>. In my own artistic research,
I am particularly interested in process-oriented experimentation and in
how artistic experiments can challenge paradigms in machine learning,
data science, and technology communities. I have found artistic research
practices can interrogate systems and imagine new ones. For me, artistic
research combines rigorous scholarly investigation, deep community
building and activism, and creative play in ways that facilitate
connections to broader non-academic audiences.</p>
<p>Art has been the space where I am able to unpack complex ideas for
myself, because I can treat them more freely as artistic materials. It
is where I am able to follow instinct and feel into how my tools,
platforms, and forms shape their outputs and outcomes. It is also the
space where I feel able to imagine wildly, creating digital objects that
should exist but don’t, or couldn’t exist but might.</p>
<p>Artistic research opens space beyond research questions, where
research tensions live. In that space, I can sit a bit longer with
questions I know I cannot answer, questions that make me uneasy. I can
hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously and let them push–pull me,
forgiving myself imperatives and outcomes, productivity and proven
hypotheses. I can put myself into the trouble, because I already embody
these questions in my lived experience.</p>
<p>In my experience, this imaginative work is central to supporting very
practical next steps and strategies. It is central to supporting more
open access to communities of practice where others can continue the
kinds of artistic experimentation that challenge paradigms in new forms
I might never imagine. In such contexts, argues [XXX-ID] Holly Willis,
“arts-based research is rooted in critical theory, framing the research
process within the context of power, emancipation and a deep questioning
of the ethical and ideological implications of knowledge and change”
<span class="citation" data-cites="willisFastForwardFuture2016">(Willis

<p>What does Trans*formative Technocraft look like? How could it
operate? Where does happen it already? What is it exactly? I hope we can
figure that out together. The works of <em>Trans*formative
TechnoCraft</em> are experiments and instructions for myself/ves,
past-present-future, gathering tactics from many traditions, making
connections, collecting strategies, and wayfinding for the kinds of
worlds and systems I want to [be part of/join/create]. As a phrase,
‘Trans*formative TechnoCraft’ both proposes and describes a present
possibility — an intersectional [trans*feminist] approach to [reading
and relating to] emergent technological systems. Each part of the phrase
says so much more about the whole.</p>

<h2>Trans*formative</h2>
<!-- Transience, Translucence -->
<!-- glyphs, emoji, runes -->
<p>Trans*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It
means process-oriented, community-oriented practices. It means making
space for and honoring what we figure out as we go along, [adjusting and
tailoring to the needs and goals of our specific situations as we
operate in community].</p>
<p>‘Transformative’ includes transformative justice, which recognizes
that oppressive systems are at the root of technological harms. It
argues that acknowledging systemic oppression is essential to addressing
those harms and shifting away from carceral logics and toward healing
systems. Transformative justice seeks repair beyond punishment, focusing
not only on remedying wrongs but more broadly on instituting
infrastructures of care <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"

cleaning up the data. Our fight is not for an unbiased algorithm,
because we don’t believe that even mathematically, there could be an
unbiased algorithm for policing at all.” […] “The goal is always to be

new. Though this ‘newness’, or the demand for something else, can never
fully be realised in the realm of the discursive, it exists in other
registers: it can be felt, heard, touched, tasted. The structural limits
of this world restrict our ability to articulate all that the

<p>Transformers are a current type of machine learning architecture
being employed to create large models like ChatGPT and Stable

clumps of text, images, video — all interpreted as numbers — and
reconstituting them. Transformers main parts are called encoders and
decoders, and it’s often said that even their designers don’t know what
exactly is going on in these hidden layers. We can discuss the specifics
of that elsewhere (see Interstitial: Codes for Un/Knowing). I find it
more interesting that the <em>transformers themselves</em> do not know
what is going on in these hidden layers of the own architecture —
despite all the anthropomorphizing of AI systems, with widespread use of
terms like “learning” and “understanding.” While they process and
produce meaning (input and output), transformers are never “aware” of
the meaning of the content they are processing along the way. They are
just crunching numbers.</p>

of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees<a href="#fn7"

<p>To move from the “transformer” model architecture to trans*formative

and supporting in turn.</p>

<p>Trans* can be inclusive, fluid, in motion, outside binary logics,
self-identifying, evolving, emergent, embodied. <em>Trans*formative
TechnoCraft</em> imagines systems that can also have these qualities,
that can trans*cend the logics constructed by capitalist, militaristic,
racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“queerness is itself inherent within [the history of] computational

</blockquote>
<p>(See also trans*feminist and crip technosciences below)</p>
<p>Trans* also finds queer reverberations in the transducers all around
us that constitute and reinforce computational systems. A transducer
(from Latin for ‘lead across’) converts physical signals into electrical
signals, or vice versa. Trans*ducers are intermediaries that allow the
trans*fer between analogue to digital. Every time information gets
trans*mitted from an environmental sensor to a digital device — sound
waves into audio files, optical variation into heart rate —
trans*duction has occurred, and thus some kind of trans*formation. (Note
how many times trans*-ness appears in sites of cybernetic knowing.)
These reimaginings of information’s forms are always interventions,
informed by the device designers’ decisions as well as both contemporary
and historical approaches to computational knowing. The material
conversions required to power the logics of computation (turning
qualities into voltages into quantities) all pass through gates of
trans* thinking.</p>

<h3>* (asterisk)</h3>
<p>The <code>*</code> after <code>trans</code> longs for anything that
follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming, and
as such can include anyone who wonders if they belong, who wonders what
they contribute, who wonders what “this whole thing” is about (be it
gender, sexuality, technology, whatever).</p>
<p>Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial.
It is a footnote that defines our terms, and also it is the invitation
to extend beyond any definition given.</p>
<p>The asterisk is a perturbation, a pebble in the shoe. In the German
language, the gendering of nouns and verbs is haphazardly addressed by
an asterisk that breaks the word, introduces a glottal stop between its
‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ formations. <code>Student</code> or
<code>Studentin</code> becomes <code>Student*in</code>;
<code>Bäcker</code> or <code>Bäckerin</code> becomes
<code>Bäcker*in</code>. This brief interruption can be read as a faulty
solution that maintains gender-as-binary, it’s true. And also, this
hesitation adds a frequent awkwardness that highlights how often
conversation is about gender unnecessarily. It physically opens up a
space (in the mouth) where gender is unknown/unstable/all.</p>
<p>A French or English apostrophe may mark an omission of letters, but
this elision also joins together, suturing up the distance it creates.
The asterisk shares this tension here, as a clot that heals, an
unspeakable but audible gasp.</p>
<p>Like the apostrophe at the start of <code>'pataphysics</code>, which
gestures to the absurdity from which it springs, the asterisk is the
instigator and the multiplier, the pivot and the punctum and the
portal.</p>
<p>It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It
is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations,
abstracted away. It’s not a redaction which the asterisk marks, but the
possibilities of unknown language underneath. Or the tension of knowing
and not saying, as in the marking of <code>sw*@r</code> words. [Again,
queer as a politics, “queer as in fuck you.”]</p>
<p>The asterisk is risk (just a step), is starry-eyed, A-star
pathfinding, ASCII joy, a wry smile, and a mark of possibility on a
treasure map. In mathematics the asterisk is duality, mirrors mirroring
each other, points connecting to make lines and lines crossing to make
points, weak-star topologies <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"

<h3>Formative</h3>
<p>What is formative shapes us. Our early experiences make us who we
are. These are the foundations we can’t see, the scaffolding of our
thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the
formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops
of human networks, codified language, and rare earth. How we become. How
we become with and through sociotechnical systems.</p>
<p>Each of the works [that follow/collected here] asks: What are the
fundamental assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a
dataset, a machine learning system, or programmers themselves? What are
the formative assumptions underlying any technology or way of being?
These works tease out the metaphors we have relied on so long we can no
longer see them; they ask what other metaphors might make space for new
forms or reforms.</p>
<p>Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can
fill it. [I work in code and in art because I believe:] If I know how to
make forms, or even platforms, not only the content to plug into
existing forms, I am more free to work both form and content in
iterative, ongoing relationships. This is how I knead the dough — form
and content and form and content and form. They are inseparable.</p>
<p>In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make,
through its insistence, resistence, grain, thread tension. It in-forms
itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. It also
re-forms me through this mutual process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In both carpentry and textiles, the form of a thing does not stand
over it or lie behind it but emerges from this mutual shaping, within a
gathering of forces, both tensile and frictional, established through
the engagement of the practitioner with materials that have their own
inclinations and vitality.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold 2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Form activates. No form is neutral, although if we use it long enough
we begin to look through it, like the blank page, or the MS Word ‘blank
page’. Each interface or material enables or encourages particular
experiences and outcomes, and denies or deflects others — whether
through predictive text in search, syntax highlighting in code, or the
constraint of an eight-page paper zine. Some forms invite us to
collaborate in imagining the usefulness of their limits and the
boundlessness in their constraints. [Through time spent in process,
working with and against form, our focus can shift from producing
outputs that meet the brief of the form, to working with the form to
reshape both the form and ourselves in new understandings and new
orientations.]</p>
<p>Yet current modes of computational logic are not mutually
constitutive in trans*formative ways. Instead, they impose form on us as
data subjects and subjectees. Computation requires information to take
any output formations. Its orderly logic is a shape imposed by and
reflecting the world. It requires contortion to represent us. As media
theorist Sarah Sharma reminds us, for the ‘Broken Machines’ who do not
quite fit these regimes, “to represent is also to be filed away” <span
class="citation" data-cites="sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020">(Sharma
2020)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In order to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your
solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make
comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce. […] perhaps we
need to bring an end to the very notion of a scale. Displace all
reduction. Agree not merely to the right to difference but, carrying
this further, agree also to the right to opacity that is [not enclosure
within an impenetrable autarchy but] subsistence within an irreducible
singularity. Opacities can coexist and converge, weaving fabrics. To
understand these truly one must focus on the texture of the weave and
not on the nature of its components. For the time being, perhaps, give
up this oid obsession with discovering what lies at the bottom of
natures. There would be something great and noble about initiating such
a movement, referring not to Humanity but ta the exultant divergence of
humanities. Thought of self and thought of other here become obsolete in
their duality. Every Other is a citizen and no longer a barbarian. What
is here is open, as much as this there. 1 would be incapable of
projecting from one to the other. This-here is the weave, and it weaves
no boundaries. The right to opacity would not establish autism; it would
be the real foundation of Relation, in freedoms.” <span class="citation"

<p>To understand through computation is to reduce to categorization’s
logics <span class="citation"
data-cites="crawfordAtlasAIPower2021 amaroBlackTechnicalObject2022">(Crawford
2021; Amaro 2022)</span>. The formative structures we create
(taxonomies, schemas, ways of knowing) support unknowing. They ease and
smooth passage through our days and our systems. This is why we must
imagine new forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new
forms.</p>
<p>Code forms, then calcifies. Pattern turns to template. In the
procedures of object-oriented programming languages, the pattern runs:
<code>init --&gt; name --&gt; get --&gt; set</code><a href="#fn12"

</blockquote>
<p>If forms shape content, and vice versa, of course tools also shape
forms. Equipping ourselves with the knowledge, resources, and agency to
make the tools (to make the platforms to make the forms to make the
content) is necessary for a more holistic approach to researching
formative tech and creating trans*formative tech. Toolmaking includes
collecting sets of tools, documenting and creating guides to existing
tools as well. It also includes the infrastructures and support systems
necessary to make any of these practices possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“tools and infrastructure are not only the preconditions for the
work; at their best, they are also part and parcel of the work, deeply
integrated into its methods and outcomes. Our tools and infrastructures
are rich objects to think with.” <span class="citation"

<blockquote>
<p>“instruments develop through engaged and contingent practices.

potentially transforming. Instruments—whether in the form of concepts or
sensors—are instrumental to the unfolding, the doing, and the
transforming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="gabrysHowThingsSensors2019">(Gabrys 2019)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think with our tools, instruments, sensors and the surrounding
systems that enable them and maintain them. All of these layers are
entangled. Susan Leigh Star calls infrastructure a “fundamentally
relational concept,” but one that despite its embeddedness operates
invisibly unless broken. She also argues that infrastructure marks
membership in relational groups, as we “acquire a naturalized
familiarity with its objects,” practices, and standards <span
class="citation"
data-cites="starEthnographyInfrastructure1999">(1999)</span>. Thus
infrastructure — and the tools, platforms, forms, and content that it
consists of — also marks us as belonging, knowing, capable, welcome, or
not.</p>
<p>How do we think critically through re/making infrastructures, when
they exist beyond any one of us, always relational and often invisible?
By returning to, and reattuning to, the solidarities we find within and
across communities, and the frictions we find within and across
materials.</p>
<p>Those who are left unsupported by infrastructures, those who are left
out of representations or who are targeted disproportionately by digital
systems, already know in deeply embodied ways about the friction they
feel as they move through systems that do not easily contain their
forms. Scholars Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsche, authors of the “Crip
Technoscience Manifesto” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span>, call
these infrastructures “frictioned technologies” and emphasize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the skills, wisdom, resources, and hacks disabled people utilize for
navigating and altering inaccessible worlds. In pushing crip
technoscience as a field of research and a practice of critical
‘knowing-making’, we conjure frictional practices of access production,
acknowledging that science and technology can be used to both produce
and dismantle injustice.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their manifesto reminds us that disabled people are not minoritized
users of technologies created by experts but instead are experts
themselves at actively adapting technologies to their needs. [This holds
true for many other minoritized communities as well.] By centering their
community as knowledge holders and creators, and by seeing
“interdependence as a political technology,” they shift the design goals
for technology. Rather than outsiders providing services to achieve
normalized individual independence, they reorient toward kinship
building <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Louise Hickman’s ethnographic work on the ethics of access
foregrounds access workers’ key role in the production of crip
technoscientific knowledge. She examines the highly customized
dictionaries developed by her own Communication Access Real-Time
Translation operator working in academic spaces, in order to show how
their captioning work for the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community is
“both the practice of crip technoscience as well as its product.”
Hickman highlights the collaborative, embedded nature of the work and
the crip technoscience emphasis on “knowledge-from-below.” <span

<p>Thus, form is always forming from within complex systems of
interrelation. Formative and transformative technologies are more (and
less) than their forms. They must emerge on our own terms — from the
formats and methods of the communities they serve, with our values,
goals, and approaches leading the way.</p>
<p>Interdependence has been my intuitive compass, my frustration and
fascination, for as long as I remember. I have searched for the means to
describe this feeling, through art, literature, touch, and other means.
Slowly and repeatedly, I keep finding that the best resources for
describing this sense of interdependence come from Indigenous sources. I
keep returning to the realization that
<code>Interdependence is indigenous knowledge.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“an object or thing is not as important as one’s relationship to it.
[…] reality <em>is</em> relationships or sets of relationships.” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008">(Wilson
2008)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally reorienting our understanding of objects and knowledge
and ourselves as consituted by our relationships necessarily also
reorients our work and the forms it takes, in deeply formative ways.
Re-prioritizing relationships fundamentally reshapes the forms and
functions of research, artmaking, valuemaking, worldmaking. To see form
(shape, object) as relation (connection) is to position it in time and
place. It is also to take “form” from its noun form (shape, object) into
its verb form (mold, press, begin to exist). [As Erin Manning says of
the spiral, it is “more duration than form” <span class="citation"
data-cites="manningAlwaysMoreOne2013">(Manning 2013)</span>.] Like all
verbs, then, the verb form implies subjects — the entities enacting and
impressing a form into being, responsible for it, caring for it.
Relationships. [This negates object-oriented ontologies and
object-oriented programs that want to encapsulate and abstract away
objects’ entanglements with the world.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There can, of course, be no knots without the performance of
knotting: we should therefore commence with the verb ‘to knot’ and view
knotting as an activity of which ‘knots’ are the emergent outcomes. Thus
conceived, knotting is about how contrary forces of tension and
friction, as in pulling tight, are generative of new forms. And it is
about how forms are held in place within such a force-field or, in
short, about ‘making things stick’. Accordingly, our focus should be on
forces and materials rather than form and content.” <span
class="citation" data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold
2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To frame research through relationships is also to foreground
accountability by asking, as Shawn Wilson offers in <em>Research Is
Ceremony</em>, “What am I contributing or giving back to the
relationship? Is the sharing, growth and learning that is taking place
reciprocal?” Wilson says that in an Indigenous Research Paradigm, “What
is more important and meaningful is fulfilling a role and obligations in
the research relationship—that is, being accountable to your relations”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008">(2008)</span>.</p>
<p>In this sense of reciprocity, the question of form takes shape as an
offering. What does our creative work offer back, and in what form will
that offering be most legible and accessible? Some forms I have tried:
manifesto, toolkit, zine, prototype, platform, black box, machine,
labyrinth, server, service, sentence, story, interface, guide, document,
cauldron, process.</p>
<p>As form moves into its verb shapes, identity too moves into practice.
Johanna Hedva marks this as a pivot from identity politics to practices
and methods, inextricably coupled as theory-practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Disability, queerness, open source — not as identities, or groups I
belong to, but as modes of doing, of how I practice myself. Being an
outsider means that the question of theory and practice — how practice
is affected by theory, how theory is constructed by practice — becomes
the most important one. Membership to particular groups and experiences
is often predicated on the visual — whether someone ‘looks like’ they
belong or not — which means that my membership to most groups must rely
on something else. My belonging has more to do with how I enact that
group’s politic” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hedvaBelongingMess2018">(Hedva 2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our being-in-process is both the means to “be” (prefiguratively) and
also the means of being-in-relation, -in-politic, -in-identity,
in-between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“this form is really just the web of relationships that have taken on
a familiar shape. Every individual thing that you see around you is
really just a huge knot-a point where thousands and millions of
relationships come together.” <span class="citation"

Anna Munster suggests that the form of networks numbs us to their
relationality. Because every network looks like every other, in trying
to understand a system by depicting it as a network, we lose sense of
what’s within. Munster suggests focusing less on <code>forms</code> and
more on <code>forces</code>: “the closures and openings of relations to
one another. It is at this level of imperceptible flux—of things
unforming and reforming relationally—that we discover the real
experience of networks” <span class="citation"

includes us. It comes from us.</p>
<p>Though “TechnoCraft” reads like an oxymoron,
technology-as-craftsmanship is nothing new. In an ethnography of AI
developers, Lucy Suchman and Randall Trigg referred to artificial
intelligence as ‘craftwork’. In what they called “socially organized
craftsmanship,” they saw “the work of designing intelligent machines as
a specific form of social practice - a form made the more interesting by
AI’s own concern with the delegation of social practice to machines”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="suchmanArtificialIntelligenceCraftwork1993">(Suchman and
Trigg 1993)</span>. Suchman and Trigg invoke craft as an opening for
critique, noting the distance between the formalist constraints on AI
problem design and the innumerable variables of its real-world
applications.</p>
<p>Here, I apply craft lenses to tech concerns both as a critique and
also as a return. TechnoCraft, here, is an expression of the theories,
ethics, and tactics of intersectionality and sustainability, grounded in
tangible practices which grow out of community. Re-binding craft to
technology evokes slow, circular, cooperative, inclusive, caring
practices that can transform materials and practitioners alike.</p>
<p>Here, I invoke the phrase “TechnoCraft” to bring technology off its
awe-inducing pedestal and put it back into our hands — recalling the
human agency, access, and scale which emerging technologies
[always-already] require. Reframing tech as craft moves the focus of
technologies like programming and machine learning back onto their
practitioners and their material relationships. Physicist and activist
Ursula M. Franklin compares “holistic technologies” like artisan crafts
which center on the practitioner, to “prescriptive technologes,” which
are focused on production, scale, effectiveness and management. She says
that under the effects of prescriptive technologies, “we live in a
culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept
orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing
‘it.’” Meanwhile holistic technologies require muscle memory and
instinct; they allow the practitioner to “draw on their own experience,
each time applying it to a unique situation” <span class="citation"
data-cites="franklinRealWorldTechnology2004">(Franklin 2004)</span>.
Pairing ‘tech’ with ‘craft’ returns focus to the human-scale aspects of
the technological imaginary, from the labor required to produce and
maintain technological objects, to the impacts and harms it produces as
part of human-driven sociotechnical systems, to the knowledge adapted
(and co-opted) from unacknowledged domains and communities of
practice.</p>
<p>TechnoCraft remembers that technology are procedures and protocols,
as well as tools and materials. Franklin frames technology as a
practice: It is the way things are done, not only the tools with which
they are done — a system that includes “far more than its individual
material components. Technology involves organization, procedures,
symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.” This shows
technology’s deep link with culture <span class="citation"
data-cites="franklinRealWorldTechnology2004">(Franklin 2004)</span>.
While the English language separates object from practice from person,
in German, <code>die Technik</code> means both ‘the technology’ (object)
and also ‘the technique’, ‘the method’, or ‘the procedure’. In Spanish,
<code>la técnica</code> means all of these, as well as the ‘the
engineer’ or ‘the repairwoman’.</p>
<p>TechnoCraft remembers technology is made through practices, by people
and for people, meant to care for people, and we can learn from people
in its making and implementation. Holding these
[components/correspondences] in relation lets us examine and address the
issues of technologies more comprehensively and holistically:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is in these mechanisms, logics, techniques, and practices, not
merely in the machines, that we must locate our current predicament. And
it is in these that we shall ﬁnd surprising connections that locate
differently.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022">(Dhaliwal
2022)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TechnoCraft remembers how to operate by slow consideration in and for
community, in contrast to ego-driven technocratic prostheletizing that
believes technology can fix technology by moving faster and breaking
more.</p>
<p>TechnoCraft places the seemingly contrasting terms ‘tech’ and ‘craft’
together to show how they are not contradictory, after all. TechnoCraft
can be analog or hybrid, systems-oriented, process-oriented, human- and
more-than-human. Technology and Craft are two complementary approaches,
two aspects of the same effort that build on one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a craft approach to digital technologies supports intuitive practice
that operates creative and aesthetic knowing, leading to technical or
scientific insight and ultimately innovation.” <span class="citation"

<section id="what-craft-allows" class="level3">
<h3>What craft allows</h3>
<p>Many have paired code with craft, or talked about the similarities of
knitting or weaving with programming. Yes, TechnoCraft celebrates these
similarities and wants to decontextualize the linear histories of
computer programming, but also wants to push this argument further. It
argues that not only should we bring craft’s materials into coding
spaces, but also we should bring craft’s ethos and ethics into coding
spaces as well. It’s not enough to weave electronics into our fiber arts
as a way to build technical literacy; we need to weave intersectional
methods and mindsets into technical arts. Craft carries many of these
methods and mindsets in its material culture. This section will discuss
a few of these aspects.</p>
<p>Focusing on craft means noticing the material, handworked, skilled,
tinkered, iterative, process-oriented, embodied (intersectional)
practices of knowledge and production that technologies emerge from. It
means noticing how such practices can intervene in existing technologies
and reshape emerging ones. It acknowledges human choices; built skills,
tacit knowledge, and material needs; networks and communities of
practice.</p>
<section id="first-a-note-on-what-craft-is-not" class="level4">
<h4>(First, a note on what craft is not)</h4>
<p>While this text aruges for craft as a materialization of
intersectional theories, ethics, and tactics, which can help apply them
to emerging technologies — craft is not the only way to do
intersectional practice, and not all craft is intersectional
practice.</p>
<p>Craft includes many forms, from fiber arts to woodworking to
programming to writing — but craft here refers to practice, process,
making, and learning, rather than mastery over a skill in order to gain
status or maintain status quo. In contrast to process-oriented crafting,
performance artist and poet Fargo Nissim Tbakhi says that literary craft
“is a counterrevolutionary machine.” High-art notions of craft use
“aesthetics” to refine work toward the polite and proper, in order to
rob them of political power. Tbakhi explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Craft which is taught in Western institutions, taken up and
reproduced by Western publishers, literary institutions, and awards
bodies, is a set of regulatory ideas which curtail forms of speech that
might enact real danger to the constellation of economic and social
values which are, as I write this, facilitating genocide in Palestine
and elsewhere across the globe. […] Craft is the process by which our
own real liberatory tools are dulled, confiscated, and replaced. We
believe our words sharper than they turn out to be. […] what Craft does
to our writing: pressures and pressures until what matters, what we need
to say, gets pushed to the margins or disappeared entirely.” <span
class="citation" data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine
2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tbakhi speaks of craft that responds to (and enacts) institutional
measuring, monitoring, regard, and power. This is the craft of euphemism
and nihilism. Such craft is the milquetoast technical fix to machine
learning’s ‘fairness’ problems that replaces offending text like ‘dyke’,
because it cannot tell the difference between a slur and a community. It
replaces offending text with boilerplate diversity speak that comes out
both toothless and simultaneously ‘too woke’. It replaces offending text
but offers nothing intsead, and the chasm that remains is all some of us
get to know of ourselves from generative AI systems. I agree with Tbakhi
about this kind of craft, when he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Craft is what keeps us polite while the boot is on our neck or on
somebody else’s. And we cannot afford that, not now and not going
forward.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine 2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But craft need not stay polite or straighten its rough edges.
“Anticolonial writers in the U.S. and across the globe have long modeled
alternative crafts which reject these priorities, and continue to do so
in this present moment. Yet Craft still haunts our writing” <span
class="citation" data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine
2023)</span> Despite this haunting, other engagements with craft — craft
as community, craft as lineage, craft as experimentation, craft as
resistance — can also help us to reject the institutional and
infrastructural claims to our voices.</p>
<p>Reclaiming craft does not mean [becoming/focusing] so small that we
cannot be effective nor so precious [about aesthetics] that we lose the
cause. It does not mean a return to luddite nostalgia: Everything was
<em>not</em> simpler in the past, except for the few people who held
more power over others (same as now). Reclaiming craft from its
feminized, domesticized, racialized pejoratives and applying craft as a
lens for technology practices means embracing its scrappy imperfections
and [revolutionary] potentials.</p>
</section>
<section id="scale" class="level4">
<h4>Scale</h4>
<p>Craft scales much differently than a machine learning system, and
these frictions can be used for aesthetic investigation and activist
resistence. Detailed hand labor is a critical tactic available to tackle
the seemingly insurmountable scale of the increasingly giant datasets,
obscured models, and complex infrastructures. For example, Everest
Pipkin viewed every single video in a large dataset over the course of
months and turned this labor into a series of artistic investigations
<span class="citation"
data-cites="pipkinLaceworkWatchingEntire2020">(Pipkin 2020)</span>. At
the Knowing Machines research project (I discuss my work with them more
in the “Formative” section), interdisciplinary researchers from
journalists to programmers to lawyers work together to create tools to
explore changes in foundational image datasets like ImageNet <span
class="citation" data-cites="crawfordWaysSeeDataset">(Crawford et al.,
n.d.)</span>. These practices apply human-scale attention to
machine-scale systems in order to reveal their obscured innerworkings.
Just because a system is larger than life does not make it impossible to
apply human techniques to investigate it. While the gargantuan
computational scale makes it more tedious, this human-scale labor is
still an incredibly important response for understanding and confronting
algorithmic harms.</p>
<p>For Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, texture is a way of talking about the
space between dimensions or scales, or the transition between them. I
have found her metaphoric comparison useful and have extended it to
machine learning: * From point to line to cube to cube in space-time to
multidimensional universes of vibrating strings. * From ball to string
to loop to fabric to garment. * From scalar to vector to matrix to
tensors in many dimensions.</p>
<p>Sedgwick describes the many directions of touch and contact across a
surface and between dimensions, warp and weft of all kinds. She builds
on this a theory of relationality, which understands the reciprocity of
contact, the reciprocity of creating and being, and the fractal nature
of scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the sense of touch makes nonsense out of any dualistic understanding
of agency and passivity; to touch is always already to reach out, to
fondle, to heft, to tap or enfold, and always also to understand other
people or natural forces as having effectually done so before oneself,
if only in the making of the textured object.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="sedgwickWeatherProust2012">(Sedgwick 2012)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Sedgwick connects the experience of making craftwork with
experiencing the made craft, with touching and being touched by, and
with multidimensional sense and scale. I also see this as a way of
understanding machine learning modeling through new, non-hierarchical
metaphors of TechnoCraft. What is the scale and dimensionality of
machine learning? Does it “dramatize its dimensional betweenness,” as
Sedgwick describes the way a folded dyed fabric or a paper snowflake,
once unfolded, retains the memory of past shapes? <span class="citation"
data-cites="sedgwickWeatherProust2012">(Sedgwick 2012)</span>. Or Ingold
similarly describes the way once knotted ropes retain their bends: “But
the knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget” [<span
class="citation" data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">Ingold
(2015)</span>][, and Laura Marks says “electrons remember” <span
class="citation" data-cites="marksTouchSensuousTheory2002">(Marks
2002)</span>]? These material memories, as marks of their current and
past states simultaneously, could be tangible metaphors for
understanding machine learning, or even quantum computing (folding was a
fascination of quantum physicist David Bohm). They show that, when
working with any material, the material works back.</p>
<p>Thinking through technology with a TechnoCraft lens opens more points
of reference for addressing complexity and complex systems that prexist
the emergent techonlogies we are encountering now. It reminds us that we
can slip between scales to find apt materials and metaphors for
grappling with the complexity of systems more approachably and
sustainably. Movements across scales, and finding the spaces between and
resistances to scale, are also useful explorations. What gets lost in
the increase, and what is gained (to whose benefit) as we move either
direction?</p>

<p>“As hand knitting inclined to the margins as a [large-scale] viable

<h4>Sustain(ability)</h4>

</blockquote>
<p>Craft suggests more time spent with one’s objects and materials —
allowing for repair, error, and air. For woodworker Christopher Schwarz,
it means simple tools known well, a small collection of tools in a
toolbox that can be carried with you anywhere in order to complete your
work, providing freedom and autonomy <span class="citation"
data-cites="schwarzAnarchistToolChest2010">(Schwarz 2010)</span>. It
accumulates through simple gestures repeated until they become habit
(muscle memory, durational practices, implicit knowledge), repeated
until they become complex patterns (quilts, quines rice kolams),
repeated until they make space for other things to happen in their
presence (sewing circles, hacker spaces, political action). Imagine a
simple machine learning tool as easy to pick up as a garden trowel.
Would this be an all-purpose ‘multi-tool’ like today’s resource-hungry
giant language models? No. But its users would have freedom to imagine
their own goals and outcomes from a broad range of possibilities they
design themselves. Imagine if machine learning systems were built from
these operating principles instead of requiring such massive financial
resources, natural resource, and human resources to operate that only a
few huge conglomerates can particpate in their creation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Builder Alexander Langland returns to the older definition of
‘craeft’ as a lifesustaining skill built over generations. He sees
craftwork as holistic interrelation rather than individual objects or
skills. He says, “Crafts have always been determined by the immediate
environment, and indexed to the resources of the natural world.” Imagine
if we saw technology’s global supply chains as the integrated lifecycle
of care that Langland describes, which starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“tended landscape &gt; sustainable production of raw materials &gt;
intelligently processed &gt; beautifully made &gt; fit for purpose &gt;
fondly used &gt; ingeniously reused &gt; considerately discarded &gt;

<section id="infrastructures-of-care" class="level4">
<h4>Infrastructures of care</h4>
<p>Approaching technology through the lens of craft slows it down and
asks it to sustain. It also [organizes people, labor, and relations]
differently. Anthropolgist Gabriella (Biella) Coleman aligns hacking
with crafting, focusing on the “intellectual guile” required for both
and the guild-like communities that form. “[A]ll hackers fit the bill as
quintessential ‘craftspeople,’ […] Even if craftspeople tend to work in
solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on
shared rules of engagement and standards for quality” <span
class="citation" data-cites="colemanHackers2016">(Coleman Tue,
06/07/2016 - 12:00)</span>. Consider the transfeminist server, which
approaches its technology as a crafted, social, interrelational
object:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“rosa [travelling server] is not only constituted in hardware or
sotware, but also the multitude of relations that are created around the
making, maintaining and passing on of this infrastructure: the processes
that are performed, the affective charge of their actioning, the
community around them.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="TraversalNetworkFeminista">(<span>“A Traversal Network of

</blockquote>
<p>Feminist servers run slowly. Sustaining them takes “years of intense
collective learning,” replete with uncomfortable tensions and messy
differences. These very ambivalances, argues Ines Kleesattle, are
crucial for Feminist Server Art, because they demonstrate the relational
labor going unseen in other approaches to technology. “All kinds of
infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor”
(Kleesattel in <span class="citation"
data-cites="sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021">(Sollfrank, Stalder, and
Niederberger 2021)</span>). When giant data centers run in a far-flung
artic landscapes, and large language models siphon water and energy and
human effort for their training, these “cloud” technologies are not
ephemeral or immaterial – and feminist projects move slowly to enact the
material, relational stakes in all digital interactions, to show how
they might be organized with more awareness and care.</p>

practices and interactions around it? How can servers be pedagogical
spaces for experimentation for those with different knowledges?” [varia
email list 28.11.2023]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft requires taking care and caretaking, as does technology.
Transfeminist infrastructure work shows how the logics and ethics of
craft – especially its domestic and feminized aspects – emerge out of
intersectional feminist approaches and apply to technological questions.
To consider technology as entangled with its affective and labor
relations, as feminist infrastructures do, resituates tech back into a
variety of communities of practice and reframes its relationship to
caretaking. Although many have looked to technological solutions like
bots to address issues of labor and caretaking, more often technology
itself requires caretakers and creates more care labor. To respond to
this, feminist infrastructures show how care is generated through human
networks and how care might also be generated in, rather than depleted
by, digital ones. They place technology within a circuit of human
relations rather than as a replacement for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care,
but also to generate care. [… G]enerating care means counting in
participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to
succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation
indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of
understanding.” <span class="citation"

<p>Along with the traveling Raspberry Pi server “rosa” that acted as
their working hub, the Traversal Network project culminated in a print
and digital publication that reflected on the different groups’ shared
and diverse approaches. By choosing “low-effort publishing tools” like
<a href="https://etherdump.vvvvvvaria.org/">varia etherdump</a>, by
providing strategic services like analog infrastructure for mutual aid,
as well as digital infrastructure like hosting archives and zombie sites
of ongoing work, feminist servers like <a
href="https://anarchaserver.org/">Anarchaserver</a> create and codify
solidarity networks using multiple mediums and tactics. These are forms
of “feminist convergence” that embody their values through their choice
of methods and material offerings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For us feminist infrastructure enables the systematization, the
maintenance and the circulation of good ideas, practice and care. For
us, solidarity networks are an example of feminist infrastructure. And
we think it represents one of our earliest feminist technologies,
perhaps the oldest and the most widespread.” <span class="citation"

<p>For infrastructures of care, communities themselves are the essential
networks; the servers, databases, workshops, services, both digital and
analog are all tools toward building and means of expressing those
community networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The internet can bring us very close, yes, but it is even better to
meet <em>cuerpa</em>-to-<em>cuerpa</em>. The presence of the others
gives us the feeling of ecstacy, makes us float. Meeting gives us power
and energy, facilitates processes, and intensifies networks of trust and
cooperation. Sometimes we converge in our disputed territories, the
street the networks, and the servers, and other times in places where we
can create spaces of security, confidence, and relaxation.” <span

<p>A variety of forms and modalities allows for more kinds of access.
Craft, and other means of creating forms, helps imagine what access is
possible and who might be missing out. For example, zine-making and zine
distribution networks precede digital networks, provide models for
digital practices while subsisting alongside them. This publishing craft
is a counterinfrastructure used to build counterpublics and underground
communities, to create counterarchives or living texts <span
class="citation" data-cites="ademaLivingBooks350">(Adema 350AD)</span>,
and to clarify information to new audiences. Feminist media historian
Cait McKinney’s research into underground lesbian networks, both analog
and digital, shows that “lesbian-feminist information infrastructures
are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration
and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020">(McKinney
2020)</span>. Marginalized, precarious conditions of queer communities
has called for interventions by alternative means. Graphic designer Paul
Soulellis, who maintains the Queer Archive Work project, suggests that
zines are archives of crisis: “evidence of queer life persists in the
urgent artifacts that emerge in crisis — artifacts that arise
expediently as part of efforts to advocate for slowness, care,
mutuality, queer joy, pleasure, refusal, and community” <span
class="citation" data-cites="soulellisBadArchives2023">(Soulellis
2023)</span>. The precarity of these communities requires more care and
more flexible materials, and it also facilitates innovation. McKinney
argues that “ways of thinking digitally about information were embedded
in lesbian-feminist work with paper, in the ways lesbian feminists
learned computing and imagined and built networks and databases for
storing and sharing information” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020">(McKinney

digital networks seen during protests like Arab Spring, as well as in
the continued use of analog zines to discuss technological objects like
machine learning (in the Intersectional AI Toolkit or in Elvia
Vasconcelos’s “A Visual Introduction to AI” <span class="citation"

<p>Zine publisher, activist, and artist Be Oakley says that part of the
appeal of the zine is that the zine form allows for more egalitarian
access across economic boundaries: “A zine is made to be disseminated to
publics otherwise forgotten by hardcover books. […] Class is built into
its format. A zine communicates a level of accessibility through its
materials and its form. […] A zine evokes a legacy of authorship that is

<p>Providing more access can also enable more nuanced access, by setting
access boundaries. Take for example the work of Local Contexts, who help
Indigenous communities protect their data rights by creating tools to
inform researchers of their boundaries. They offer data labels that help
researchers understand how data are meant to be used (and not used)
according to more granular criteria. Rather than using a simple license
agreement, which does not address their needs, Indigenous communities
can reinforce their rights by applying “Traditional Knowledge” and
“Biocultural” labels to data and collections, which provide context,
provenance, metadata, protocols, and permissions for use. These include
designating specific community members or times of year for access, or
designating materials as sacred to the community or open for
collaboration. Local Contexts also provides notices for researchers and
institutions to contextualize their collections with labels like
“Authorization,” “Belonging,” “Caring,” “Gender Aware,” “Leave
Undisturbed,” and others <span class="citation"
data-cites="LocalContextsGrounding">(<span>“Local Contexts – Grounding
Indigenous Rights”</span> n.d.)</span>. The expansiveness of the forms
that a Craft lens can take means that more communities can participate,
but more importantly more communities can participate by creating their
own terms and contexts for participation.</p>

<p>Technology, as reframed through intersectional and craft lenses, is
is always contingent and contextual. <em>TechnoCraft</em> honors
historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft — which
emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community — and aligns them
with the aspects of technology which frequently get overlooked: namely,
the contributions to the materiality of tech from the global majority
and Women of Color.</p>

<p>TechnoCraft attends to the counterhistories still alive in our
present technologies and potentially reemerging in many futures. These
include Hilda G. Carpenter, a Black lab technican whose “core rope
memory” techniques advanced computing and supported the Apollo moon
landings, by physically encoding information using copper wire and
rings. Author Zainab Aliyu compares Carpenter’s physical memory-weaving
processes to the Yoruban oracle system called Ifá, which also uses
binary encoding and draws on “collective memory” for divination<span

interface (GUI) as a turning point in the history of computing, at which
point screens changed from black to white. This was when the “user” was
defined for the stated purpose of easing use, but this also narrowed and
limited use, enacting white supremacist values: “Blackness has, so to
say, formed the ground for white, with black gooey being antithetical to
the values of the white screen” <span class="citation"
data-cites="artistBlackGooeyUniverse">(Artist n.d.)</span>. Those with
more power have frequently appropriated knowledge or extracted labor and
resources to develop technologies, such as the recruitment of Navajo
women to ‘weave’ circuit boards for IBM <span class="citation"
data-cites="nakamuraIndigenousCircuitsNavajo2014">(Nakamura

technology that connect to craft, to ritual, to community in order to —

<p>These entanglements wind through material and conceptual spheres,
which micha cárdenas demonstrates with her description of the stitch as
emblematic of lived intersectional feminist work and of all practices of
craft and technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As sewing is a technique of making that has been used primarily by
women throughout history, and continues to be primarily the task of
women in sweatshops in the global South, […] the stitch as a material
and conceptual operation can be seen as feminist, a way of generating
new concepts by learning from people who have been subject to material
inequalities because of their gender, their race, and their geographic
location. The stitch can be thought of as the basis for a theory of
feminist making, which values the forms of knowledge practiced daily by
oppressed people as they make their lives in the face of violence.”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="cardenasTransColorPoetics2016">(cárdenas 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Technocraft</em> expands the definition of what “counts” as
creating or participating in technology, including what labor is valued
in the accounting of it. It destabilizes static ideas of technologies
and their outputs as infallable and handed-down, by reminding us they
are in fact crafted by people and contingent on contexts. The invisible
labor of data creation and data maintenance is no different from the
invisible labor of infrastructure in this way. Yanni Loukissas argues
for the inherently “local” nature of data, saying that “data-driven
systems […] are locally contingent and even fragile. Designs dependent
on data must be maintained and repaired on a regular basis to ensure
that they are in sync with changes in the data themselves or the
encompassing infrastructure of the place. […] When data do seem to
confer transparency, it is because we are shielded from important
details about the context of their creation or display” <span
class="citation" data-cites="loukissasAllDataAre2019">(Loukissas
2019)</span>. Loukissas suggests the term “data settings” instead of
“data sets” to emphasize the ways data are always shaped by both their
creation and their use. He argues for remembering how data always index
something else and are themselves incomplete. This destabilization of
data helps to recall their human impacts, and it asks us to care for
them responsibly within their shifting contexts as part of various
communities and legacies.</p>
</section>
<section id="reentangled-theory-and-practice" class="level4">
<h4>Reentangled theory and practice</h4>
<p>Practice and theory are tangibly intertwined in craft as TechnoCraft.
While craft is not the only domain where theory and practice merge, it
is useful to draw on craft metaphorically and literally of how it merges
the two accessibly while reaching across domains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The protocols of knitting are thus situated <em>in-between</em> the
looped thread, in the loops themselves. This interconnection protocol of
the thread could be seen as a catalyst, as it produces a bigger whole
from the single thread. […] One could say that the protocol of the
looped thread ‘echoes’ throughout the final knitted piece as the
catalyst produces the conditions for emergent behavior (the inter-loops
of the thread).” <span class="citation"
data-cites="vonbuschZenAbstractMachine2013">(Von Busch 2013)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft shows — through maker processes — how doing becomes being and
being becomes doing. It may seem too simple but it is important: As
actions of making yield creations, craft reemphasizes the making
alongside objects made. It shows how theories of objects (be they media,
tech, or craft objects) emerge from and are embedded in the actions that
produce them. Attending to craft as process — and to technology as its
processes, its people, its protocols — expands beyond the crafting of
objects to include communities of practice and sociotechnical systems:
“as in crafting an identity, or crafting a community” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="fountainSurvivalKnittestCraft2021">(Fountain
2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Craft is also means of thought. Textile designer Nithikul Nimkulrat
describes craft, “not only as a way of making things by hand, but also
as a way of thinking through the hand manipulating a material.” She
suggests that in craft, thinking is a sensory act, inextricable from
doing. “Knowledge of a creative practice thus lies in and can be
acquired from within the practice itself. In other words, thinking and
knowing are inseparable from making in any craft or designerly
practices.” This makes it imbued with responsibility to ourselves and
each other.</p>
<p>These are not metaphors only. They are material, infrastructural
systems that undergird and uphold power — woven into the warp and weft
of all processes. With fiber art this is literal, and it demonstrates
concretely the ways these processes operate in other mediums too.
Cyberfeminist Sadie Plant says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Garments] process and store data. Because there is no difference
between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as
records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women
worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The
visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the
program and the pattern are continuous.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="plantZerosOnes1998">(Plant 1998)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoes of this concept can be seen in current research methods like
Critical Code Studies, an approach to reading code that situates it
within its material, cultural contexts rather than viewing it as a
neutral static object <span class="citation"
data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020a">(Marino 2020)</span>.
Through such material reckonings, we can not only use different lenses
to reflect on existing technologies but also gain the means to reimagine
them for different purposes. As queer craft art historian Daniel
Fountain says, “craft, or more broadly the notion of crafting, is an
essential strategy for living and loving ‘otherwise’” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="fountainSurvivalKnittestCraft2021">(Fountain 2021)</span>.
What does this ‘otherwise’ look like and how does it come about?</p>
<p>Artist-researchers Ren Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard call for
“queer playfulness and promiscuous metaphorical practice” that can
expand beyond passive strategies for remaking technoscience, reusing its
terms in order to imagine new forms: “as a speculative practice of
working with metaphor, we propose to replace CS (Computer Science) with
CS (Careful Slugs), forthcoming could be CS (Cushions and Stargazing),
CS (Crying Sabotage), and/or CS (Chancer Scientist). We propose that the
metaphors of Careful Slugs might create possibilities for new kinds of
work in Computer Science. Possibilities in which unknowing itself become
disoriented, disassembled, and undone in its conventional forms.” They
suggest that metaphor can be a powerful tool for finding gaps and
expanding cracks in violent structures, and that metaphor works in
concert with not in lieu of material practices, to restructure physical
systems. “Through working with metaphor, we generate a series of
speculative fictions for CS––Careful Slugs stories that reconfigure
relations and introduce scandals and chances into Computer Science,
Design, and STS processes that might lead to other sorts of project
plans, research questions, and technical inquiries”<span

<h4>Refusal &amp; material resistance</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Make technology ridiculous.” &gt;–Nam June Paik, <em>We Are in Open
Circuits</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>TechnoCraft can emphasize the “NO” in technology as a resistance or
refusal to operate by the terms and conditions of technology as it has
been handed down: inaccessible, obtuse, large-scale, platformatized,
proprietary, profit-seeking, and so on. Technological tools need not be
the purview of only the narrow band of [users/creators/?] with the most
access, and ‘craftiness’ is both an intellectual and a material strategy
in response. Although craft approaches are also applied in other
contexts, when they are used as methods for refusal they also can become
forms of “tactical media.”</p>
<p>Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse, reimagine
their materials to engage political potentials. As “an investment in a
multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions,”
says Rita Raley, “tactical media activities provide models of opposition
rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau
reminds us, ‘itself remains intact’.” The technological gestures of
tactical media artworks operate in the world as it is now, while
reflecting upon, resisting, and offering alternatives to it. Raley says
that tactica media is a “mutable category” that includes “practices such
as reverse engineering, hacktivism, […] the digital hijack, […]
collaborative software, and open-access technology labs […]” <span
class="citation" data-cites="raleyTacticalMedia2009">(Raley
2009)</span>. In its many forms, tactical media [(like craft)] consists
not only of its material objects, but also its communities, networks,
protocols, and processes of disturbance and resistance.</p>
<p>Crafters and other artists know that resistance can emerge from the
properties of the materials themselves, and that creation is a
cooperative effort between maker and material. Digital humanities
researcher Bethany Nowviskie argues that this resistance is a reminder
of “the material nature of every generative or transformative textual
process” most useful when makers have deep knowledge of their
environment, including the time and access allows them to make and
refine their own tools: “the material nature of every generative or
transformative textual process” <span class="citation"
data-cites="nowviskieResistanceMaterials2013">(Nowviskie
2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Queer use is a form of resistance, both material resistance and
cultural resistance. It can be a way of ‘living otherwise’ and might be
read in some cases as a form of tactical media. Feminist writer Sara
Ahmed describes queer use as both a refusal of normative use and an
embrace of the unused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To queer use is to linger on the material qualities of that which
you are supposed to pass over; it is to recover a potential from
materials that have been left behind, all the things you can do with
paper if you refuse the instructions. That recovery can be dangerous.
The creativity of queer use becomes an act of destruction, whether
intended or not; not digesting something, spitting it out; putting it
about.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmedQueerUse2018">(Ahmed
2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ahmed’s reading, normative use and resistance has much to do with
fit and form: “I think of an institution as an old garment: it has
acquired the shape of those who tend to wear it such that it is easier
to wear if you have that shape. And this is why I think of privilege as
an energy saving device; less effort is required to pass through when a
world has been assembled around you” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ahmedQueerUse2018">(Ahmed 2018)</span>. In a machine
learning parlance, we might say that infrastructures and institutions
are overfitting for select populations — not only overrepresenting them
but designed to suit them — while unable to account for others. With the
capacity to craft our own garments, technologies, systems, institutions,
we can create new fits.</p>

<p>Let’s briefly discuss some techniques employed in craftiness as
refusal and resistance: adversarial use, extreme use, handcraft
practices, and esoteric/DIY systems. These techniques often overlap,
reflect one another, or are used in tandem. Of course they are not the
only techniques, but a few I have spotted in the wild and have used
myself.</p>
<p><strong>Adversarial use</strong> uses technology against the grain or
against the goals of its creators. In <a
href="https://www.jamesbridle.com/works/autonomous-trap-001">“Autonomous
Trap 001”</a>, James Bridle used a salt circle drawn in the pattern of
highway lines to trap a self-driving car in one spot, nodding to ritual
magic while showing the ease with which ‘smart’ systems could be fooled
<span class="citation" data-cites="bridleAutonomousTrap001">(Bridle,
n.d.)</span>. In an obfuscation technique called ‘baysean flooding’,
machine-reading platforms are prevented from interpreting data by mixing
in an overwhelming amount of false data which cannot be distinguished
from ‘true’ data — such as posting a thousand nonsense social media
posts with false locations for every accurate one <span class="citation"
data-cites="bruntonObfuscationUserGuide2015">(Brunton and Nissenbaum
2015)</span>. In <a href="(https://sarahciston.com/lm)">“ladymouth”</a>,
I created a bot to participate in misogynist online forums in order to
post feminist texts, then collected the responses from forum
participants and performed these responses at poetry readings. Both are
examples of adversarial use <span class="citation"
data-cites="cistonLadymouthAntiSocialMediaArt2019">(Ciston
2019a)</span>. Other forms might also include desire lines, the
non-designated paths in parks and natural spaces that are created by
human or animal use.</p>
<p><strong>Extreme use</strong>, also known as breaking, looks to what
is already broken, concerning, or confusing in existing systems and
plunges into those gulfs. By highlighting (or causing) errors and
glitches, these works step into the trouble. They hyperbolize aspects of
a system in order to attend to the problems this exposes. In her
“Manifesto of the Broken Machine,” Sarah Sharma shows how we might work
<em>with</em> outliers and errors — and with perceptions of women and
others as outliers and errors — in order to work <em>against</em> the
systems that frame them as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the idea of our contemporary social-political-economic system as an
already-broken machine full of the incompatibly queer, raced, classed,
and sexed broken-down machines is politically exciting for feminism. […]
A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the
machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to
pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves.”

<p><strong>Handcraft practices</strong> may involve craft tools or may

data-cites="EGP">(<span>“EGP”</span> n.d.)</span>. In <a
href="https://sarahciston.com/anarchies.html">“No Knots, Only

sculpture. The work offers a tangible means to grappled with the uncanny
scale of large language models, by comparing the number of stitches in a
huge sculpture to the number of parameters in a model (finding them
still insufficient to “model” the model).</p>
<p><strong>Esoteric systems</strong>, or DIY systems, are often a
response from artists or communities when they cannot find the tools or
resources they need in existing forms or formats. Creating their own
alternatives in response to the lack they perceive, artists’ esoteric
systems can be inventive and generative, investigative and critical, or
justice-seeking and recooperative, among other things. In <a
href="https://kayserifserif.place/work/coem/">“Coem”</a>, Katherine Yang
created an esoteric programming language that “imagines poetry as
purposeful and code as emotional,” working against general-purpose
languages that prioritize efficiency over feeling. Developing a language
with different core values demonstrates how value systems drive code
design and inform the functions a language allows as well as what
operations and outputs it can produce <span class="citation"

href="https://paglen.studio/2020/04/29/imagenet-roulette/">“ImageNet

exploring a popular dataset used in many machine learning foundation
models, in order to reveal the dataset’s problematic taxonomies that
classified people as, for example, “slattern, slut, slovenly woman,
trollop” or “failure, loser, non-starter, unsuccessful person” <span
class="citation" data-cites="crawfordExcavatingAIPolitics2019">(Crawford
and Paglen 2019)</span>. By building a system that let public audiences
explore the dataset in an accessible way, they could bring personal
understanding to the issues with how such datasets are created and used
in many kinds of machine learning tasks. In my upcoming research project
<a href="https://unsupervisedpleasures">“Unsupervised Pleasures”</a>,
developed in collaboration with Emily Martinez, we are developing
alternative approaches to conscientious dataset development based on
intersectional principles and practices, in hopes that these shift the
outputs when applied to language models (and as a provocation for
imagining different model architectures as well).</p>
<p>These forms of refusal replace what they reject with alterative
visions for more liberatory technologies. Creative and social computing
scholar and activist Dan McQuillan argues current AI systems exacerbates
existing aspects of society that act violently to exclude and enclose.
He calls for an anti-facist approach to AI that can
[enact/enforce/instantiate] “a positive refusal, a rejection of certain
forms of apparatus and a commitment to radical alternatives. […] Our
ambition should stretch beyond the timid idea of AI governance, which
accepts what we’re already being subjected to, and instead look to
transform our apparatuses into a technical practice that supports the
common good” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist">(McQuillan n.d.)</span>. We
can start with looking at how existing models, methods, and
methodologies indicate the changes that need to be made, not in the
models alone but in the world, argues digital democracy scholar Wendy H.
K. Chun: “Machine learning and predictive models as they currently exist
can also resist reduction, but only if we treat the gaps between their
results and our realties as spaces for political action, not errors to
be fixed. [We need to treat these models as we do global climate change
models. GCC models offer us the most probable future, given past
actions, not so that we accept that future, but so we work to change it.
Only global climate change deniers seek to fix the model, rather than
the world.]” <span class="citation"
data-cites="chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021">(Chun 2021)</span>.
As Chun and McQuillan suggest, we need more than the mere governance of
emerging technologies as they are currently conceived, and instead
require moves towards prefigurative practices. Crafty tactical media can
queer the use of machine learning systems and other emergent
technologies in order to reveal their classificatory, reductionist
logics. By applying techniques like aversarial use, extreme use,
handcraft practices, and esoteric systems, a TechnoCraft lens helps
imagine and enact “a committment to radical alternatives.” As
TechnoCraft suggests, such alternatives already exist, if we are willing
to write, build, create, and cooperate in ways that reveal them and
allow them to flourish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Embracing the nuances of crafted art forms […] exemplifies the
non-linear, embodied, diffractive ways of reading, interpreting, and
understanding the world while questioning what AI tools can do and the
extent to which craftspeople have a say in what AI tools should be doing
instead. I contend that AI does not produce newness but rather ‘newly’
suggests how craftspeople have always been creative agents for shaping
the future of culturally and visually-informed algorithmic systems.”

<h3>CRAFT: <em>Coding.Care: Field Notes for Making Friends with
Code</em></h3>
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->
<p><em>Coding.Care</em> is a pocket guide to sustaining friendly coding
communities — why we need them, how to build them, how to let them
thrive. It focuses on lessons I learned from Code Collective, the
diverse hack lab that I started in 2019 when I yearned for the
adaptable, encouraging environment I had needed when I was first
struggling to learn to program. In gratitude to teachers like Brett
Stalbaum, at UC San Diego’s Computing in the Arts program, who had
showed me code could feel creative instead of prescriptive, I wanted to
make a space where I wouldn’t feel like an outsider for ‘not knowing
everything’ about programming, and I suspected others might feel the
same.I wondered how to recreate that experience.</p>
<p>In Code Collective, a mix of media artists, activists, makers,
scientists, scholars, and engineers gather to co-work and co-learn,
thinking critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space
that supports many kinds of learners. The Collective unites students who
may have zero technical experience with those who may have lots of
technical experience but perhaps lack a critical or creative lens; and
we value their experiences equally, reinforcing the idea: <strong>“We
all have something to teach each other.”</strong></p>
<p>This guide looks at a variety of the strategies and tools we have
explored and developed as we have grown. It discusses how we have
adapted to meet the needs of our community — from hosted workshops to
hybrid-format meetups, from pandemic support to alumni programming. Code
Collective’s approaches draw on many existing methodologies and methods
from intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist
theories. The guide connects these approaches to cooperative
organizations Varia and p5.js, and to Critical Code Studies and to
TechnoCraft practices like working iteratively and breaking
critically.</p>
<p>As a guide for making friends with code, <em>Coding.Care</em>
discusses how practices such as process-oriented skillbuilding,
co-teaching and co-learning, and snacks (always snacks) embody the
Collective’s guiding values, such as <strong>“scrappy artistic
strategies not perfect code.”</strong> The guide shares projects and
feedback from members of the Collective, who report how these values and
practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally,
I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my own
research, above and beyond my role as facilitator. Code Collective has
become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my
practice. The guide offers practical advice for getting comfortable with
code, while situating these approaches and groups within an
<strong>ethics of coding care</strong> — grounded in shared embodied
knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community
— as an antidote to technocratic values and as an enactment of
Trans*formative Technocraft.</p>
<p>In her book, <em>Coding Literacy</em>, Annette Vee argues that,
“Changing ‘how the system works’ would move beyond material access to
education and into a critical examination of the values and ideologies
embedded in that education. […] Programming is a literacy practice with
many applications beyond a profession defined by a limited set of
values” <span class="citation"
data-cites="veeCodingLiteracyHow2017">(Vee 2017)</span>. Vee calls this
kind of programming access “transformative.” Through
<em>Coding.Care</em>’s intimidation-free, learner-led, process-oriented
approaches, it both theorizes and models the creation of caring
communities and innovative spaces that can transfer knowledge across
social strata and intellectual disciplines in order to reshape
technological systems.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Through <em>Coding.Care</em>, understand how to approach

<h3>FORMATIVE: <em>A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine
Learning Datasets</em> and <em>Inclusive Datasets Research
Guide</em></h3>
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->
<p>Datasets provide the foundation for all of the large-scale machine
learning systems we encounter today, and they are increasingly part of
many other research fields and daily life. Many technical guides exist
for learning to work with datasets, and much scholarship has emerged to
study datasets critically <span class="citation"
data-cites="corryCriticalDatasetStudies gillespieCriticalAlgorithmStudies2015">(Corry
et al., n.d.; Gillespie and Seaver 2015)</span>. Yet no guides attempt
to combine technical and critical approaches comprehensively. Every
dataset is partial, imperfect, and historically and socially contingent
— yet the abundance of [problematic datasets and models] shows how
little attention is given to these critical concerns in typical use.</p>
<p><em>A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning
Datasets</em> helps navigate the complexity of working with giant
datasets. Its accessible tone and zero assumed knowledge support direct
use by practitioners of all stripes — activists, artists, journalists,
scholars, students — anyone who is interacting with datasets in the wild
and wants to use them in their work, while being mindful of their
impacts. Developed with Kate Crawford and Mike Ananny, as part of their
research team Knowing Machines, the field guide discusses parts and
types of datasets, how they are transformed, why bias cannot be
eliminated, and questions to ask at every stage of the dataset
lifecycle. Importantly, it shares benefits of working critically with
datasets when (on the surface) it may seem just as easy not to.</p>
<p>The <em>Inclusive Datasets Research Guide</em> is an interactive
digital guide for academic researchers working with datasets, that
supports them with an overview of key concepts and considerations for
working with datasets, as well as providing tools and software, books
and tutorials, and recommendations for thinking inclusively. Like the
Critical Field Guide, the Inclusive Datasets Research Guide focuses on a
blend of technical and critical decisions that arise when working with
datasets. Because this guide is aimed at students and teachers, the
format is brief collections of resources rather than conceptual
deep-dives. The guide appears on the USC Libraries’ website along with
its other research guides on many topics.</p>
<p>Developed by a team at USC Libraries, with the support of a grant
from the USC Office of Research, this research guide was written as part
of a grant to acquire core research datasets to support areas of inquiry
by USC researchers into arts, humanities, and machine learning. I was
recruited to provide interdisciplinary perspective on inclusive
approaches to machine learning, and I joined a team including a chief
library technologist, data science graduate students, special
collections librarians, a research communications specialist, and a
multimedia digital humanities specialist. We conducted 18 interviews
with faculty across campus who worked with datasets in order to develop
an internal rubric to support collection development. Through this
process, we found that the need was less for dataset acquisition,
because researchers did not look to libraries for their datasets but of
course had access to many elsewhere. Still, the rubric we developed was
utilized to acquire approximately 50 collections identified for being
more accessible, inclusive, ‘datafiable’, and meaningfully engaged.
Instead, we found the need existed for more curated resources and more
training on how to select and use datasets critically, while remaining
mindful of their origins and impacts — which led to the expanded aim of
the grant and the development of the <em>Inclusive Datasets Research
Guide</em></p>
<p>Both the Critical Field Guide and the Inclusive Datasets Research
Guide reflect on the stakes of datasets and the human choices they
relies on. Reframing the information in two different forms shows that
it can be more effective in different contexts, depending on the
audiences and the rhetorical tone they require. Both works are examples
of how concepts and processes researched in the <em>Intersectional AI
Toolkit</em> (below) can be reworked for new institutional contexts.
Adapting the Toolkit to new audiences in library science, data science,
and the social sciences posed interesting challenges that both expanded
and refined the work. It required the ideas be scaled up and applied,
and sometimes renegotiated until their rewordings no longer felt like
watering down. So much of [the work] I am still learning, is about
[people where they are][which means remembering that I have as much or
more to learn from others than the other way around.] In each project, I
got to learn how another field has addressed the problems of knowledge
organization and bias, historically and in the present. Library
scientists, of course, have at least a century of practice considering
questions of how to categorize, curate, and archive. Social scientists
have been asking how and what to measure for just as long. None of this
is perfect, either, but learning from each institution, and combining
thse with what machine learning is trying to ask, helps me understand
better how we got where we are today. Combining these with what other
intersectional practices may already understand helps me understand
better what each domain might learn from the other.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Through the <em>Critical Field Guide for Working with
Machine Learning Datasets</em> and the <em>Inclusive Datasets Research
Guide</em>, understand the importance of working critically with
datasets as part of any machine learning practice. Identify the parts,
types, and functions of datasets as you encounter them. Determine
whether a particular dataset is a good fit for your project by asking
understanding critical questions to ask at each phase of the dataset
lifecycle. [Work with the communities impacted by your research to
create strategies for addressing potential harms in the datasets you
utilize.]</p>

<p>Michel de Montaigne called the essay form a ‘trial’ or ‘attempt’.
These interstitial essays are attempts to speak in the nearbyness of
<em>Trans*formative TechnoCraft</em>. They are trials, in the sense of
struggles, to get closer to the core of the creature by sneaking between
its ribs. An oblique strategy, they glance against logical modes of
critical analysis or direct address, in order to become the [thing] and
probe the [thing] and interrupt the [thing] [simultaneously].</p>
<p>As an alternate take on “bias” (because bias cannot be “optimized”
out of systems), these are bias cuts moving diagonally or diffractively
across the warp and weft of the fabric of the other texts here. Cutting
and sewing on the bias puts fabric in tension, making garments that take
the shape of the bodies they surround. Bias cuts are ways of working
with and against materials, acknowledging their limits and not resolving
them to right angles. Thus, these essays sustain the research tensions
of <em>Trans*formative TechnoCraft</em>, unfurling the questions in the
materials rather than folding them away.</p>
<p>Locating (and writing in) “a correspondence, not an assemblage,” the
essays join together by “living with” concepts <span class="citation"
data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold 2015)</span>. They are portals
to a co-existing “past-present-future” <span class="citation"
data-cites="olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021">(Olufemi
2021)</span> for exploring our relationships with systems differently
and intimately, in which “the past is not lost, however, but rather a
space of potential” <span class="citation"
data-cites="chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021">(Chun 2021)</span>.
[This is the threading together of nearbyness.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the future is not in front of us, it is everywhere simultaneously:
multidirectional, variant, spontaneous. We only have to <em>turn
around</em>. Relational solidarities, even in their failure, reveal the
plurality of the future-present, help us to see through the impasse,
help temporarily eschew what is stagnant, help build and then prepare to
shatter the many windows of the here and now.” <span class="citation"

<!-- >"The imagination is central to the cultural production of revolutionary movements; its primary role is to signal *what could be. What could be* is a lingistic stand-in for a set of political, social and cultural demands, strategic aims, revolutionary longings. As such, it resists singular definition."[@olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021]   --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of locating correspondences, the essays also use
correspondance as a form, relying on epistolary address to conjure up
analogue antecedents to the digital media discussed in other sections of
<em>Trans*formative TechnoCraft</em>. I read the works of several 20th
century media artists as pre-responses to automated systems. Their wide
range of practices — from minimalist daily rituals to queer feminist
body art and performance — show how we have always—already been living
in, talking about, performing with the questions amplified by automated
systems, classification, and datification. Their works offer a breadth
of artistic possibilities for reconsidering our relationships with
computational systems — and these responses were already being
established in parallel to the development of those systems. They help
me reimagine how I want to respond now.</p>
<p>The essay form is a kind of embodied processing that moves the
[corpus through the corpus], a reckoning in throat and gut that pairs
bodily processing with computational processing. These interstitial
essays serve, as queer scholar KJ Cerankowski writes, “to let this book
be the crisis rather than about the crisis or crises, rather, a
plurality of traumas and pains felt collectively and individually” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="cerankowskiSutureTraumaTrans2021">(Cerankowski 2021)</span>.
Long traditions of artistic and literary outliers have maintained the
need for such forms, like autotheory and lyric essay, which bridge
aesthetic, personal, and political concerns. From these traditions, I am
interested both in the constitutive act of form-making (as
prefiguration) and in the reconsitituion of critical forms into poetic,
personalized, or approachable forms <span class="citation"

<h3>TECH: <em>The Intersectional AI Toolkit</em></h3>
<!-- {: .no_toc } -->
<p>The <em>Intersectional AI Toolkit</em> argues that anyone should be
able to understand AI and help shape its futures. Through collaborative
sine-making workshops, it aims to find common vocabularies to connect
diverse communities around AI’s urgent questions. It clarifies, without
math or jargon, the inner workings of AI systems and the ways in which
they operate always as sociotechnical systems. The Toolkit celebrates
intersectional work done by many other researchers and artists working
to address these issues in interdisciplinary fields; and it gathers and
synthesizes legacies of anti-racist, queer, transfeminist, neurodiverse,
anti-ableist theories, ethics, and tactics that can contribute valuable
perspective. Its three formats allow for multiple entry points: The
digital wiki offers a forum for others to discuss and expand upon its
topics. The collection of printed zines share AI topics at a concise,
approachable scale. And the in-person and hybrid-online workshops invite
multiple communities to participate directly in the systems that impact
them.</p>
<p>As Trans*formative TechnoCraft, the format of the toolkit was highly
considered as part of the process of developing the <em>Intersectional
AI Toolkit</em>. The toolkit form taken up here was first modeled after
Ahmed’s ‘Killjoy Survival Kit’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="ahmedLivingFeministLife2017">(Ahmed 2017)</span>.<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>. The term ‘toolkit’ was thoroughly
contested — too instrumental and object-oriented — but settled upon
after nothing else quite suited. Not compendium or catalogue or care
package, not index or hub or gazetteer, not manifesto or knapsack or
portal. The technologies used went through many iterations, from git
repo to wiki to self-hosted hybrid back to repo again, in search of a
platform that would facilitate guest user access without heavy
onboarding, track edits, and adapt to multimedia zine forms. I am still
remaking the work and searching for the perfect form. I suspect I will
have to create it, and it will continue to change. In its various
iterations, the Toolkit has grown into eleven zine-making workshops,
compiled into eight printed zines, plus [xxx][eight][online topic
pages]. Work on the Toolkit also resulted in the two related datasets
projects, which reflected back to inform the Toolkit. Citizen data
researcher Jennifer Gabrys says toolkits “provide instructions not just
for assembly and use but also for attending to the social and political
ramifications of digital devices.” She says they are spaces of
“instruction, contingency, action, and alternative engagement” <span
class="citation" data-cites="gabrysHowThingsSensors2019">(Gabrys
2019)</span>. As such, the <em>Intersectional AI Toolkit</em> hopes to
provide resources and access points for engaging differently with
machine learning systems in non-intimidating ways that connect different
audiences.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Through the Intersectional AI Toolkit, the need for
plural perspectives on AI systems. Understand key terminology related to
machine learning and to intersectionality. Share perspectives on the
impact of emerging technology as it relates to you. Choose critically
which AI tools and resources you will engage and how.</p>

<h3>Similarity &amp; nearness</h3>
<p>The * emphasizes an unspoken interstitial — interjection,
interruption, insertion, interpolation — this work happening in between
and nearby, underneath and overhead and throughout. In digital contexts
this may be called <a
href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp"><code>lerp</code></a> (short
for ‘linear interpolation’ and much more fun to say) or <a
href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-frame-animations.html"><code>tween</code></a>

href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> or smoothing. These methods of
interpolation are methods of creating or locating nearness and of
smoothing the rough journey between. To <code>interpolate</code> in math
is to create new knowledge (datapoints) based on existing knowledge
(datapoints), or to estimate value at a position based on values from
nearby positions.</p>
<p>But I always mix up the terms <code>interpolate</code> and
<code>interpellate</code>. To <code>interpellate</code> is to interrupt
or intercede (again like interstitial) or to summon, cite, call out.
Shall I interpolate the distance between <code>interpolate</code> and
<code>interpellate</code>? Political philosopher Frantz Fanon describes
being called out as a racialized body and witnessing himself as another
person’s brutal interpretation <span class="citation"
data-cites="fanonBlackSkinWhite1967">(Fanon 1967)</span>. Marxist
philosopher Louis Althusser describes being hailed by a representative
of the State apparatus and understanding it is himself who is meant
<span class="citation"
data-cites="althusserIdeologyIdeologicalState1970">(Althusser
1970)</span>. Both these interpellations are about being seen, about the
necessity of submitting to this seeing, about shame. These
interpellations are also crossing a distance, creating a nearness,
pulling close under duress. This distance is a street or sidewalk, and
it is also the conceptual distance between how someone else understands
us and how we wish to be known.</p>
<p>Interpolation divides up distance, quantifies it, makes it possible
to cross (it leaps Zeno’s paradox with stepping stones). Interpolation
makes interpellation possible in computational regimes, because it helps
map (define) an individual, through generalization. It pins one down to
classificatory schemas (created from collections of other interpellated
individuals). [These are weak-star topologies.] Computationally,
proximity helps us jump to conclusions about each other:</p>

precondition of not only computing but also […] of modern disciplinary

</blockquote>
<p>All this reduces to nearness and distance. how similarity and
difference are mapped onto nearness and distance. What if the polarities
were reversed — nearness and difference, similarity and distance? What
if different values took priority instead of only matching like with
like? How about all other intuitions that bring us together, including
but not only what make us the same? What activation functions might
activate other intuitions, or tamper with expectations, beyond or

<h3>Nearbyness</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“not to speak about but rather to speak nearby” <span
class="citation" data-cites="chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992">(Chen
1992)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to write a theory of nearbyness (near-bi-ness) that is not a
theory of nearness. Not nearness as measures and scores, not proximity
and similarity, not K-means and K-nearest-neighbors. Filmmaker Trinh T.
Minh Ha describes ‘speaking nearby’ as “a speaking that does not
objectify, does not point to an object as if it is distant from the
speaking subject or absent from the speaking place. A speaking that
reflects on itself and can come very close to a subject without,
however, seizing or claiming it” <span class="citation"
data-cites="chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992">(Chen 1992)</span>. This
is <code>nearbyness</code> as a practice of attending-to, not
<code>nearness</code> as the foundation for assumption-making. Through
what it places in conversation, in contact, in texture, in tension,
nearbyness enacts via poetic logics and “forms of indirectness” that,
and how, and why its elements require each other. Nearbyness prefigures
the more-than which this closeness creates. This is a trans*disciplinary
practice, as more than the sum of its combined fields or niches, and it
is a trans*formative practice too.</p>
<p>I want to take up Trinh’s argument — that the nearby “is an attitude
in life, a way of positioning oneself in relation to the world. Thus,
the challenge is to materialize it” <span class="citation"
data-cites="chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992">(Chen 1992)</span> — in
order to suggest that this nearbyness can respond to computational
values of compartmentalizing, modularity, and encapsulation, which silo
off data from the code that operates on it.</p>
<p>These values separate disciplinary discourses from politics and from
each other. They separate for efficiency and understanding, security and
containment. As [XXX-ID] Tara McPherson says, computation’s modular
values emerged simultaneously with and in response to the civil rights
movement in the US: “the very structures of digital computation
correspond to larger cultural shifts that seek to cordon off race and to
contain it” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018">(2018)</span>. McPherson’s
metaphor of “lenticular” postcards, which show two separate images when
viewed from different angles, demonstrate how modularity allows for
invisibility, despite proximity. She argues that lenticular perspectives
position “our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating
on sameness or difference while forestalling connection and
interrelation. […] A lenticular logic is a logic of the fragment or the
chunk, a way of seeing the world as discrete modules or levels, a mode
that suppresses relation and context.” From object-oriented programming
to object-oriented ontology, from global supply chains to machine
learning architectures, such projects deny their entanglements. They
reduce these entanglements to magnitudes of distance in vector
dimensions.</p>
<p>Even “meaning” in language has become increasingly defined by these
numerical representations of proximity. Through natural language
processing, nearness becomes co-occurance becomes word vector becomes
fact and prediction. The [modus operandi/battle cry] of predictive
language systems, underlying tools like AdSense and GhatGPT, is a 1957
quip from linguist JR Firth: “the meaning of a word can be inferred by
the company it keeps” <span class="citation"
data-cites="firthApplicationsGeneralLinguistics1957">(Firth
1957)</span>.</p>
<p><code>Nearbyness</code> resists this denial of complex entanglements
by reuniting them in conversation, bringing close without collapsing
distinctions. It is a different way of placing side by side, making note
of more than frequency and sameness, with the aim to replace
knowing-as-conquering with other kinds of understanding: frisson, spark,
and activation; disparity, tension, and curiosity; cooperation and
commitment, for example. [XXX-ID] Romi Morrison’s work on flesh and
unknowability describes alternative ways of knowing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“leaving open the unresolved space of coming to know something that
is relational: taking into consideration the specific context of the
speaker, the place from which they speak, the closeness they share, and
the mode through which that speaking happens. To know in this context is
not a territorial claim to be made, enclosed, and defended but an
endured practice of proximity. To speak nearby is a gesture of knowing
that requires engagement, perforating the hermetic encapsulation of
totality.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="morrisonFlesh2021">(Morrison 2021)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Critical theorist Lauren Berlant also details how such relations can
maintain closeness, without capitulating to machine learning’s
reductionism, through the same “non-sovereign” knowing Trihn
describes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The space between and the spaces among involve distances created by
the disturbance of being close without being joined, and without
mistaking the other’s ﬂesh for one’s own or any object world as
identical to oneself. Nonsovereignty is not here the dissolution of a
boundary. It’s the experience of affect, of being receptive, in real
time.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="berlantCommonsInfrastructuresTroubling2016">(Berlant
2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These operations of nearbyness [bring us to form and formative]. The
assembling logic here is of accretion and coalition – an <em>Arcades
Project</em> of wandering, filing, putting like with like, but also
unlike and other aspects together, or at least nearby. It is a machine
learning task, an <code>un-machine un-learning</code> task, to decide
how information goes together or does not, to find patterns in a system.
It is also a very human activity. [This project enacts the process
through intuitive and counter-intuitive feeling [<span class="citation"
data-cites="camptListeningImages2017">Campt
(2017)</span>][weirdpivothere?].] For some, like Vilém Flusser,<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> writing is a sculptor’s cutting
away. For others, like Walter Benjamin, writing is a collector’s fever
dream. I believe it is both, collecting fragments when you cannot yet
see a form, when you cannot do anything else; then cutting away at them
until what has already formed becomes clearer. Anuradha Reddy describes
the process of working with varied materials similarly as a process of
“adjacency”:</p>
<!-- accumulation and cutting away, pattern finding in collections of data, as the reverse proxies for making and testing theories, contraposed knowledge generating systems [Joque, Revolutionary Mathematics] -->
<blockquote>
<p>“The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making
them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for
understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems,
especially when the outcomes deviate from one’s expectations of what the
system can or will do. […] Rather than aiming for generalization,
adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking
unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance
confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways
that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words,
adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from
a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity
practices.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022">(Reddy

</blockquote>
<p>This ability to work with machine learning, or any technology, as a
concrete material — as an artist or craftsperson would — is a way of
moving into curiosity, poetics, aesthetics: nearbyness.</p>

<section id="computing-new-computations" class="level3">
<h3>Computing new computations</h3>
<p>From the works in this collection, I have begun to get an inkling of
a ‘compu-poetics’ of Nearbyness. What would nearbyness ask of
TechnoCraft in order to transform technologies — for example, to move
from foundation models that have been built on narrow slices of data and
classificatory logics, to transformative models that might unravel them?
What does Nearbyness and Trans*formative TechnoCraft ask of me?</p>
<p>At least, at first, to ask better questions, to get my hands dirty,
to get closer. Transformation pulls us up from the roots. What does
trans*formative computing look like? Probably many things, with many
different goals, created specifically by the communities who will use
it. For example, based on knowledge and intelligence that is “not
classificatory but storied,” not totalizing but exploratory <span
class="citation" data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold 2015)</span>,
can we imagine a phenomenological model of language, instead of a
stochastic one <span class="citation"
data-cites="benderDangersStochasticParrots2021">(Bender et al.
2021)</span>? What does it look like to code nearby, to code
relationally?</p>
<p>Through lenses of Trans*formative TechnoCraft we have discussed, I
hope this sounds less far-fetched than before. We know that computation
did not start out binary and does not have to stay that way. Voltage
begins as an analogue signal. Nature’s nonclassificatory logics offer
many other forms of calculation: Soap film computers <span
class="citation" data-cites="SoapFilmAnalogue2017">(<span>“The Soap
Film: An Analogue Computer”</span> 2017)</span>, mushroom computers
<span class="citation" data-cites="maddukuriWhatIfWe2021">(Maddukuri
2021)</span>, slime moulds and liquid state machines <span
class="citation" data-cites="bridleWaysBeingHuman2022">(Bridle
2022)</span> all produce complex, non-binary operations. Artist
Stephanie Dinkins says, “Widely deployed AI can support bottom-up
decision making and provide the public means to directly inform the
systems that govern us while also empowering the governed” <span
class="citation" data-cites="koernerSoftwareArtistsBook2020">(Köerner et
al. 2020)</span>. By rethinking AI and all emergent technologies as

<!-- >If we collectively consider ourselves the liberated byproduct of an algorithmic futurity, radically programmed by our cyborgian ancestors and widely deployed, the answer is simple: us. [Legacy Russell on Stephanie Dinkins and Rashaad Newsome](https://www.shiftspace.pub/cyborgian-shade-legacy-russell) -->
<!-- Refusing how technologies have been posited as serving capitalist goals can mean reorienting toward technologies of sharing. 
~~No to capital and Yes to sharing~~ -->
<!-- TechNO is also open-access, open-source — in their refusal to capitulate to capitalist regimes of encapsulation, privatization, knowledge-hoarding and gatekeeping.  -->
<!-- in IAIT? -->
<!-- Open-source projects are often open in name only. OpenAI is the most prominent example of this, as a company that began creating machine learning models that offered research access but has increasingly become closed and proprietary. Elsewhere, I have written about the gaps in open-source works which do nothing more than place a single version of their source code online — in contrast to robust, responsive open-source projects that develop their work over multiple versions in consultation with their communities. Elea Zhong argues that not only do large corporate entities claiming to be open source often fail to offer substantive contributions to open-source communities, they misuse the term 'open source' to extort free labor.  -->
<!-- >"In the same way big oil brands itself with greenwashing for illusory environmental progressiveness, big tech extol their open source efforts to open-wash their capitalist, monopolistic, and destructive reality. Technological development is in dire need for a policy-first, documentation-first, ideology-first methodology, and AI must transform its focus on creating systems which understands and addresses the complexity of its environment, critically assesses its context, and produces meaning-rich results." (Elea Zhong 2023) -->
<!-- Machine unlearning ([ender 2023](https://www.enderverse.org/notes/unlearning.html)) points out that 
The new task in machine learning called 'machine unlearning' has emerged due to large models' training costs and the practice of indiscrimine data scraping. As Code Collective member ender writes, machine unlearning assumes access to the models it wants to alter, which also assumes a powerful role with agency in big tech. Instead, ender combines questions of machine unlearning with adversarial data poisoning to ask how one can remove data from a model without access to the initial model.  -->

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.

  - >"holds in suspicion the prestige the commons concept has attained in the US and theory-cosmopolitan context, often signifying an ontology that merely needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up to it. Although the commons claim sounds like an uncontestably positive aim, the concept in this context threatens to cover over the very complexity of social jockeying and interdependence it responds to by delivering a conﬁrming aﬀective surplus in advance of the lifeworld it’s also seeking.

#### Key forms & foundational concepts of generative AI systems explained

[see also AI basics FAQ in IAIT]

#### Classification logics

- Pervasive capture, data colonialism: 
  - >"the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction." (Nick Couldry & Ulises A. Mejias  [@couldryMakingDataColonialism2019])
- Garbage in, garbage out: 
  - Conscientious collection methods, values and questions 
  - Proprietary, missing, indecipherable data, practices and documentation
  - Labor:
    - "The data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour" [@ExclusiveHourWorkers]
    - "ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent,” Andrew Strait
    - "Automation runs on the averaged microjudgments of whole detachments of underpaid humans, not some supersmart computer." [Steyerl (2022) @steyerlMeanImages2023]
- Unacknowledged curation: 
  - >"All of these attempts to harmonize and create general descriptive languages are founded on a universalizing logic that in its most utopian dimensions believes that these political and infrastructural differences that stand in the way of classification are accidental and can ultimately be overcome." [Justin Joque (2015) @joqueDataCreationMeaning2015]
- Data bodies, algorithmic race & gender, the problem of representation: 
  - “your algorithmic gender may well contradict your own identity, needs, and values. Google’s gender is a gender of profitable convenience” (John Cheney-Lippold, We Are Data @cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017)
  - whose data are (not) included:
    - "we need to interrogate not only the security of our data but  [...] What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to [a boutique self-tracking device], the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?" (Jacqueline Wernimont, Numbered Lives [@wernimontNumberedLivesLife2018])
    - whose stories are these? "what subject position allows us to ethically occupy, flourish, and move in a world of pervasive data monitoring? (Natasha Dow Schull)
- Worldbuilding with data: 
  - “Database design, in that way, is 'an exercise in worldbuilding,' a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views—a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race.” [@benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019]
- Uncertainty reduced to certainty 
  - >>"If uncertainty is the ability for the unknown to be accounted for by comporting to containment under the logics of algorithmic models, then what can unknowability offer instead? [...]["BLACKNESS as space of ethical absence," "the unknown as a subject"] Unknowability born from the figure of the flesh opens the space for ways of understanding the world that are otherwise discounted because of their inability to be neatly measured and accounted for. It is the place in which irresolution is allowed to reside." (Morrison 2021, 255) >>"flesh becomes an essential outlier from which to assess the limitations of sociotechnical fixes. Flesh is the poignant, unavoidable signifier and text upon which to read the history and reality of total expropriation of value from bodies and land." (255) [@morrisonFlesh2021]
- Displaced agency, diffused responsibility
- Bias transfer:
  - "bias transfer both (a) arises in realistic settings (such as when pre-training on ImageNet or other standard datasets) and (b) can occur even when the target dataset is explicitly de-biased" @salmanWhenDoesBias2022


>"computers were humans (mostly women), and digital computers were primarily used for complex calculations, especially in wartime military contexts. Amid the ballistic calculations, Turing speculated on a prompt from his teacher, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: Can machines think? Both men thought it was a ridiculous question" [@veeTextGenEdTeachingText2023] -->
<!-- In deep interdisciplinary practice in classrooms, necessarily, "the topic of inquiry emerged as primary and our institutionally-created selves emerged as secondary" [@mcclellanDeepInterdisciplinarityCritical2014]

TERM: *Deep Interdisciplinarity* is able to view these fundamental states as hybrid, not only different fields or concepts but the core ways of seeing/being/becoming. The approach of constantly shifting lenses and destabilizing and viewing as spectra. Ontologically interdisciplinary. (not ontology or being but becoming, process philosophy). Bakhtin’s heteroglossia ("another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way" (1934)) and polyphony. But what are the larger interfaces & infrastructures that could enable hybrid language and switching across, that can facilitate expanded ways of thinking?

>"As with chess, knitting starts with the same point of departure, and all games and knits start with the same set-up. But turing the process, even within the limits of rigit protocols, the moves diverge very rapidly [...]. new tactics in chess constantly evolve and every new master beats the previous, not because of superior intelligence, but through the development of new techniques and tactics, actualized within these vast possibilities. Innovation in chess does not happen through conservation, but through constant confrontation and risk-taking." [@vonbuschZenAbstractMachine2013] -->

<!-- >"AI systems, in taking a traditionally gendered approach to knowledge which reflects the style of mainstream epistemology, incorporate a view of the world which tacitly reflects a norm of masculinity, both in terms of the knower and the known.

<li id="fn2" role="doc-endnote"><p>Because generative AI models have
become so large, and training processes so slow and expensive, they
frequently rely on foundation models — previous models, often designed
for other tasks, used as the building block or sourdough starter for new
models. Foundation models carry with them the histories of how their
datasets were designed and for what purpose, whose data was included or
excluded, and the choices their creators made when preprocessing them.
These are often decades-old “benchmarks” leaving debunked or erroneous
information in cutting-edge models’ outputs.<a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3" role="doc-endnote"><p>The phrase “infrastructures of care”
comes from Christina Dunbar-Hester’s <em>Hacking Diversity</em>, in
which she refers specifically to the work done in open-source and hacker
communities to create “more inclusive spaces for women, trans, and
gender non-conforming people.” I use the term “infrastructures of care”
in this work to discuss such communities below, but I also use the term
more broadly to refer to mutual aid and other forms of community in
practice.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn4" role="doc-endnote"><p>Reparative and restorative processing
are part of this work, but the terms ‘reparative’ and ‘restorative’ in
relationship to justice movements and to LGBTQIA+ histories are fraught.
Instead I find the broader sense of ‘transformative’ resonates for me
with trans*, intersectional, and inclusive approaches to identities and

influences, and its intentions].<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn12" role="doc-endnote"><p>Creating classes in object-oriented
programming lets the programmer instantiate each instance of an object
with a pre-determined form, adjustable only within those limits. These
processes indicate what prior schemas you’ll pull from, what parts
you’ll write over, what qualities you’ll predetermine. They indicate
what aspects will be qualities of the entire class, and what qualities
will be specific to each object. They determine what actions each
‘object’ will ‘know’ how to do, and how the programmer or user will
establish and retreive information. There’s a language for all this in
“object-oriented” programming, which requires a different sense of
relationality than “functional” programming.<a href="#fnref12"

<li id="fn13" role="doc-endnote"><p>I dream of a platform where I can
write and code and share and cite and annotate and highlight and collage
and print and remix and machine-read and connect. [In my dream notes, I
have written “semantic web layer cake?” and “Gollum platform?” I rarely
imagine I am the only one imagining such things, until I try to explain
them to others. I expect it to be easy, that these hybrid forms already
exist — becaue they seem so small and obvious to me, how complicated
could they be? But when I try to find some preexisting version, I come
up empty, frustrated, confused. And I am left without tools or language
to begin building such a connected and connecting form on my own.]<a

physical, flexible materials used to create curves between points, used

to bend.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn16" role="doc-endnote"><p>“[Writing] has nothing to do with
constructing. It is, on the contrary, a taking away, a de-structing. It
is, both structurally and historically, closer to sculpture than to
architecture. It is a gesture of making holes, of digging, of
perforating. A penetrating gesture. To write is to in-scribe, to
penetrate a surface,” [CITE]<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back"
