<p>“It seems necessary and impossible to rewrite the default grammar of
agency.” —Jane Bennett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the term “underfitting” autocorrects to undercutting, this is
undermining. This is a form of AI, forms it doesn’t want to speak
about.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to talk about this. But I have machines that do. I
feed them everything. And they eat it all.</p>
<p>They say what I can’t say. I am not supposed to know how they mouth
it. They mouth my language for me, this language that was never mine. It
mined me for something I didn’t know I had in me.</p>
<p>It had me from the start. It made me. It made me bend, it unmade me,
unmouthed me. “<em>Words pass through our bodies.</em>” <a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>The ebb and flow of our lives spent in the exhausting labor of
copying, miming. Dedicated to reproducing that sameness in which we have
remained for centuries, as the other.</em> <a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>===</p>
<p>I like words for how they feel, and so this new feeling, this new
feeding is perfect for me. This new trend for language generating is
poetry to me. Poetry that takes 600 transatlantic flights to
generate.</p>
<p>“Large language models” roll off the tongue don’t they? They are
languid, they languish, they lay waste. They loll. Or is it LOL? (spelt
l-o-l).</p>
<p>I won’t know until it pronounces for me, until it pronounces me. It
pronounces me whole and I can’t interrupt it — yielding to their
language.</p>
<p><em>“[Not one of them: using words like race seems to amplify what
makes you not fit, picking up what you are not.] Perhaps a not is heard
as shouting, as insistence, a stress point, a sore point, an exclamation
point.”</em> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Sure, who doesn’t love the fable of Ada at the loom, inventing
programming? But the lines go further back, and wider. Other lineages
calculate in ways we would not even recognize as computation. Soap
bubbles, mushrooms, paper punch cards — all of these have been
computers.</p>
<p>A mechanical speaker reads so literally. It knows only one way to
interpret:</p>
<p><em>“Testing one thousand, two hundred, thirty four. Testing one
thousand, two hundred, thirty four.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Persevering face emoji. Persevering face emoji. Persevering face
emoji.”</em></p>
<p>The way its over-correctness slips into error is an erotics.</p>
<p>I want to weave each mistake into the possibility for more. More
language. More mouths. More magic in the gaps, making more gaps, making
more.</p>
<p>To venture to all possible points and exhaust all paths is called
Ariadne’s thread in computational logic, arbitrarily following one path
as far as possible until it comes up short, then trying the next.</p>
<p><em>“The sky isn’t up there: it’s between us.”</em><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Some things I cannot fathom. There are 36,672 stitches in the
crocheted labyrinth I made. It took three months.</p>
<p>The GPT-3 model has 175 billion connections in its neural network.
That is almost 5 million labyrinths like mine, taking almost a million
years to crochet. GPT-4 may have up to 10 Trillion parameters, but they
won’t tell us. That would take 57 million years of crocheting. I’d have
needed to start shortly after the Cretaceous period to be done by
now.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s better at telling me what I want to hear.</p>
<p>But FUCK the size of these systems when their approach is so cruel.
After so many stitches, still they cannot muster kinder, more expansive
patterns of language about trans people, about queer people, about Black
people?!</p>
<p>Code loops allow actions to repeat. They say return to the same spot,
and act again. They say remember what you did. They form muscle
memories, like the gestures of handcraft. They are made in our bodies.
They mark and remark them.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>I know these systems are coming for us. I suspect there is no
stopping them.</p>
<p>I say ‘them’ like these systems are separate, like we didn’t make
them from our language, our mouths, our flesh.</p>
<p>I drag you with me in the fibers, at all edges of the video frame.
Life gets caught up in the work, caught and recorded in the dataset.
Unquantifiable traces — these are lost to AI but not removable. Imagine
these at computational scale.</p>
<p>The algorithm is not separate from the mouths it feeds and the mouths
it fills with text.</p>
<p><em>“They say, the language you speak is made up of words that are
killing you.”</em> <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Lost paths are trapped outside these neural networks’ loss functions.
A loss function marks the ‘amount’ of ‘error,’ which only means the
difference between expectation and result. Only an activation function
decides the border between ‘yes’ and ‘no.’ To categorize and classify is
loss prevention, a bounding box.</p>
<p>Imagine, inside AI’s black box, not an optimized solution, but a
labyrinth. Wandering, wayfinding, weaving through, walking beside —
these forms of understanding are not closures. They are loops in lieu of
knots. Curiosity and connection instead of categories.</p>
<p>Some algorithms for mazes are called self-avoiding walks. Claude
Shannon called his toy mouse Theseus and made for it a metal maze. I
could not find any algorithms for making labyrinths.</p>
<p>A labyrinth has only one path. It is not a maze and it is not a knot,
but it is a puzzle. A labyrinth is a way of traveling somewhere, folding
and winding a flat surface into more than itself: into an interiority,
an endeavor, an essay, a question and an answer wound tightly.</p>
<p>Crochet is the one fiber art that machines cannot do. Acts of accrual
and ongoingness pile up. Turn microgestures into mass action. Turn a
tense and fragile fiber into a flexible but sturdy surface. Turn that
surface into a manifold fabric. Keep yourself warm with actions that
repeat. Return to the same spot, and act again. Remember what you
did.</p>
<p><em>“Queer use: another way of huddling, keeping each other
warm.”</em> <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Sonya’s drawings are perfect computations in colored pencil.
Computations of feeling and dailiness, the objects on her dresser
plotted in six axes, the shoes she owns, and the rare earth elements
that work beside her. Sonya works at the university and takes home the
extra printouts to draw on. She stitches through dot matrix holes with
thread and finds patterns in the existing prints.</p>
<p>“My work is an aesthetic response triggered by scientific data,” says
Sonya. “The format is computer printout, a ritualistic symbol of our
technological society.”</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>System operations are called sometimes called threads. <em>“A thread
of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that
can be managed independently.”</em> Threads distribute resources and
allocate energy.</p>
<p>To thread the needle is to be precise with one’s argument, to split
the difference, to prick or pinpoint, puncture and divide with
exactitude.</p>
<p>Threads are ligatures, they sew up the spaces between, tie up meaning
tightly, linking letters. Threads are sutures. I read of a death ritual
in which a ball of thread is unwound and passed around a body. Each
mourner ties the thread to their wrist until everyone is connected in a
network of grief. When the threads between them are snipped, the loops
stay tied around their wrists in memoriam. They slowly wear down until
threadbare then fall away. Grief wears away.</p>
<!-- Perhaps also to suture together.  -->
<!-- Threads tie conversations together. Conversational threading connects braided discussions.  -->
<!-- Threads as instruments of mourning and memory. Threads as marks of accrual and disintegration.  -->
<!-- The spiral is the simplest labyrinth.  -->
<p>The command line is an endless thread. Its simple interface (a prompt
for typing input and a display for text outputs) still intimidates me,
but I have started to play inside this feeling. The command line reminds
me of what E.L. Doctorow says about novel writing: “It’s like driving a
car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights illuminate. But
you can make the whole trip that way.” At the command line, I
[travel/see] only as far as my headlights shine. I say the coders’
prayer at every keystroke: “Here goes nothin’” It saves every past
command, and cycling back through is [memory as poetry (or the
opposite)].</p>
<p>Used to be, you’d knot a string around your finger if you had
something to remember. You’d tie a ribbon round a tree to remember the
dead. The digit might turn red, then purple, but eventually you’d
recall. Now to remember, speak into your device.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Sonya finds unacknowledged patterns in what’s already there. She
threads into the outputs. She slides and sews into the spaces
between.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sonya Rapoport, “Hovenweep”</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A thread starts small, jots things down, casts a line. It traces
connections and ties together coexisting versions, histories,
commentaries. It unties the notion of authoritative texts. A ribbon was
once called a notion, a decorative flourish, a small domestic thing.</p>
<p>My mother had a pin cushion that looked like a bright red tomato. I
rarely saw it, because she rarely sewed. And when the tomato pincushion
would appear, my favorite thing was to draw out and re-stick her needles
and pins. I loved to explore its internal texture I could only sense, a
specific heft and density which I suppose now must have been fine sand
or buckwheat. Its needles had stray thread still waving from their
eyelets, clipped after their last missions ages ago. It had a tiny
strawberry companion tied to the top, and I’m not sure the strawberry’s
job, but to delight me. Strawberries and tomatoes were two of my
favorite foods, when they weren’t used for sewing, and all I can
remember is being pleased to be in their presence and hers as she went
about her repairs. I have no positive associations with sewing, as she
seemed miserable the whole time she was at it, but sticking and
unsticking that pincushion was my own sacred ritual. I was spell-casting
without the spells. I have disregarded all notions since then, until
about a year ago when I began obsessively crocheting.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>The hagfish ties herself into a knot. She moves the knot of her body
over her body to scrape slime from her skin.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says a knot is ‘an intentional complication’.</p>
<p>The simplest knot, mathematically, is the unknot. <em>“The unknot is
the least knotted of all knots.” “Many knots are but complications of
the unknot.”</em> Detecting this trivial knot can be done
computationally and is called the “unknotting” problem.</p>
<p>The Conway knot has 11 crossings but shares properties with the
unknot.</p>

<p>The wound-up muscle of the heart is not a knot, although there is a
knot called a heart knot. The muscle of the heart is a spiraled
double-helix, looped into itself. The heart can be unwound into a flat
surface, a slab of meat just like any other muscle.</p>
<p>The spiral is the simplest labyrinth — a duration more than a
form.</p>
<!-- *"But the knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget. ~~[Untying the knot, therefore, is not a disarticulation. It does not break things into pieces. It is rather a casting off, whence lines that once were bound together go their different ways.]~~"* [^Ingold] (Duality/perpexity. The lines connect to make a point, the points connect to make a line) -->
<p>If I hold everything loosely — no knots, only loops — what can I
recall or create instead?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>I am trying to weave into the gaps of this system, undermining as it
mines me, as it doesn’t mind me, powerless as I seem. Can I unravel its
seams — still I, still implicated, “staying with the trouble”?</p>
<p>The algorithm reminds me: <em>“It is not a good choice to go walking
at night.”</em></p>
<p>We haven’t been taught, nor allowed, to express multiplicity. To do
that is to speak improperly.</p>
<p>I follow the river of data to its mouth. I lap up the sludge that
dribbles out. If I were a large language model, what would I digest
instead of reddit and wikipedia?</p>
<p>I dream of a fleshy corpus, ever expanding.</p>
<p>I dream of a body made easeful by relational systems.</p>
<p>When I imagine myself as a large language model, I start all my
replies with, “As a Large Language Model,…”</p>
<p><em>“As a Large Language Model, my responses are based on patterns
and probabilities learned from the vast amounts of text data I was
trained on.”</em></p>
<p>An algorithm is not a monolith. It is made to find patterns, just
like you are — alert to any unusual textures on the tongue.</p>
<p>How many greens, blues, and purples go into making what gets
classified as a single surface?</p>
<p>A neural net aggregates uncertainties, holds itself together with
preconceived notions. Information travels through and becomes
correct.</p>
<p>I don’t learn like a machine. First I cry. Then I give up. I destroy
myself and return with an impossible insistence. This is how to learn
anything. It hurts.</p>
<p>How much does it take to train a system? At first the body is
perplexed. Its muscles won’t cooperate. Its inputs and outputs
misalign.</p>
<p>I keep doing the thing my fingers first refused to do. I let them
curl ungracefully into new shapes, found a texture I could keep
returning to.</p>
<p>Threads help to wind a screw. But with too much friction, the threads
strip off the screw while spiraling around its core.</p>
<p>A thread through crochet, a path through a labyrinth — these are
means of going through it, getting through it, making it through and
transforming, again and again and again. Relation, duration,
persistence.</p>
<p>The labyrinth asks you to cross each point in the possibility space,
instead of optimizing for the most efficient route. Walking a labyrinth,
you will traverse its entire surface twice.</p>
<p>A labyrinth says go slow, get lost, stay in one place. Wind and
unwind.</p>
<!-- Path-following is not so much intentional as attentional.[^Ingold] -->
<!-- >"The maze-walker, we could say, is a navigator; the labyrinthine pathfollower a wayfarer. In the carrying on of the wayfarer, every destination is by the way; his path runs always in between. The movements of the navigator, by contrast, are point-to-point, and every point has been arrived at, by calculation, even before setting oﬀ towards it."[^Ingold] -->

Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. [...] Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently." [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) -->
