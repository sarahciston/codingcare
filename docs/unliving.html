<p>I am still alive, On Kawara. It takes so much: To get up, at a time.
To make a painting. To make a day. Day after day. You fit this feeling
in a postcard. You report the dailiness and so it is remarkable.</p>
<p>What I like about you is you don’t offer any context. Just ‘I got
up’. Just ‘I am alive’. ‘Still’, like it’s a chore. What more do you
want from me, you seem to say.</p>
<p>You wrote to Sol LeWitt. Wrote to friends in New York, France,
Sweden, Yugoslavia. You wrote every day for days and days and days and
days until you weren’t alive. But I am still alive. It doesn’t feel
remarkable, but it is.</p>
<p>Some people I know are also alive but don’t want to be. It’s hard to
know how to live, especially right now. And it always has been hard to
know how to live. It always has been ‘especially right now’. But we make
our problems our own. We evade oneness with simple words like ‘I’. We do
it on the reg.</p>
<p>Such data accumulates days. Call it a lifetime.</p>
<p>You chose a few basic rituals and stuck with them. Sometimes the only
affirmation a person can hold is ‘I am still alive’. Sometimes it is all
we can stand. Sometimes that is enough. Sometimes even that is too
much.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>I got up at 9:50am. I woke up several times before that, but I didn’t
get up. In your ‘I got up at’ postcard series, the times range wildly.
This makes me like you more. I resent shows of dedication that seem to
claim the moral high ground as the secret to success. Like if I really
wanted to ‘be an artist’ I would have gotten up at 4am — as if this is
the formula for everyone, as if we share the same capacities and
resources.</p>
<p>On Kawara, how were you feeling on APR 3 1969? I triangulate a mood
from two separate pieces you made that day. Some days you made
contributions to many datasets. Along with ‘I am still alive’ and ‘I got
up at’, you often made ‘I went’ and ‘I met’, which indexed your daily
travels (on a map) and interpersonal encounters (in a list of names). On
APR 3 1969 [your postcard says] you got up at 2:56 PM and [your map
says] you made a very tight path around your neighborhood in Manhattan.
Just four blocks by four blocks. Maybe you only went out to mail the
postcard that said ‘I GOT UP AT’ and to eat or to shop for a meal. Maybe
you didn’t eat. I assume you met with no one, because I could not find
the data. Although you were still alive, you sent no telegram to
confirm.</p>
<p>I recognize such knotted neighborhood walks in my slowest days. I
don’t mark these patterns down in red pen (except for one photography
project in college in which I traced everywhere I drove in Los Angeles
on a map before an app did this for me), but I have always seen my
‘self’ from this angle — small, mapped, abstract in relation to concepts
like ‘north’. I notice how little my movements cover the earth. I like
places where I can get up high or see far, until the horizon seems to
curve. I think, ‘I am on a planet’, and the smallness I already feel is
more palpable.</p>
<p>On other days, when I am more in a body, I notice how much space it
takes up — how it barely fits where it’s told and it aches and it moves
like my mother’s body now. I worry how much ecological impact it
contributes. I let in all these tracing technologies to admit to the
uncanny feeling I already have. But the sense of being traced by
satellites is not your telegram path or paintbrush. This is something
different from presence and displacement. [Attunement is not technical
alignment.] “Melancholy is a latent or paused anticipation of something
necessarily unknowable” <span class="citation"
data-cites="robertsonNillingProseEssays2012">(Robertson 2012)</span>.
Despite all my settings, I know the maps know where I am. I know my mom
can pull up her phone and find me: a tiny dot pulsing, still a ‘live’
representation.<!--[^a-life]--> I leave this on because she likes it
more than it bothers me. If a drone can find me, my mom might too.</p>
<!-- [^a-life]: How did 'live' come to mean 'current' instead of 'to live' or 'alive'? Conway's Game of Life is the best known example of 'a-life', or what's called artificial life, a basic algorithm in which a small set of rules play out into infinite complexity over thousands of cycles. Its shapes can be followed like an unnatural ant farm: 'gliders', 'guns', 'crawlers', and 'eaters'. Nothing about this feels 'lively' to me, so life must be something else. Its patterns look to me instead like knitting patterns for lacework.  -->
<p>===</p>
<p>On Kawara, like you, I also made artwork that tracked my daily
habits. I collected as many streams of the data I was producing as
possible. To over-know the body through data was eventually to say
nothing much at all. Collecting turns being into producing, a new kind
of labor where I do nothing but my body makes a profit that estranges
me. Over-thinking meaning, over-writing data, working-over my overworked
datapoints, rewriting the read-outs — in the ads I can become one minor
market for my dataself. I can replace proprioception with real-time
sensor feedback. Replace interoception with outputs and analyses. ‘Live’
tracking my heart rate seems redundant but appealing. It offers the
illusion of insight if I offer the sleeping, reading, breathing,
thinking I am already doing. By tracking it, extracting it, selling it,
the devices turn living into labor. Their proprietary systems make it
valuable, not me. My sleeping, reading, breathing, thinking doesn’t
matter until it’s data. Every day I get up at, and I check my heartbeat.
I check the devices which tell me, ‘I got up at’, and I charge these
devices. I spend money and time and labor on them. Every day their
systems know about me, just like Sol LeWitt knew about you from your
telegram. But we’re not friends. The data I create now implicate me in
advance — of actions I haven’t taken and devices not yet invented and
crimes not yet described. Sometimes ‘I am still alive’ is already giving
too much away.</p>
<p>I felt young and girlish when I made data art. I felt selfish. Would
I have felt that way if it was someone else’s data, someone less young-
and girlish-seeming? I got constructive criticism like, “You sure do
sleep a lot. Are you depressed?” On Kawara, I think I slept about the
same as you, and I’m sure we are both read into, and I suppose that is
some part of the point, but I still didn’t like the feeling.</p>
<p>So instead I made artworks that asked other people to share. I asked
for compassion, in small portable phrases, because I needed to learn to
like it. I wanted phrases that could be turned from sound into writing
into data packets into sound again. I thought machine learning would be
a faulty tool for this, and I wanted to show the faults. Art-making was
a way to make it weird.</p>
<p>I think you’ve noticed this. You take a normal thing, like writing
down the date, and you make it large, you make it weird. Art works best
when I’m as uncomfortable as possible. To speak to myself with
compassion, I had to make an artificial voice that sounded like an
uncanny version of me, using other people’s words, being kinder than I
was capable of at the time. I hoped that simple words from others,
transmitted repeatedly, would [rewrite/rewire] the [protocols/circuits]
in my head, just as they had [written/wired] them in the first
place.</p>
<p>“IT’S OKAY TO CRY” is tattooed on my arm in calculator font. I need
the phrase written on my body so that one day I will start to believe
it. The affirmation had already appeared in the participatory database
of compassionate phrases I made. I am always surprised that the database
“works”: People contribute to it; it soothes effectively, even if you
know its gimmicks; and its speech-to-text-to-speech processors make
poetic nonsense out of earnest feeling. I see how much gunk this machine
spits out, and yet I am still ready to believe it.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Researchers are now using machine learning to detect potential
suicidality, particularly in children and veterans. Machine analyses of
video, writing, and medical records found a wide range of correlations:
“people experiencing suicidal thoughts sighed more and laughed less than
others. When speaking, they tended to pause longer and to shorten their
vowels, making words less intelligible; their voices sounded breathier,
and they expressed more anger and less hope” and “having arthritis,
lupus, or head-and-neck cancer; taking statins or Ambien; or living in
the Western U.S. can also add to a veteran’s risk” <span
class="citation" data-cites="khullarCanTreatMental2023">(Khullar
2023)</span>. Their predictive models pinpoint high-risk adults; they
find children who may soon become anxious.</p>
<p>This worries me. Maybe it shouldn’t, but my mother always labeled me
a worrier. I worry that machine criteria makes almost all of us
suicidal. Do you pause longer than others? Do you live in the Western
US?</p>
<p>Looking for patterns, we find patterns. But what do we do with the
patterns we find? How far would I go to limit someone’s life to prevent
their death?</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Someone reminds me it is not my responsibility to keep other people
alive, no matter how much I care for them.</p>
<p>But then, whose job is it? We all keep each other alive. And lately
we are failing at this work, failing at dramatic speed. Unaliving at
accelerating pace.</p>
<p>For the last 100 days each day a girl has posted videos online from
Palestine. In each video, she begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is Bisan. I am still alive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She knows the next day she might not be. She does it anyway, knowing
any day she may be counted in the tens of thousands of people around her
who are not.</p>
<p>‘Unalive’ rewrites unspeakable death to avoid censorship by
platforms. Platforms do not read for context clues. They cannot
distinguish between deaths to discuss and deaths to erase. They cannot
distinguish between queer sexuality and pornography, although they do
claim to be able to distinguish between a male nipple and a female
nipple, even though gender is not real. Still we must spell out new
stuttering formulations like <code>s3x</code> and
<del><code>death</code></del> and <code>les</code>:bee:<code>an</code>
and <code>$uicid3</code>, to con these ‘sophisticated’ systems by
hovering in the redacted [neither-and].</p>
<p>And speaking of the void, recently [they] added a Boolean operator to
Javascript called Nullish, written <code>??</code>. (I know, right? My
feelings exactly.)</p>
<p>Nullish distinguishes <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>
from <code>False</code> and <code>NaN</code> (Not a Number), although
all of these are considered “Falsy.” Nullish hovers liminially in the
never-was or maybe-erased. Use plain ol’ <code>null</code> “when
something can optionally exist.” Nullish is meant for “when there are
multiple ways something can not exist”<span class="citation"
data-cites="massoHandlingNull">(masso n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p>Oh, to be Nullable coalescing, there or/and nothing.</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>I should have known your series “I AM STILL ALIVE” began with
un-unaliving. In DEC 1969 over three days you sent: “I NOT GOING TO
COMMIT SUICIDE DON’T WORRY”; “I AM NOT GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE WORRY”;
and “I AM GOING TO SLEEP FORGET IT.” For whatever reason, I like these
telegrams less than the nearly 900 telegrams you went on to write that
simply said, “I AM STILL ALIVE ON KAWARA.”</p>
<p>You are not still alive. I write to you as though you are, because to
write to the living who do not want to live, to write to them about
living, seems harder than to write to the dead about living. I expect
you’d have more to say about living, having written “I am still alive”
so many times. After remarking so often on the stillness of living, I
think you would you report back that living was hard. Maybe you could
explain to my friend, who does not want to, why you went on and did it
anyway.</p>
<p>Sometimes unprompted, sometimes in reply to requests and inquiries.
Your telegrams enacted your persistence as a refusal, as if to say, “I’d
prefer not to,” or as if to emphasize that your status might change in
the widened gap between sending and receipt of signal.</p>
<p>I get text messages almost every day. Some of the messages are
reports of forgetting, frustrations about forgetting, and anticipated
forgettings. I feel like a throbber, a spinning rainbow beach ball of
doom, three dots awaiting the arrival of a message being revised. I hold
my breath and wait for something to be over, which I don’t want to
happen at all. I ignore my heartbeat, though it wooshes in my ears,
though my devices capture it as data all the time. <em>Are you, or have
you ever been, an anxious child?</em></p>
<p>I don’t get many text messages from my friend, On Kawara, the one to
whom I’d like you to explain the stillness. There are no telegrams, no
tiny pulsing dot on a map. Every few months I get a meme, or a bulk
message of twenty memes. I am learning these must suffice [for
friendship]. These mean ‘I am still alive’. It’s futile to telegram back
each day, “Are you?” “Still?” “And now?”</p>
<p>On Kawara, you tediously completed each date during the day it
depicted. Each of your almost 3000 Today’s was white on monochrome
ground. The days “index only themselves” <span class="citation"
data-cites="kawaraKawaraSilenceOccasion2015">(Kawara et al.
2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, how do we index the days?</p>
<p>The too-smooth silence of drone footage over destruction. Calm
voiceover gliding above a bombed-out city.</p>
<p>For Audre Lorde, just to live can be an act of revolution: to survive
in spite of powerful forces striving to extinguish you. So many of us
live on the backs of others. And so many of us live as acts of
devotion.</p>
<p>I am still alive. Most days it doesn’t feel remarkable or enough. I
don’t know how to explain the stillness, the going on. It’s okay if you
stay in the Nullish. Just mark the days. Let something mark them for
you.</p>
