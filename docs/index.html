<!-- <span class="purple">Learning programming is often intimidating and riddled with false starts,</span> which can further marginalize the folks whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. This guidebook offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. It focuses on Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in 2019 for emerging media artists, writers, and non-engineers to think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Here, we see creative-critical code as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its <span class="purple">guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition."</span> It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now 3+ years-old community, like how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methods from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work. <span class="purple">Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</span>

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an <span class="purple">ethics of coding care</span>—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: "We all have something to teach each other." Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly "anyone can join." Rather, Coding.Care reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.  -->
