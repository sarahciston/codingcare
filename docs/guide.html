<h2>Rough starts &amp; disconnects</h2>
<p>Have you considered learning to code but felt too intimidated to try?
Have you struggled to program? Or don’t know how to apply what you’ve
learned to things you care about?</p>
<p>Maybe you’re decent with programming skills but you’d still never
consider yourself a ‘coder’. <em>Coding Care</em> is about bridging this
disconnect — the wide gulf between trying to learn coding and feeling
empowered to create with code.</p>

“the prospect of a language that is both hidden and alien to me haunts
my work on the net. Like most prejudices, it is born out of fear. I am

</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>So many people feel left out of coding communities and spaces for
learning about computation — even though we likely interact with
computation in some form every day! But I believe it is essential for
people who come from all different perspectives to share access to the
digital languages which are altering the world and what it becomes.
<em>I</em> want to live in a world that is shaped by <em>your</em> point
of view and many others’ point of views — not a world shaped only by one
narrow take on what computers can be and do.</p>
<blockquote>
“I was that convinced that I didn’t have the ability or technological
talent to learn how to write code for something. I assumed that every
person around me was miles ahead in their practice, and wondered how my
passion for creative storytelling could really play into something so
new and untouched.”

<section id="dont-stop-me-now" class="level2">
<h2>Don’t stop me now</h2>
<p>My own first experiences learning to code felt <em>awful</em>.
Lonely. Discouraging. Confusing. I had the sense I was “supposed” to
learn programming skills. It felt important, like I needed these tools
in order to create the kind of art and language and world I imagined —
but it also felt like an insurmountable chore. I had the sense everyone
else could hack it but me: <em>Why was I the only one who didn’t
understand (or care!) about these dry, boring examples? Why was I
getting lost in all the confusing, specialized vocabularies?</em> I felt
thrown into a strange landscape——I lacked even the words to ask for what
I needed, a basic knowledge of where to look, or an instinct for how to
start.</p>
<p>I wish I had known then that learning to code didn’t have to feel
like getting stuck. It didn’t have to feel like I was fitting myself
into someone else’s stencil shape of a stereotypical engineer. I wish I
had known that learning to code could feel like this:</p>

</figure>
<p>Coding has helped me feel powerful and imaginative, sometimes even
unstoppable. I learned (eventually, through trial and error)(and error
and error) that coding can be fun — even playful, relaxed, welcoming. It
can be creative, thoughtful, crafty.</p>
<p>Once I accepted that the false starts and frustrations of learning to
code are part of the process for <em>everyone</em>, that these don’t
make us ‘not real coders’, I began to push through these struggles more
easily. Whenever I persist with coding, I find it rewards my effort with
community connections, creative revelations, and more puzzling
challenges.</p>
<p>I have learned I can make coding my own, and that anyone else can
too. This guide talks about how to nurture the supportive spaces that
make this sparkly code feeling possible.</p>

<section
id="encoding-rituals-what-are-the-practices-of-coding-communities"
class="level2">
<h2>(En)coding rituals: What are the practices of coding
communities?</h2>
<p>Code is language and code is a tool for expressing and enacting
combined. But coding has “belonged” to far too few for far too long,
while the rest of us are considered outsiders to the encoded systems
that consume us.</p>
<p>Current rituals and protocols around programming are stale: The
stereotype of the hacker in a cave, clacking away at high speed as
glyphs flash on a dark screen. The gray-hoodied employees playing ping
pong in the office park, building rational white robots and ever-helpful
femmebots. The black box that obscures machine learning’s inner workings
with hype, mysticism, and elitism.</p>
<p>This guidebook wants to enrich the rituals of programming to include
the joy, community, and care necessary to make different kinds of code —
and different kinds of worlds. It explores the practices of and in
communities which are supporting new kinds of coders, too — some have
never ever coded before, some code all the time but have never felt
creative doing it!</p>
<!-- [//]: # "politics of how magic rings here w its many connotations. within larger history of cybernetics, diff meanings and connotations. acknowledge, orient more toward" -->
<p>I continually see new community members who thought they hated code
keep returning to our meetups. I see them start referring to themselves
as coders, see them share projects that express a distinctive critical
voice. This keeps reminding me the importance of open, welcoming
communities that provide intersectional, interdisciplinary learning. And
it reminds me the impacts our communities can have on how we understand
the code-based systems around us.</p>

<p>I believe in our power to reshape the world around us by
experimenting wildly with the kinds of code, tools, aesthetics, and
ethics we want to see. Although making a piece of code finally work
certainly feels like magic, this so-called ‘magic’ does not come from
men behind the curtains of big tech, hiding the keys while offering the
hype of AI which says, “trust us, this this tech is too complicated for
you,” or “just learn this tech our way.” Automated systems have always
been deeply intertwined with humans in every way, from ‘mechanical
Turks’ to crowd labor outsourced to the global majority. Not quite
magic, just us.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we bring our power to the systems we want to affect?</li>
<li>How do we change systems to suit us if we are stuck outside them –
without conforming to their encoded ways of thinking?</li>
<li>How can we build communities that facilitate alternatives?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the open questions explored by this guide — and explored
every time we practice code-making in community.</p>

<section id="code-as-collective-an-open-question" class="level2">
<h2>Code as collective: An open question</h2>
<p><em>aka What’s in this pocket guide? What’s a code collective and how
do I get one?</em></p>
<p>Creative Code Collective is the community I started in early 2019 for
media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to
co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive,
interdisciplinary space. I sent out a call, because I was looking for
others who were struggling with code same as I was, and I hoped there
might be another way — at the very least, we could struggle together. We
launched with a handful of informal mottos that included:</p>
<p><code>Scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code</code></p>
<p><code>Collaboration, not competition</code></p>
<p><code>We all have skills to teach each other</code></p>
<p>Throughout the guide I’ll share what I’ve learned while building Code
Collective — about coding, connecting, and building collectives. The
guide honors and draws from the many mentors and teachers who have
inspired it, gathering many resources found along the way. Of course the
guide includes many reflections and contributions from community members
— including coding examples and exercises, favorite projects and
personal accounts — because this work is never done in isolation. I’ll
discuss connections I’ve found between coding and other crafts like zine
publishing and fiber arts. I’ll also discuss connections to open-source,
open-access, and activist movements that shape the approach to how we
gather and what we create. The guide is a melange of materials and
methods, hopefully a spark of inspiration and the start of many
conversations around these ideas.</p>
<p>I am writing both as a representative of this community and also as
an individual greatly influenced by it and by so many other creators,
thinkers, and teachers. I want to document our work processes and
thought processes, and to honor the many entangling threads that go into
shaping a caring (coding) community.</p>
<p>The heart of this book are ten principles that have emerged through
gathering as Code Collective. They are simple tactics for anyone to
employ in their own community practices — or adapt to suit them.
Developing these tactics has been intuitive, iterative, and
collaborative. They emerged out of desire and instinct. We have expanded
and distilled these tactics influenced by other organizations, thinkers,
makers, and more; and we have reshaped them continually as our group
evolves. All recommendations in the book are intended to be descriptive,
not prescriptive. Here’s what has worked for us (and what hasn’t). I
invite you to embrace and adapt what works for you and leave the rest.
And I am interested in how these tactics change in different
circumstances, so if you find something that works better for you, I’d
be excited to learn about it too!</p>
<p>Each of the guiding principles is paired with sections called
<code>PLAY ALONG</code> – practical exercises you can try — and
<code>LIVE CODE</code> — brief case studies from other communities of
practice. Although Coding Care is a pocket guide, it also lives in large
part online as a <a
href="https://creativecodecollective.com/showcase"><code>PROJECT SHOWCASE</code></a>
of active works by Code Collective Community members and as a vibrant <a
href="https://creativecodecollective.com/resource-hub"><code>RESOURCE HUB</code></a>,
a database of tutorials, textbooks, projects, code libraries, zines, and
all manner of things we have found useful.</p>
<p>Many of the things we do to sustain supportive communities seem too
obvious to mention——or even worse, too obvious to notice — such that
they aren’t obvious <em>at all</em>. This guide is meant to remind me
that these approaches matter, and to acknowledge how much they have
supported me and others along the way. This guide celebrates those
ephemeral things that make our caring coding community go. <em>It tries
to describe our intuitive wayfinding about how to learn and teach and
explore and be together, especially in and through the very things that
both draw us in and also scare us, the things that feel both challenging
and fun, frustrating and rewarding.</em></p>
<p>It is not one gesture or one moment, but their accumulation. Each
thing we have done intentionally, and unintentionally, adds up to
<em>us</em>. To collect, to gather, to hoard like magpies. To embrace
fascination with the shiny objects even when we don’t yet know their
purpose. To trust their meaning in our gut. To trust connections with
other people. To rely on each other, to reconnect again and again, over
the smallest things. To be vulnerable in shared struggle, shared
silliness, shared delight.</p>

<section id="manifestual-what-this-pocket-guide-isnt" class="level2">
<h2>Man(ifest)ual? What this pocket guide isn’t</h2>
<p>This guide is not a manifesto, as much as I love a manifesto. Johanna
Hedva says, “a manifesto is only ever a document that reaches too far,
that speculates too impossibly, and that the only use a manifesto can
have is to lay bare why it cannot be manifested, to open itself to all
the ways its un-manifestation shapes the world” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hedvaWhyItTaking2022">(2022)</span> – yet here I document
what we’ve actually put in the world, alongside what we hope to. Code
Collective exists because I believe it is incredibly easy to have
communities like this, and I am not the only one. Like code itself, and
Code Collective, this guide strives to bring the “impossible” into the
“real world” now – as a proposition toward how it can be entirely
possible, present, liveable, and thriving. Anarchists call this
“prefiguration” but we can just call it fun. And so the pocket guide
exists somewhere between a manifesto and a manual. Make of it what you
will; I hope you do!</p>

<p>Code Collective is a self-organizing community of artists, makers,
students, people from all backgrounds — especially including those who
have not done much or any coding before. We meet regularly to develop
our programming practices in a flexible, co-working, co-learning
setting.</p>
<p>We are artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders,
computer science majors, writers, dancers, linguists, neuroscientists,
trans kids, queer folks, refugees, parents, staff and teachers,
independent learners. We come from all career stages and from all levels
of expertise. We come from many cultures, sexualities, classes, and
genders. Many of us do not come to programming from a STEM-education
pipeline (but some do). Our interests exceed the bounds of what our
specializations offer and what our vocabularies describe. We all find
different ways into code and community.</p>
<p>I started organizing the collective as an intervention. I craved a
space where I felt welcome and free to explore without constraint, after
experiencing how programming cultures had intimidated me and after
witnessing how they had discouraged so many others. I noticed the need
for supportive spaces that could value diverse capacities to learn.
After my own struggles learning to code, and after a few joyful
experiences that showed me it could be otherwise, I wanted to make space
for anyone else struggling to find their fit, anyone convinced there was
no place for them in the existing systems.</p>
<p>Code Collective was necessary for me because I kept having the
experience elsewhere that no one could understand what I was trying to
make or do. I felt like I was not making sense – and certainly I was not
sure myself – but some glimmer or gut feeling kept pulling me toward
tinkering even though I was hitting walls, getting frustrated, hearing
that it shouldn’t or couldn’t be done. Now I remind new visitors to Code
Collective: <em>If you have an inkling (or a fear) that coding might be
for you, it probably is. Welcome.</em> <span

<h2>Start anywhere</h2>
<p>Upon gathering, I ask myself: What does this particular cluster of
beings need and want from this gathering? What do we stand for? We get
to define it and redefine it for ourselves. At our first meeting in
January 2019, attendees cited a mix of desires for joining what would
become Code Collective:</p>
<ul>
<li>“to learn what [programming] language is used for what”</li>
<li>“not to be intimidated to try something new”</li>
<li>“see what others do, have a set time to work on projects and keep
skills sharp”</li>
<li>“not to check the assigned boxes but find an artistic approach. make
stuff”</li>
<li>“ask questions”</li>
<li>“see others projects and help”</li>
<li>“see weird projects and find interesting solutions”</li>
<li>“have an accountability space and a brain trust with shared
expertise”</li>
<li>“conquer my trouble starting and finishing. bounce ideas off of
others. build something I’m proud of”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
“For me, I could figure out how to code but I didn’t really know what to
use for what, for the specific things I like. Also part of the issues
here is there’s so many things you could do, right? [For the things I
do, three.js is perfect. Once I figured that out, I didn’t need to find
other things. For someone who doesn’t know how to code, give them a tool
where they can learn to do a lot so they can figure out what tools they
need — like p5.js.]”

</blockquote>
<p>To explore how we might best create community, I asked each person to
share what they were currently working on, some topics they knew about,
some topics they wanted to know about. The goal here is to look for
overlaps: Where do what you know about and what I want to know about
intersect? Here lies magic!</p>
<p>As time goes on, our needs change, and our formats and structures
keep pace. We have moved from conversations about possible group
projects, mission statements, and organizational concerns toward a more
freeform agenda, toward a blend of form and freedom that holds space for
anyone’s individual projects and needs during that meeting time.</p>
</section>
<section id="be-works-in-progress" class="level2">
<h2>Be works-in-progress</h2>
<p>When beginning the collective, I described its focus as project-based
learning, but later refined this to mean more process-oriented than
task-oriented work.</p>
<p>The group remains self-directed toward what its members want to make,
and the process they take to make it, instead of requiring they absorb a
pre-determined curriculum or complete particular objectives. Our
conversations focus more on what you are learning along the way, how you
are using the tools you found, how your technical choices are shaping
your critical thinking, and how did your critical thinking is shaping
your technical choices and tools, reciprocally and iteratively.</p>
<p>When we “value process as much as, or more than, outcomes”[^amb],
when we maintain a “beginner’s mind” approach no matter what stage of
that process, we can stay dynamic and we can acknowledge imperfection
and ongoingness. I find this helps relinquish perceived requirements and
impossible goals.</p>
<p>This guide is also a work in progress. The guide shows its rough
edges before it is ready. It has been drafted from scratch on a public
website, built using Github, which displays its code repository and
version tracking. This means that every past version of the text is
available to view. Readers can compare differences in the history (<a
href="https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commit/5e1ef814d661f43027e3d0f15b5ba87415194cfe?diff=unified">for
example</a>) line by line and comment on the text as it changes. This
laid-bare writing process enacts the Code Collective value
<code>growth, not perfection</code>, which is mostly a reminder for
myself. Working this way is a practice of vulnerability and an
invitation for conversation.</p>
</section>
<section id="dont-be-afraid-to-show-your-work" class="level2">
<h2>Don’t be afraid to show your work</h2>
<p>Show your works-in-progress! If you wait for a project to be perfect
and finished before you get feedback, you’ll never get the feedback you
need to finish.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to call the project done, or this phase of it
done, because in the next project you will deal with the same themes.
You can ask the same questions through a different tool or a different
critical lens. If you’re like me, I am always going care about many of
the same things, and I’ll return to them.</p>

<h2>Build it together, whatever ‘it’ is</h2>
<p>There are so many different outcomes and approaches possible for any
technical challenge. By spending time with others, especially with
different perspectives, we get to see how they might approach the same
problem vastly differently. Even with the exact same concept, one person
might implement it through a commercial product while another might
implement it as an expressive artwork.</p>
<p>Working among others helps us continually question and expand our
definitions. Along the way, you could each tackle similar
troubleshooting issues in lines of code, but perhaps you would answer
the questions that arise very differently based on your own goals. It
helps to expand the spectrum of what one could make or invent, as a way
to get out of our default modes and expectations for ourselves.</p>
<p>Designing the online presence for Code Collective has been an ongoing
collaboration. Through the simple but important work of creating a
website, for example, we had to confront and create our collective
identity very practically. We got to decide the tone of who we are as a
group, how we will present ourselves, and to which publics: How do we
describe what we are doing, what we prioritize, what we call ourselves,
how we explain our processes, how we support others who join? What
format do we put this in? What language do we use? Who do we make sure
is included in this process?</p>
<p>Through this process of communication and collaboration among the
group members about who we are and what we want to offer, the Code
Collective website has expanded from a static landing page into a unique
resource hub and project showcase – with a searchable, contributable
database of tools, tutorials, research, and projects we have found
useful.</p>

<h2><span class="emoji" data-emoji="mending_heart">❤️‍🩹</span> PLAY ALONG:
Break this code</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to get started with learning a new aspect of
programming is to take someone else’s example code and learn how it’s
working by changing things — just little things to start. What happens
if I make this a different color or run it at a different speed? How
does it show up on screen? Then break big things — use it for different
purposes, combine it with other code.</p>
<p>Find some example code for a website you like by right clicking on
any part of it in your web browser and hitting <code>Inspect</code>.</p>
<p>You should see some windows appear that show the HTML and CSS source
code for the site, where you can temporarily and without fear modify the
site as you wish. Give yourself a fun mini challenge. The HTML puts
items on the screen. The CSS styles those items in different shapes,
colors, fonts.</p>
<p>For example: What if a national newspaper had a purple background? Or
a different headline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick an aspect of the page you’d like to change, like the background
and right click on it.</li>
<li>Go to the CSS area that opened when you hit inspect. When you hover
over the section with your mouse, checkboxes will appear next to terms
like <code>margin</code> and <code>padding</code> and <code>font</code>,
for example.<br />
</li>
<li>Find <code>background</code> or <code>background-color:</code> and
change what follows it to say <code>purple</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about a different headline?</p>
<ul>
<li>Try right clicking on a headline you’d like to change and hitting
inspect again.</li>
<li>Find the HTML panel that opened when you hit inspect. Depending on
your browser, it’s usually on the left by default, maybe on top. You
should see the specific line of HTML that created the headline you see
in your browser.</li>
<li>If you change the text of the headline in the HTML, it will also
change in your browser. Try it!</li>
</ul>
<p>What other experiments with CSS and HTML might you try? What can you
learn using this method about how the site you chose was built?</p>
<p>This is a very aesthetic and web-based example, but you can imagine
taking this approach to any tutorial or example you see.</p>
<p>Retype it, learn how it works, break it for fun or for your own
purposes.</p>

<section id="we-get-scrappy" class="level1">
<h1>2. We get scrappy</h1>
<p>Code Collective endorses
<code>scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code</code>. We love your
spaghetti code, your half-finished thought, your sketchy mindmap — just
as much as we love the polished work it may one day be. When someone
joins up wanting to try something new, we don’t say, “That’s not what
code is for.” Instead we’re excited to discover yet another thing code
can be for and how we can help them figure it out.</p>
<p>We echo the call from the P5.js community statement, which warns
against “code snobs” and assuming or prioritizing types of
knowledge.[^p5] There is no programming language empirically better than
any other; there’s only the right tool for a particular task, for a
particular person, at a particular point in time. It’s totally fine to
rely on code libraries and examples and the wisdom of those who came
before you. Who doesn’t!? We will always be reliant on collected and

<h2>Don’t be afraid to break stuff (you can’t <em>really</em> break
it)</h2>
<p>How do you start getting scrappy instead of studious? Break things!
Or at least, don’t be afraid to. The <a
href="https://tinkertank.de/">TinkerTank</a> mobile makerspace in
Germany starts each of their workshops by selecting a piece of old
electronics from their scrap pile — and completely dismantling it.
“People are afraid to break things,” workshop leader Johannes May told
me, and this helps warm people up to build new, imaginative things from
the broken parts.</p>
<p>Too often I don’t get started because I don’t know where to start,
and also because I am afraid to “mess up” what already exists. That’s
what backups and save-as and sketches are for. You can’t (irrevocably)
break anything, in all likelihood. And in the process of tinkering
(which is just breaking with flair) you learn a lot!<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">To tinker is also to mend, to patch up, repair, or
improve in a makeshift way [OED]. The word derives in part from the
tasks of metalworkers (per Miller Puckette &amp; OED).<br />
<br />
</span></span> So try to push through the fear of breaking something, or
doing something “wrong,” to make space for doing something “weird” aka
interesting. So, knowing that you can’t really break it, get
cracking!</p>
<p>I learned to use scrappy artistic strategies from my first
computational arts teacher, <a
href="https://visarts.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/brett-stalbaum.html">Brett
Stalbaum</a>. I was a poet who wanted to make weird books, and he told
me simply, “Pick something small you want to try to make, and use that
to begin learning Python.” Reader—I was <em>terrified</em>. I had been
making tiny GIF poems and had tried and failed repeatedly to teach
myself some HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But none of it would stick.
Still, I trusted Brett, so I found a little example code for a simple
chatbot and used it to make what would become “ladymouth” — a bot that
tries to explain feminism to misogynists online. Along the way, I
learned enough about Python and SQLite and Raspberry Pi and toxic Reddit
forums to make it run, even though I started with zero vocabulary and
knowledge about relational databases<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Relational databases (like SQLite) are one way to
structure stored data that puts information in tables. It describes the
relationships pieces of info have to each other through its fixed
structures, which are established before the information is entered. For
example, an address book of an extended family might include a table
that lists people and their home addresses. It might include a second
table that shows houses and the people who live in each house. These
tables could be cross-referenced by ID numbers given to each person and
address. So, the information is stored in multiple tables in based on
its relationship to other information. This can be very useful, but also
very brittle, which has led to unstructured non-relational databases.
These have their own pros and cons, too. For some facinating reflections
on how database structures shape the way we see information, see Tara
McPherson’s <em>Feminist in a Software Lab</em>, in which she describes
developing more flexible structures for scholars working with
unconventional data <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018">(McPherson
2018)</span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span> or APIs<span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">APIs are the access points for the code you write to
reach different services and tools online. API stands for Application
Program Interface. In the same way a web interface (browser protocol)
helps a human reach a website by giving it structure, an API tells your
code what constraints it needs to reach that site using programming.
Like ordering from a menu, an API tells the programmer what they can
order and how to request the information they need. When coders use
APIs, they’re pulling data or tools into their program from the outside
— for example the <a
href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api">National
Weather Service</a> — on top of the code they have written themselves.
The downside of relying on external APIs is of course when one link in
the chain breaks, when a company gets bought by a bigger one and shuts
down its open source access, or updates their system… your code also
breaks. (Hence the duct tape.)<br />
<br />
</span></span> or anything else. Through Brett’s positive encouragement,
and by finding the right tools for the job (Python was the language that
made sense to me when other languages didn’t), I slowly overcame my
belief that I wasn’t a coder, that I couldn’t understand the tools I
wanted to use, and that I didn’t belong in the spaces that interested me
(or that I didn’t even know about). Being among others who were
experimenting in these same ways taught me it was okay not to have all
the pieces in place right away.</p>

<h2>Critical breaking</h2>
<p>If something exists, ask how it does. Ask if it should. Reverse
engineer it. Run it backward. Learn from others’ tutorials. Combine
them. Modify them liberally. Pull from everywhere and remix wildly. Cite
generously.</p>
<p>This is part of what we mean by scrappy — thoughtfully or playfully
experimenting with the properties and limits of your materials, whether
those materials are strings of wool or strings of code. This kind of
“breaking” things is an essential artistic practice, and it looks
different in every situation. It can range from off-the-cuff
experimentation – “What happens if I push this?” — to full-fledged
tactical media artworks that operate by digital civil disobedience –
like the collective Electronic Disturbance Theater, which created the
tool ‘FloodNet’ to shut down government websites by pinging them
repeatedly (called a “distributed denial of service” attack)<span
class="citation" data-cites="NETARTANTHOLOGY2016">(<span>“NET ART
ANTHOLOGY: FloodNet”</span> 2016)</span>. For my past projects, this has
ranged from diving into technology spaces I dislike (Reddit forums),
tinkering with combining wildly different APIs, and putting poetry into
machine learning systems meant for corporate use.</p>
<p>Critically breaking things helps us understand how they work (or
don’t work) from inside. It lets us understand some of the why behind
their operations, the decisions that went into making them. Who are they
made for? And with what goals? Who are they not made for and who do they
not serve? It helps us think about how we might make them differently. I
break stuff to see if its not-working can create some poetry, some
community, some other way to engage with value than its original (likely
capitalist) purpose.</p>
<p>Maybe all this tinkering doesn’t feel “important” or “relevant”
enough? Don’t worry about that yet. Tinkering is a transferrable,
lifelong skill:</p>

<p>Build something to prove to yourself that it can exist or it

<p>Build something to show that building is for anyone. These objects

<p>When the tool you need for building doesn’t exist, build that too.
Make it from existing tools you scrapped for parts.</p>
<p>When you don’t know the programming language you need for what you’re
building, trust you can pick up just enough of it to get by along the
way. Write it out on paper if you don’t know how to build it with code.
Show it to a friend who can point you in a new direction.</p>
<p>Find an example that looks enough like what you imagine to
extrapolate. When you can’t find a tutorial, don’t assume it can’t be
done. Don’t assume it isn’t meant to be done. This means you might be
the one to do it.</p>
<p>Try asking with new language, asking a friend with a different
background, asking with hands in the dirt, asking while tinkering on
another project in another medium, asking while doodling or napping.
Take breaks, but keep asking until answers circle back. Write it out on

<section id="get-sticky-listen-to-materials" class="level2">
<h2>Get sticky, listen to materials</h2>
<p>I joke that my projects are held together with duct tape and
spitballs, but it’s basically true. Most of them use a wild-sourced
daisy chain of APIs and random tools from different domains, because
this is what it requires to sketch out an idea I haven’t seen
represented elsewhere. There is magic and politics and new knowledge to
be found in creative (read: unintended, inappropriate) applications and
combinations of existing tools.</p>
<p>To think about how to combine ingredients to produce new flavors,
connect dots, (mix metaphors) is an explicitly artistic approach,
because it is a way of thinking with (and against) materials <em>as
such</em>. It questions and engages the material properties of the
platforms, codes, cultures, data, and infrastructures, in the same ways
artists explore other materials — whether paint color, wood grain, fiber
textures, or anything else. Listening to your materials can make work
self-reflexive in incredibly useful and critical ways, whether you
decide to work with or against their attributes.</p>
<p>One way to combine wildly is to work wildly with metaphors, as Ren
Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard do when they unpack the acronym CS
to expand the field of “computer science” to include “Chance and
Scandal,” “Crying Sabotage,” “Careful Slugs,” and more. They suggest
this “promiscuous metaphorical practice” can open up different plans,
questions, and techniques in the field – including considerations of
crip-technoscience and of more-than-human world:</p>
<blockquote>
“We follow CS (Careful Slugs) in how it might reroute, chomp away, do
nothing about, slime up, slow down, or ripple towards attachments as a
way of accounting for, unsettling, taking responsibility for, and
remaking dominant universalisms of CS (Computer Science). We propose
that when computation is approached through the speculation of CS
(Careful Slugs), the computational operations of sorting become slowed
down, separating becomes impossible as sticky bodies stick to surfaces,
categorizing becomes softened.”

trails.</p>

<h2>Learn how to learn</h2>
<p>The goal is <code>growth not perfection</code>. You will never get to
“the end” where you have learned the entirety of a programming language.
There will always be more to learn. Rather, the goal is to learn how to
learn - to learn how to find the language to describe the questions you
want to ask. With this skill alone, you already have all the tools you
need to find the tools you need, all the skills you need to learn the
skills you need — to make or do anything at all, eventually.</p>
<p>How do we learn how to learn? We tinker and stretch a bit — whether
in breadth or depth or both. We work from the foundations of what we
already know and use it as metaphors to help us understand what we don’t
yet know. We question the foundations of what we already know and use
new information to reflect on it in new contexts. We collage and combine
and experiment with what might go together unexpectedly, what we might
have taken for granted right in front of us. How did you learn the
things you most enjoy? Was it from a text book or from your own
explorations? What kinds of exploratory approaches work best for
you?</p>

<section id="read-code-like-a-book" class="level2">
<h2>Read code like a book</h2>
<p>A big part of coding creatively and critically is remembering that
all code is <em>written</em> and it is written by people. There is no
one way to code, and so we can learn a lot by reading (yes, reading) the
code of many people. Just like with books in our first language, we can
read first to understand what the code does, then to understand how this
coder solved their task, then also read for style! Would you address
their task in the same way? How would you write this code in a different
programming language or to build on their ideas?</p>
<p>Researcher Mark Marino, who helped develop the field of Critical Code
Studies, says “Code also has qualities: clarity versus obfuscation,
verbosity versus concision, elegance versus sloppiness.” He offers many
options for ways to read code, including looking at how it changes over
time, comparing it to its outputs, creating visualizations of the code,
and writing more code to understand the code. Readings of code can also
extend beyond the lines of the program itself. Marino asks:</p>
<blockquote>
Who wrote the code? When and why? In what language was the code written?
What programming paradigm was used? Was it written for a particular
platform (hardware or software)? How did the code change over time? What
material or social constraints impacted the creation of this code? How
does this code respond to the context in which it was created? How was
the code received by others? Although many of these questions address
the technical aspects of the code, I do not want to limit context to the
material condition of the code itself. […] The critical in critical code
studies encourages also exploring the social context through the entry
point of code.

<p>Fundamentally, even if you’re not looking for deeper meanings in the
code, actually <em>for-real reading</em> the code you encounter can help
you learn to code better than almost anything else. It may seem tedious,
but: Type out the examples you use, rather than copying and pasting
them. Follow along with your finger on the page as the functions return
to different sections and the loops re-loop. This act of readind “runs
the code” in your mind, so that you can truly understand what is
happening on the screen when you write all those brackets and
semi-colons. Once you understand that, you can begin to ask questions
about the implications of each way of writing — knowing there’s no one
way, no “right” way, to write code.</p>

<p>Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must get vulnerable
about our craft. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. We can
connect with each other around areas of concern, taking comfort that
someone else has already worried the very same thing. Rather than
showing a veneer of know-it-all authority (which is often quite thin),
sets up both a one-directional hierarchy of exchange and an impossible
standard for students other community members to meet. It shows them a
person who “already knows” but it doesn’t show them how to get
there.</p>
<p>I am continually finding that my presence in learning spaces as a
vulnerable, uncertain, artistic queer body — who nevertheless creates —
does much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually
have said in a lecture. All the other suggestions that follow were
possible because I modeled them first. I said, “I don’t know either,
let’s figure it out together.”</p>
<p>The socially awkward planner in me wants to know in advance what’s
going to happen in every session. But the less I plan and structure, and
instead gesture and invite, the more space exists for group needs and
wants as they arise. Some of my favorite teachers have huge,
well-prepared slide decks that I’ve seen them chuck out the moment the
class discussion went another direction. I never understood that before,
because I wanted to suck all that knowledge out of my teachers’ heads.
Now that I’m teaching, I get it. I’m much more interested in what my
students want to know than what I have to say. And when they share what
they want to know, I have to trust that I’ll have something to offer in
return that can enrich, support, or connect with their interests
instead.</p>
<p>Your milage may vary, as mine has! I want to acknowledge that some
folks are given much more leeway to display uncertainty while retaining
their authority and respect than others are. I understand that your
vulnerability will have boundaries and capacity limits, as mine does.
e.g. It looks very different for a white male professor with job
security to engage “casually” or “flexibly” and still receive the
benefit of the doubt when he is up for review. I want to use the
privilege I have as a white person who has learned to “speak academic”
(in the contexts where I must) to turn that voice off where I can and
dismantle those structures as much as I can. I still worry about how I
am perceived — “too feely” or “too feminine” or “too casual” — in my
non-binary queer femme graduate student instability. But however
possible, I want to make it more comfortable for folks like me — and
better yet for folks unlike me who may be exist even more precariously
in academic or technologist spaces — to have a home here too. That
doesn’t happen without those of us who have the capacity shutting off
the gatekeeping rhetoric.</p>
<blockquote>
“I let students see me make mistakes; I thank them for identifying those
mistakes and engaging with the lecture. I ask them why that was a
mistake and create conversation because students need to see experts
fail too. Failure is part of learning, part of life and part of moving
forward. As a young female instructor, failing in front of students can
easily backfire. There have certainly been indications that this
confirmed to some that I have no idea what I’m doing and that I’m not
qualified. Despite that, I will continue to fail in front of my students
and call myself out on it, because it makes the classroom a place they
know they can try, fail and grow. If I can have a code failure in front
of 200 of them and I’m supposed to know what I’m doing, they can fail in
front of their lab partner or their roommate while they’re taking their
first class”

<p>It is wild to me that the idea of stupid questions feels so
predetermined that I might enter a space where I don’t know what a
variable is, but I know I am not supposed to ask. Why do we communicate
so much more clearly about social norms than about the information we
are there to share and understand? Or the information that will help
people feel welcome and at ease?</p>
<p>If you can, be brave. Try voicing your “stupid” questions, nagging
suspicions, and fears.</p>
<p>Without fail, when someone asks what they’d call a “stupid” question,
it is a question others have too. Or it’s a question they’ve been taking
for granted and haven’t considered before. Usually it requires even
those who think they already know the answer to think more deeply about
the question in order to answer it in plain language.</p>
<p>So-called stupid questions help us all unpack what we consider
assumed knowledge. Frequently, assumed knowledge points to the
foundations of a field of study and how its histories are told through
lenses of white supremacy, misogyny, colonialism, and ableism. We should
all be asking these questions to understand our work and our contexts
through new lenses. In this way, the “beginner” in the room makes one of
the largest contributions to everyone’s co-learning experience.</p>
<blockquote>
“Any nitwit can understand computers, and many do. Unfortunately, due to
ridiculous historical circumstances, computers have been made a mystery
to most of the world. And this situation does not seem to be improving.
You hear more and more about computers, but to most people it’s just one
big blur. The people who know about computers often seem unwilling to
explain things or answer your questions. Stereotyped notions develop
about computers operating in fixed ways — and so confusion increases.
The chasm between laymen and computer people widens fast and
dangerously. […] Most of what is written about computers for the layman
is either unreadable or silly.”

<p>Live coding, though it might seem counterintuitive, sparks
confidence. It helps to watch another coder, whether brilliant or
beginner or both, struggle under the familiar burden of a problem — that
feeling that they cannot solve it, that they’re unfit to call themselves
real coders, that they’re imposters, and that the feeling will never
ever go away. Then watching them collaborate with others to solve it.
Remember that person the next time you feel the same way. You won’t
always feel that way.</p>
<p>When we are together and witness each other struggle, that
commonality reveals lightness and joy through community support. (You’re
not going insane, because you’re not the <em>only one</em> who’s gone
insane staring at their code before. Yes, you do need sleep. Yes, you’ll
figure it out, or you’ll figure something out. And we’re here to
help.)</p>

<h2>Work iteratively, celebrate progress</h2>
<p>When we don’t share our struggles with learning, it’s incredibly easy
to feel alone. It’s easy to compare our efforts to other people’s
polished, finished products — of course, in that case, we find our
half-complete creations wanting. This is true for all kinds of learning,
including just learning to be in the world. There is no final state;
there is continuous learning.</p>
<p>For example, I am writing this pocket guide in a git repo (short for
repository, meaning in this case a type of archive used in programming
to keep track of versions and allow multiple users to make edits). I
continually update it and save it on a public Github Pages website,
which means both that you are reading a work in progress and also that
anyone can see any prior version of it any time (<a
href="https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commits/Jekyll/posts/guide.md">here</a>).
I started this practice in 2020 when I wanted to show the process and
performance of academic work that was ongoing labor rather than the
invisible production of perfect, authoritative, publishable static
documents.</p>
<p>I see this approach as an echo of publications like zines, which
aren’t afraid to show their rough, handmade edges. And I am inspired by
books like Winnie Soon and Geoff Cox’s 2021 book <a
href="https://aesthetic-programming.net/">Aesthetic Programming</a>,
which was also written using git and exists in open, hybrid, print and
digital forms. Soon and Cox posed the git format as an invitation to
others to “fork the book” and adapt it to their own needs, in order to
expand the book’s community of practice.</p>
<p>We need more spaces that embrace and reflect the many different kinds
of learning and ongoing forms of creation.</p>
</section>
<section id="rely-on-others" class="level2">
<h2>Rely on others</h2>
<p>Mark Marino and I took up Cox and Soon’s creation-as-invitation and
‘forked’ their text, adding our own “Chapter 8.5” to their book. We were
incredibly moved by the vulnerability that Cox and Soon showed by
offering their work for others to adapt, and that gesture made us want
to get more vulnerable too. We added what we called “Code Confessions”
that emphasized “the ways we learn in community, revealing that the
teacher programmer didn’t always know what they’re doing and may still
find their way with a beginner’s mindset.” Through these asides, we
tried expand the idea of comments to show our own lived experience with
code, to admit our fears and acknowledge mistakes:</p>
<blockquote>
These sections personalize the approach and dismantle the authoritarian
hierarchy or boundary between knowledge ‘holder’ and knowledge ‘seeker’.
[…] They stand opposed to encoded chauvinism, or the toxic brogrammer
culture that can be so off-putting to new programmers, especially those
who come from outside the dominant culture.”

<p>My own personal artistic mantra is to “move toward the weird.” In my
practice, how I follow my interests and push my research forward is find
the most strange, uncanny, uncomfortable aspects of whatever I’m working
on. If something makes me cringe, that’s a place to explore (within
limits of course). Rather than research questions I can test and answer
with hypotheses, I’m interested in the <em>research tensions</em> I know
I won’t solve but keep bugging me in a visceral way. In my case, it has
included the discomfiting way technologies insinuate themselves into our
intimate experiences (what I call “creepvenience”), through things like
personal data tracking, or the way machine learning systems carry with
them the residues of their training data language into their outputs. It
has included filming myself and tracking myself, because I am super
uncomfortable both of those and they feel weird but interesting. What
would be your strange but fascinating thing? How do you like to get
weird?</p>

<section id="fight-for-the-silly-photo" class="level2">
<h2>Fight for the silly photo</h2>
<p>Anywhere you can take silliness seriously is a space to expand. You
might think I’m joking, but I learned this through experience.</p>
<p>A few years ago I ran my first a workshop where we made zines and
talked about AI. It was incredibly fun, and at the end we took a group
photo to remember it by. First we took a normal photo and then a silly
one. The professional photographer showed us the thumbnails in their
camera, and Julia Kloiber from <a
href="https://superrr.net/about/">Superrr Lab</a> took a picture of the
silly photo inside camera’s preview screen. We had a good laugh about
this meta moment. Later Julia posted the picture-in-picture online, and
I’m so grateful, because without it that image would have been lost
forever.</p>
<p>When I got all the day’s photos back from the photographer, there was
our single group photo. We looked fine — but bored as hell. Nowhere was
our silly photo, the one that captured the entire joyful spirit of the
event. They had edited our photos out and didn’t think the silly photo
was important.</p>
<p>Without that glimpse, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame
of a frame, I would not have known what was missing, or why I’d had the
instinct to ask for a silly photo in the first place (or a photo at
all). But the very community itself is the entire point.</p>
<p>Without Julia’s silly picture-in-picture of a silly picture, I would
not have been so bothered by that missing photo and its contrast to our
stiff, serious, professional group photo, that I spent several days
sending embarrassing emails, tracking down the photographer and the
original memory card, to locate the precious silly photo — because that
precious silly photo so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of
the day.</p>
<p>Don’t be shy, fight for your silly photos and the moments that don’t
seem like they should matter. They do!</p>
<p>GIFs, TikTok dances, whatever’s your thing… What brings a smile to
your face and a sense of levity to your experience? What can you connect
around? How can we take ourselves less seriously even as we engage in
the serious business of reimagining the world?</p>

flexibility, their decentralized nervous systems, their twisty turny
mystery and ability to go deep.</p>
<p>Our other, unofficial mascots are the queer misfit pirates from the
TV show <em>Our Flag Means Death</em>. They support and champion each
other, do projects together, explore their identities, figure out their
career goals, and fumble new skills while going on adventures. Like
them, we are a rag-tag troupe, a dead poets’ society, a not-so-secret
guild, and a mad scientist’s laboratory all wrapped together.</p>
<p>These the vibe of our group and remind us to enjoy that vibe too.

<p>I was taught knitting and was convinced I could not do it, just as I
was taught crochet before that, and was again convinced I could not,
until — (eventually) willing to stumble through my own inept moments and
make my own weird way — I could.</p>
<p>Turns out there are two completely different ways to teach knitting,
and I was taught the way that did not make sense to me. Once I found the
<em>other way</em> it clicked. In fact, there <em>far more</em> than two
ways to knit than just “English” or “Continental” (gosh, don’t those
sound like colonizers’ terms), because people have been doing this craft
all over the world for millennia.</p>
<p>Point is, there’s almost always more than one way to knit a loop or
code a loop! If you try it the way you’re first taught, and it doesn’t
work for you? Allow for the possibility that another way might work for
how your body-mind works. Invent a ‘weird’ way that works for you
instead.</p>
<p>And if you came to coding, or crafting or anything else, by an
alternate path — such that your way of thinking or doing doesn’t match
the ways of those around you? Congratulate yourself for bringing your
outlook into their world, and embrace what you can learn from theirs,
rather than fearing it means you didn’t really learn the ‘right’
way.</p>

approach, and so on. Sometimes coding seems more like carving a piece of

<p>Every four years, at the height of summer, tens of thousands of
coders and hackers gather at a decommissioned brickworks yard in
northern Germany. For a week straight, they camp together and code
together in “a relaxed atmosphere for free exchange of technical,
social, and political ideas.” There is no other set objective, but to
reconnect over what they love. <a
href="https://media.ccc.de/b/conferences/camp/2023">Chaos Communication
Camp</a> has happened since 1999, as an outgrowth of the European hacker
association <a href="https://www.ccc.de/en/club">Chaos Computer Club</a>
which formed in 1981 as a decentralized community.</p>
<p>When I attended the camp in 2023, I was not prepared for the
expansive, welcoming, playful community I joined. Imagine Burning Man
with more computers (and no helicopters or sand or big wigs). Groups
self-organized into villages, bringing in their own infrastructure and
building it up from scratch, decorating them into themed spaces with
lots of glow lights and services. Along with the scheduled performances
and talks, impromptu events happened all hours, and trade economies
proliferated. The portapotties which dotted the landscape every few
meters were not toilets but data hubs. Soldering, lockpicking, osint,
and many other skills were on offer. There was a postal service and a
nightclub, both diligently operated by volunteers. Kids made robots,
adults poured beer, we all danced in the rain.</p>
<p>Although this event was of course about software and hardware, it was
also more than anything about turning our collective energy toward
communal resource sharing. I was reminded again and again of the Code
Collective ethos “We all have something to teach each other” and wished
I had known about Chaos Camp’s scrappy artistic approach when I started
our collective.</p>
<p>You can get a sense of the variety of <a
href="https://media.ccc.de/">official offerings at Chaos gatherings</a>,
incluing talks on a very wide range of topics from past camps and
congresses going back 30 years (EN, DE, ES).</p>

“The development of gooey [GUI] was a project to create an accessible
computer, lessening the burden of knowledge required to complete a task.
But this also created the ‘user’ as we know it by creating a
user/programmer dichotomy. The desire for a black screen is that of
removing the dichotomy in favor of an interface without subjection,
without users and/or programmers alike. […] Black gooey might then be a
platform of slowness (‘dragged time’, ‘colored time’) […], refusal,
thought, complexity, critique, softness, loudness, transparency,
uselessness, and brokenness. A planar body that longs for the solitude
and vastness of the commandline, yet nuanced and sharp, to usurp and

<p>Both these formal languages involve “the use of constructs familiar
to programmers: modules of instructions, subroutines, global variables,
means for specifying conditions, and iteration.” Nardi says when people
have an interest, they can quickly learn the notations, forms, and
relations of that system. This may seem obvious, but “People are likely
to be better at learning and using computer languages that closely match
their interests and their domain knowledge.”</p>

<p>Teaching others helps us learn. In our practice at Code Collective,
we co-work, co-teach, and co-learn. These practices combine seamlessly
and simultaneously. When I’m explaining to someone how something works
that I think I understand, I find new ways to understand it better. When
I am asked a question I don’t know the answer to, I find new
opportunities to learn together. Teaching <em>is</em> learning and
learning <em>is</em> teaching. And co-working cooperatively facilitates
both.</p>

Pair wayfinding</h2>
<p>In programming companies there is a concept called “pair
programming,” in which two people code together at one computer,
switching roles between who is writing code and who is reviewing it. In
this exercise, pair up with another person who shares an interest of
yours — it can be programming related or not — and go on an
investigation together. Start with a small question you’re both up for
investigating. It can be a technical question or a theoretical one. Set
a timer for 20 minutes or 40 minutes (you can switch every 10), and let
your conversation around your question lead the “internet walk” you
take. How does working with a pal help you revise your question? How
does it shape what you find? How will you both take what you find into
your own practices and use it differently?</p>

<h2>Get influenced</h2>
<p>We let ourselves be flexible and fluid, spongy and influenced. Or at
least, we try to start from that position, acknowledging this is hard.
We all get excited or have preconceived ideas about how something
“should” look or “should” work or “should” be. We have learned that we
learn a lot more when we are patient with each other and let more
information be revealed.</p>
<p>I include myself in this! Through conversations about what we’re
making and imagining, I try to model my own artistic research practice
that prioritizes comfort with uncertainty and multiple approaches. I
focus on dialog exchange rather than prescriptive lectures, and fully
integrate critical and creative approaches, until it does not feel like
‘teaching’ but sharing and connecting. There are many structures
designed to keep us from learning from each other in these ways,
including our own resistance. But it is worthwhile if you are
willing.</p>

“A lot of the the values that I was trying to hold on to would be a lot

towards — I wouldn’t even call it destruction but I would have lost a
lot. […] A huge amount of empathy or a criticality has remained. That’s
that’s what I’m taking with me and that’s what I will keep, and I hope
to replicate it in some form.”

<section id="adjust-for-whats-needed" class="level2">
<h2>Adjust for what’s needed</h2>
<p>Adapting our systems to our particular needs and those of others
tends to make those systems more accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>What are the basics people need to get in the door and be comfortable
there? Hold meetings at times people can show up, in spaces with
multiple access alternatives and all-gender restrooms. Are you including
community members who have multiple jobs, at odd hours? Children they
need to bring along? Sensory or language requirements? Anything that
allows you or prevents you from participating is a factor of access.
This can include physical accessibility, knowledge and language
inclusion, the many intersectional aspects of diversity, and more.</p>
<p>Consider how you can account for what your community needs (and what
your potential community might need!). Feminist.AI, a collective in Los
Angeles, provides a great model for this by scheduling their meetups
during a mix of days, evenings, and weekends, and providing childcare —
which had not been commonly available for tech events when they started
<span class="citation"
data-cites="FeministAI">(<span>“Feminist.AI”</span> n.d.)</span>. If
something like this sounds unatainable, think about how you might
provide access through mutual aid partnerships, or how you can rotate
duties among team members.</p>
<p>Two of the simplest things you can do for any event are to provide
details about the existing accessibility of the space you currently use,
and to ask participants what provisions they need. This is something I
have not been good at in the past, because I have been able to take for
granted that I can reach a building, get inside, be somewhat comfortable
when I am there. As some aspects of that privilege change for me (while
some don’t or don’t yet), I keep realizing how helpful it is to know in
advance what to expect. Sometimes this determines whether it’s worth it
for me to try to attend an event at all.</p>
<p>How do you create an accessibility description of your space?
Offering details on your group or event pages about public
transportation, parking, seating, steps and ramps, toilets,
translations, sensory inputs, and any additional particulars of your
space will help everyone know what to expect. What will be provided?
What cannot be provided at this time? Who is the point of contact for
questions about access? Here is an example of an accessibility outline
from the <a
href="https://vvvvvvaria.org/en/pages/accessibility.html">varia</a>
community in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The same is true of the digital spaces we create. The open-source
software community P5.js took an active approach to access when they
declared in 2019 that they would only build in new features to their
software that supported increased access, broadly construed. They have
included increasing support for translation, assistive tech, friendly
error messages and contributor resources, and mentorship of historically
excluded communities all under this umbrella of their <a
href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/access.md">Focus
on Access</a>. More resources on digital accessibility were highlighted
during <a href="https://p5js.org/community/p5js-access-day-2022.html">p5
Access Day 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Putting access first creates features that support everyone, no
matter their access needs. Addressing the problems of the marginalized
majority — from offering alt text to accessible bathrooms to multimodal
notetaking — offers multiple points of entry for many people. How can
your community share responsibilities of organizing and supporting your
gatherings? How else can you acknowledge and account for the many ways
we show up?</p>
</section>
<section id="acknowledge-context-together" class="level2">
<h2>Acknowledge context together</h2>
<blockquote>
“[Code Collective] helped me place coding within a sort of historical
landscape and to understand that coding is a social act. It’s the build
up of hundreds of years of history, of traditions. This is not just
something that you do on your computer, you are also part of a
generation that will affect future generations.”
<footer>
–ender, Columbia Applied Mathematics
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>We acknowledge the many different contexts that bring us to the same
space, different backgrounds and different baselines for how we operate
and understand. While we each have our own “default” assumptions, we try
to remember these are not common sense, they are situated. This means
that they carry with them a host of “situations” that shaped them. They
come from somewhere and somewhen.</p>
<p>It helps to acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and
languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals. Our choices
have histories. They come with cultures and politics attached.</p>
<blockquote>
“Situated Computation is an approach to computational design that
grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the
historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It
acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological
infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and
political structures that shape it.”
<footer>
–Dr. Vernelle A. A. Noel <span class="citation"
data-cites="SitCoLab">(n.d.)</span>
</footer>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only does acknowledging situated context help create better
relationships among community members, it helps make interesting,
engaging works of creative–critical code.</p>
<blockquote>
“I’m a human being, and for me politics is just saying I have opinions
about what happens to me and other human beings. It’s not like some
abstract thing that does not affect my daily life. I’m not able to
separate it from technology, which is also a part of my daily life that
I take part in because I’m a human being. It’s all part of my humanness.
I can’t just pick apart different things and bring them with me at
different times, so it’s very difficult to be part of tech spaces which
want to be apolitical, because that in itself is not a neutral political
stance. […] you’re pretending that there’s no politics. But in reality
your political leaning is just maintaining the status quo.”

<section id="address-difference-and-power" class="level2">
<h2>Address difference and power</h2>
<p>We strive to strike a balance that is neither the top-down hierarchy
of a classroom nor the chaos of a structureless blob.</p>
<p>Difference and power exist. Hierarchies exist. Let’s not pretend they
don’t. Too many communities eagerly proclaim, “This is a safe space,” or
an equal or free space, only to see this ‘safety’, ‘equality’, and
‘freedom’ play out more for some than for others. We must acknowledge
existing hierarchies in order to address them. If we want to build
equitable communities, we cannot ignore the imbalanced contexts in which
we enter. By acknowledging these contexts more openly, we can work with
them, work through them, and shift them.</p>
<p>What kinds of hierarchies exist? There may be obvious ones, if your
community is made of teachers and students. There may be less obvious
ones. Your community no doubt includes different demographic groups and
people with a range of life experiences.</p>
<p>How do we acknowledge them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Not assuming defaults when you speak, when you plan and organize,
when you host events, when you write code.</li>
<li>A bit of structure helps. Codes of conduct or community agreements
provide understandings around the way we conduct our conversations and
other interactions (see <a
href="#live-code-write-your-values-imagine-your-community">Section 10:
LIVE CODE: Write your values</a>).</li>
<li>Building routines and other structures that establish balance and
equal access to resources, like the opening check-ins discussed in
Section 8 that make sure everyone has an opportunity to share.</li>
</ul>
<p>In tech communities, a myth of equal access to digital resources and
DIY materials led many to propose that makerspaces and hacklabs could be
egalitarian, freeform spaces. Communications professor and open-source
community researcher Christina Dunbar-Hester has shown how approaches
that promoted open-ended free speech and diversity without guidelines
actually ended up reinforcing existing power imbalances. In open-source
coding communities and hackerspaces, this led to marginalized people
moving on from these spaces to create their own communities instead
<span class="citation"
data-cites="dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019">(Dunbar-Hester
2019)</span>.</p>
<p>While these spaces may seem apart from “big tech” and thus have more
opportunity to be free of its problems, Dunbar-Hester found they still
suffered the same pitfalls as larger institutions. Their informal
structures, mostly run through volunteers, struggled to welcome new,
dissimilar membership and viewpoints and critical self-reflection.</p>
<blockquote>
“the potential for differences in how participants are located within
the community—there are multiple ‘classes’ within the wider
open-technology community—and holds that CoCs [Codes of Conduct] may do
some work to raise awareness and empathy levels about these differing
backgrounds and experiences.”

</blockquote>
<p>Rather than thinking we are above others mistakes, thereyb repeating
them, we can acknowledge and address difference and power, and hopefully
begin to build better practices in the communities we form. As we all
move across multiple communities, this may also help reshape more rigid,
formal, or corporate communities as well.</p>
</section>
<section id="see-differences-as-potentials" class="level2">
<h2>See differences as potentials</h2>
<p>Aligned in our interest in coding, we see our many differences as
strengths and opportunities to learn from one another. I am committed to
interdisciplinary, intersectional, iterative making. I make sure this is
embedded in my artistic practice and my own work; and I hope it extends
into our gatherings by how we show up. We including workshops and
research discusses on algorithmic bias and other issues in computation
that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally. We focus on
how to “read” tools and technologies we use and make from different
perspectives.</p>
<p>Sometimes these values are explicitly stated. At other times, such
language can be off-putting to audiences who might otherwise want to
participate and would gain from the ideas that language describes. It’s
not always necessary to use the terms “intersectionality” or “queer
theory” — we can continue enacting these ideas through our selection of
tools, programming languages, social gestures, and more.</p>

<p>Just as it’s not always necessary to explain complex digital systems
in highly technical terms, or critical theory in highly academic terms,
we can use plain language to include as many interdisciplinary
communities in the topics of our conversation as possible.</p>
<p>Jus as we want to meet people at their skill level, we also want to
meet them at their interest level and topic of choice. Accept that it is
not your job to change someone else’s focus or opinion, especially about
their own work. Practice giving feedback that is a value-neutral
description of what you see in their work, rather than what’s ‘good’ or
‘bad’, or what you like or dislike <span class="citation"
data-cites="springerSyllabusENGL8A2015">(<strong>springerSyllabusENGL8A2015?</strong>)</span>.
This can often be the most helpful feedback, as it reflects back to the
creator how it is received by an audience and leaves to them whether it
meets their goals.</p>
<p>I may not relate to their approach or their aesthetic — or their
politics! But I still <em>try</em> to start by understanding what they
want to make and why.<span

fundamental humanity and right to exist of others.<br />
<br />
</span></span> I do ask questions intended to challenge those approaches
and aesthetics (and sometimes politics), but my goal is not to change
their mind or make them do it ‘my’ way. My goal is to make space for
them to see options they might not have considered, and to help them
explore the options they choose in mindful ways.</p>
<p>This approach helps more people feel welcome in our meetups. Often it
also shifts their stance and their practice in the direction of making
more critical and compassionate work, because it models for others the
questions they can ask themselves about their own practice.</p>
<p>If someone comes in with an opposing idea, let’s talk about it. Tell
us what’s interesting to you about that. Show us how you’re thinking
about that. Maybe we disagree, but we’re interested to know where you’re
coming from. We can hold space for multiple opposing ideas. This
approach is somewhere between scrappy “dialectics” (dialogue and
questioning) and “negative capability” (staying with uncertainties and
doubts, without reaching for answers).</p>
<p>And find a way, in the end, to break it up — with snacks, goofing
off, small glimmers of joy — so that discussion fatigue does not set in.
This makes it a comfortable space to have hard, but generative
conversations.</p>

“I can see Code Collective as a way to reinforce ethics — and without
imposing them. It has actively shaped the ethics of individuals who have
exceptional power with their work. It was never like, ‘don’t do that,
what are you doing’ but definitely a space to hold all the possibilities
around it, which I really appreciate. I know you and I have gotten into
some heated conversations which I really enjoy. But there’s a lot of

value.”

<h2>Choose the right tool for the job</h2>
<p>There are no “right” tools or “best” programming langages. There are
only right tools for the particular job. What do you want to say with
what you make? What form will you use to make it? What tools will you
use to create that form?</p>
<p>I think of content as a liquid — its shape is determined by the form
it fills. I started writing code because I wanted to make forms, because
I wanted new shapes and thus new possibilities for content.</p>
<p>What we can form also depends on the capabilities of the tools we use
— the programming languages, applications, hardware we choose. The
capacities of the tools we choose set the limits for our capacities to
create. If I choose a saw, I may be able to build a birdhouse but won’t
be able to write an essay (maybe an essay about saws?). Carefully choose
tools and forms that share the values you want your work to embody.</p>

“It’s very hard to get people out of their professional communities and
their tool communities. It tends to get very siloed very quickly. And I
haven’t seen a good community to participate in that is both specific
enough to be useful and general enough to be interesting. […] It’s not
about the craft of a website or the craft of a Python analytics system.
It’s about the craft of creating something with code that can span all
of these boundaries. And you don’t really get a wide conversation about
those sorts of things. […But if] somebody’s coming from a different
language, and they say, ‘Does this language have that tool?’ You can
pick and choose in a more informed way by having this language-agnostic
discussion about code.”

adapted shape to embrace them all, as members found common interests and

great! Are you like me and the idea of a “minimum viable product” sparks
no joy, but you can see the whole constellation of an idea writ large?
Are you you are easily distracted by a technological tangent or research
rabbit hole? Same. In Code Collective, we have found that letting
ourselves follow these pulls toward the large and small are generative
endeavors, even if they do not seem productive. They may not feel useful
in the moment, but eventually they even help us arrive at more
realistically scaled versions of our ideas.</p>
<p>Try not to dismiss ideas before they get off the ground. Everything

software engineering. It is quite common for academic researchers not to
know in advance what the result of their project will be, and to
approach programming as an experiment rather than a contractual
construction project. This is as it should be, of course! We want
researchers to do original things rather than simply follow someone
else’s instructions.”

<h2>Critical dreaming</h2>
<p>We love to dream wildly. We’ll figure out the impractical later and
the impossible after that. Scaling down can come later. The practice of
critical dreaming can get us where we need to go by overshooting so
vastly we end up somewhere new. Perhaps we’d never have arrived here by
the normal routes.</p>
<p>Those gargantuan ideas, the ones you’d have no idea where to start?
Go ahead and sketch the whole thing out — on paper, in plain language or
pseudo code, in stick figures and scribbles. Make a map of your wild
idea. For the areas where you have absolutely no clue what belongs
there, you can write “Here be dragons” and fill it in later with the
help of others. The map will help them, and you, understand what you
don’t yet understand. It will also help you see how you might break this
big idea into smaller parts that could be doable — or at least a bit
more comprehensible, and maybe one of the parts of those parts you know
how to start. Start anywhere, and go from there!</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/ladymouthchart-marked.png" /></p>
<p>For example, here’s a map I made of my first Python project, called
<em>ladymouth</em>. When I made the map, it did not yet include all
these parts (almost none, in fact). As I learned what I would need to
make it operate the way I imagined, I was able to start coding each
part. I ended up building only portions of the work, but this map helped
me understand where I <em>could</em> go if I wanted to. It also helped
me understand that I didn’t have to try to do everything at once (which
is a tendency of mine).</p>
<p>Also, note that map was made after I had built maybe a quarter of
what I hoped the project would include. If I had made the map at the
very start of the project, it would have had a lot more “?!?!” and “Here
be dragons” on it — so don’t worry if you don’t know what terms or
shapes your map should have, or what tools you’ll come to use. Describe
as best you can, just to get something down. When mapping an exhibition
I would go on to create, I didn’t know what would go in the center of
the room and drew a large swirling spiral, saying “something amazing
should happen here, but what?” because I had no idea! A few months
later, surprise!, I ended up placing a very spiral-like labyrinth in the
middle of the room.</p>
<p>How do you practice dreaming <em>critically</em>?</p>
<p>Momentarily setting aside your doubts and questions, what would you
make if you could make anything? And <em>why</em>? Focusing on the
reasons you want to make, and why something should or shouldn’t exist,
is an incredibly important aspect of development that often gets missed.
It might be as simple as, “I feel it in my bones.” See if you can stay
with that feeling to find more language for it. What does that feeling
feel like, and what does that need need to tell you?</p>
<p>Articulating that dream with as much detail as possible does several
cool things. First, it already makes it more real. Second, it makes
clear more paths, strategies, and shapes by which it could exist. Third,
imagining things as we would like them to be, and imagining means to
realize those things in the here and now, are the first steps of
[revolution/prefigurative practice].</p>
<p>A critical dreaming practice may help you recognize your <a
href="#move-toward-the-weird">research tensions</a>, the topics that you
feel invested in making work about, asking questions (you might not
solve) about, and continually exploring through code and other
materials.</p>

<section id="critical-tinkering" class="level2">
<h2>Critical tinkering</h2>
<p>We find small things to get excited about and explore them right
away. We feed off each others’ enthusiasm. We love a tangent, too. Who
knew we’d find ourselves in any given Code Collective meetup tinkering
together on <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">interpreters</a>
or <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">shaders</a>? Those tiny
charming tasks that draw us away from “the real work”? The ones in which
you realize you’ve just spent three hours learning how to <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEnRpy9Xfes">format CSS grids</a>
for seemingly no reason or deepdiving into <a
href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/">histories of cyberfeminism</a>?
Inevitably they reappear, whether in this project or years later, so
trust your wandering urges (at least until you’re on deadline).</p>
<p>These small things are seeds. We don’t know what they might grow
into, but we trust they will grow:</p>
<blockquote>
“Everything small and buried surrenders to a process that none of the
buried parts can see.”
<footer>
–Mark Nepo, <em>The Book of Awakening</em>

</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes these small tangents turn into the coolest things you’d
never expect. Trust that they will (eventually) circle back and relate
to the bigger things you are investigating. Follow that rabbit down the
hole!</p>
<p>How do you practice tinkering <em>critically</em>?</p>
<p>Again, foreground the question <em>Why?</em> Get curious, not only
about “Why am I doing this,” which you can temporarily set aside in the
tinkering phase, but moreso “Why does this tool or system work this
way?” Ask ‘why’ and ‘how’ something is made. Where does it come from?
Who created it? For what reasons? In what broader contexts?
Understanding the underpinnings of your materials helps connect the
aesthetics and textures of tinkering with those materials’ politics and
your personal stakes.</p>
</section>
<section id="trust-yourself" class="level2">
<h2>Trust yourself</h2>
<p>Do you know that sneaky feeling an idea should already exist? It
might mean you are just the person to create it. Or that other sneaky
feeling that an idea is too impossibly far-fetched, that you are the
only one who would want it? That <em>still</em> might mean you should
pursue it.</p>
<p>Making for yourself is also an offering to others. If the tool,
resource, artwork, space, or widget you wish for does not exist, create
it!</p>
<p>This part is hard, but <em>trust</em> that if you’re interested in
something, others will be too. If you are wishing for it, someone else
is too. We are the people best suited to bring our own visions to life.
I started Code Collective because I was wishing for a community to share
my weird code struggles and joys with. This is how many communities get
started – <a

(now Resplendent Tonguesplitters)</a>, <a
href="https://monoskop.org/log/?p=269">Radical software</a> – all show
how a few folks with a wild idea can bloom into innovative ideas that
are appreciated by many, many people.</p>

<p>When I first started my first Python programming project, I had an
idea to make a chatbot that would try to explain feminism to online
misogynists, performing that labor (as a farce) so that I would not have
to. I looked around to see who had already made this, convinced it was a
simple idea that would already exist. When I could not find any
examples, I knew this idea needed to exist, which meant 1) I was the
person who needed to realize it (scary!) and 2) finally motivated me to
learn to program (making it a lot more interesting and fun, because I
had a mission!).</p>
</section>
<section id="make-to-inquire" class="level2">
<h2>Make to inquire</h2>
<p>While you’re asking ‘what’ you want to make, also ask ‘why’ and ‘how’
you want to make. Why do you want these coded gestures in the world, and
how do you want them to affect it?</p>
<p>I use code to think with, to investigate code itself and the world
around me. Nick Monfort calls this “programming as inquiry” <span
class="citation" data-cites="montfortExploratoryProgrammingArts2016">(–
Montfort 2016)</span>. I use code as one of my several mediums for
expression, thinking of it as both writing and craft. Understanding code
helps me decode the systems that use code to affect me, systems that
regulate how I and others are able to interact with the world. I code
because I refuse to be an outsider in the systems that injure or ignore
me and those I care about; I want to understand how those systems work,
how they do not work, so that I can imagine how to shift them.</p>
<blockquote>
“My goal is not just that students know how to code — you can find
coding tutorials anywhere that give you raw ‘stuff.’ […] code is
powerful and comes with responsibility, that there are social impacts to
what they program and that computer scientists are often the least
likely to recognize how impactful to society their job can be. These
skills […] are also valuable even for those who won’t go on to become
programmers.”

<p>Making asks through doing — about what concerns us, about how to
care, about how to live. Making is always a research question about how
to live. Through making, we ask how the world could be made
otherwise.</p>
<p>Ultimately I make coded things, written things, knitted and woven
things, in order to connect with others. I make in order to leap the
spark gaps of imperfect language and ephemeral feeling and the
impossibility of connection. I make things hoping someone recognizes a
familiar ache in them or thinks they’re kind of cool.</p>
<p>Why do you make things? What questions do you want to explore?</p>
<p><code>All making is a research question.</code></p>

<section id="cultivate-many-why-nots" class="level2">
<h2>Cultivate many ‘Why Nots’</h2>
<p>Critical engagement means asking ‘why not’ as well as ‘why’.</p>
<p>‘Why not?’ in critical dreaming is the space to let yourself spin
freely. Like in a brainstorming session, there are no ‘bad’ ideas.</p>
<p>But in the critical reflection phases that come after brainstorming,
‘why not?’ also means questioning what limits technologies impose. Does
an idea need to be realized with a machine learning tool, just because
that is the trend? Does it have to be made with a digital technology at
all? Is this a “problem” that technology is needed to solve?</p>
<p>There may be no ‘bad’ ideas, but all ideas have real-world stakes, so
choose wisely. In short, make sure you’re dreaming big and broadly,
while also considering implications and impacts.</p>

largely guided by that sense, which I think I otherwise probably
wouldn’t have developed without being part of a critical community of

</blockquote>
<p>Whatever rituals and habits you create, create them
<em>together</em>. This is essential. Ideally you develop these over
time, through feedback and informal habits and through formal work on
community agreements and mission. How you choose to move as a group
should be collaborations, ways of building trust with one another. As in
dance, and all forms of attunement, we respond to each others movements
in space, from the way we hold our bodies to the way we open ourselves
up (or don’t). And we learn what to trust and to expect by what is
repeated and what is dynamic.</p>
<p>These practices literally <em>make</em> the space we have together.
These repetitions create the containers and foundations where we can
both rest and risk. We help restore each other through co-presence. We
defrag each other’s mental hard disks through the process of communing.
And because we can restore and recouperate here, we also have more room
to experiment and create — playing at our growth edges, not cowering
under deadlines — supported by one another.</p>
<p>The examples I offer here are often in flux as the temperaments and
conditions of our members change. Often they start by accident and then
codify (code-ify!) into patterns we keep. They may seem like they have
nothing at all to do with coding. Don’t worry, the coding will happen.
First, we focus on creating ways of being together. We balance the
acknowledgment of our common humanity alongside our unique perspectives.
We mark the specialness of contact and connection. With this as our
steady base, it’s then easy to help folks engage topics they care about
— including coding. Try some of these, and adjust until you find what
works for you!</p>
</section>
<section id="meet-regularly" class="level2">
<h2>Meet regularly</h2>
<p>Meet weekly if possible, in person if possible, and accommodate
what’s not always possible. Aim for consistency and flexibility through
a mix of in-person meetings and online connection if possible. Stay
flexible to the impossible and know you’ll get back to it later. Like
old friends you can pick up with after an indeterminate amount of time,
no questions asked. Or old code that needs a break from you after
troubleshooting for too long. Trust that you can come back together,
without pressure or resentment or guilt. It’s not meant to be another
obligation on the calendar, but a reprieve.</p>
<p>A frequent, consistent cadence of meeting in person is best. But the
truth is, you don’t need to prepare much just to start building
community. Our own weekly meeting cadence went to video during pandemic
lockdowns, to hybrid and bi-weekly, and has been consistently
supplemented by a Discord forum where we post asynchronously.</p>
<p>We’ve been lucky to have space to be self-selecting participants,
figuring out what this is together. People find us by word of mouth, no
prostheletizing (we’re too lazy for that). We simply have our meetings
in a semi-public space like a library lab. People can walk by and see
what we are doing, ask if they can join, and we’ve had long-time members
who found us this way. There are no prerequisites or fees. The
asynchronous forums allow us to include anyone else who is interested to
join, no matter their location or affiliation.</p>
<p>Still, it’s possible to incorporate some of these approaches in a
required classroom setting or work environment too. Or if you don’t have
a space, you can start with an online forum only.</p>

</figure>
<p>Start with a round of check-ins: <em>What are you making? What are
you into right now? How are you doing? No, really?</em></p>
<p>We are pretty free-form, but one of our adopted structures has been
to open with a ritual of checking in on each other, asking what we are
working on and thinking about. That short process often guides the rest
of our weekly agenda. It’s a quick moment to take the temperature of the
group, to find out what code questions need investigating or
troubleshooting (or what life questions too).</p>
<p>Call it Round Robin, Show and Tell, <a href="">Council Method</a>, or
Vibe Check — some version of an opening gesture for gathering helps to
acknowledge each person, and it gives them a couple of minutes to share
anything they want to share today. You could make it very abstract or
metaphorical as a warmup, like “What’s your internal weather report? And
what’s your code project’s weather report?” Or it could be quite
literal: “How are you feeling? What are you working on? What are you
struggling with or excited about? What’s something cool you’ve seen in
code this week?”</p>
<p>By the time we’ve completed the circle we almost always have a clear
trajectory for the rest of the day’s meetup and are well into our first
conversation or troubleshoot. We have also made room for each person,
whether they are shy and would otherwise be steamrolled, or whether they
would be first to speak and might otherwise take up most of the
time.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-room-for-each-other" class="level2">
<h2>Make room for each other</h2>
<p>We always set a timer for our check-ins. Depending on how many people
you have, make it just two to five minutes max! We do this not to limit
people but to make time for everyone. The timer also has a flattening
effect: A full professor who comes to the meetup gets the same three
minutes as a first-year undergraduate. Both of their interests are
equally valid and interesting in this space.</p>
<p>In Olivia Jack and Bruno Gola’s Berlin-based hack night, Show Us Your
Screens, everyone gets ten minutes to perform or present their
computational art or music [CITE]. This ten minutes includes setup time,
so plugging in becomes part of the show. “We project the timer on the
ceiling. When it goes off, you’re done. It changes color and everyone
claps,” says Jack, who is the creator of the <a href="">Hydra</a>
live-coding language for networked visuals. “The setup is sometimes the
most elaborate part of the performance.”</p>
<p>The time we offer each other matters. Sharing it with our active and
equal attention is one of the most generous things we can offer to one
another.</p>

Make sure you budget for snacks.</p>

<p>Look for snacks that are computer keyboard friendly – nothing too
sticky, no tipsy liquids. A mix of salty and sweet is good, a mix of
healthful and less-than-healthful. Throw in a few apples, I guess?
Single-serving items that avoid much plastic wrapping are ideal:
popcorn, pretzels, gummies, satsuma oranges. If you have a Trader Joes
in your area, we recommend the Sour Scandanavian Swimmers.</p>
<p>As our meetings transitioned to virtual spaces and across timezones,
snacks still held sway as a conversation starter. We switched to a BYOS
system, and built communality through sharing snacks on screen. Then, on
return to a campus strictly regulated with no-food policies and
mask-wearing, our beloved snacks were off the table (occasionally under
the table, instead). Whether piled in the center of the table, dutifully
taken outside, or discussed in their glaring absence, snacks always
represent the friendly core of the space (in much the same way the
liveliest room of a party is always the kitchen).</p>
<p>The snack breaks have been where the best thinking and connections
get made. They remind us that we are not coding machines but fleshy
bodies connected by our need to take breaks to digest and recharge. As
we chew and chat, we digest and discuss what we’re troubleshooting (both
in code and life). It’s all part of the processing.</p>
</section>
<section id="share-playlists" class="level2">
<h2>Share playlists</h2>
<p>Snacks are rivaled only by music and movement in the essentials for
our meetups. At our first gathering, we began a collaborative playlist
that always kicks off with Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now.” This track
became our theme song at our very first meetup, when I asked if folks
would like background music while we worked, and an otherwise very quiet
student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion. Perhaps
it seems out of character as a rallying cry for a room full of people
typing on computers, but I argue that it speaks to a Code Collective
mindset that finds joy in doing the impossible:</p>
<blockquote>
“Tonight I’m gonna have myself a real good time / I feel alive / And the
world, I’ll turn it inside out, yeah / I’m floating around in ecstasy /
So (Don’t stop me now) (Don’t stop me) / ’Cause I’m having a good time /
Having a good time / I’m a shooting star, leaping through the sky like a
tiger / Defying the laws of gravity / I’m a racing car, passing by like
Lady Godiva / I’m gonna go, go, go, there’s no stopping me”

and energizing background noise while you work, it’s another way to come
together around something <em>other</em> than code. Anything that makes
broader connections among participants can help support the community,
in general and when coding. It’s all connected!</p>

<section id="keep-things-loose" class="level2">
<h2>Keep things loose</h2>
<p><em>What’s the minimal structure necessary to make people feel like
they have a container that is safe, and that gives them freedom to move?
What’s the foundation you need to have to facilitate spaciousness while
still offering a foundation? You still need a a safe structure.</em></p>
<p>As Code Collective developed, the above has been an ongoing question.
It has been one of my biggest stresses about our collective learning how
to lead. Because leadership is a responsibility I take seriously, but
also feels like a spotlight or a pedestal I’m wary of, this leadership
feels like a tightrope walk in which I try nervously to make sure
everyone is comfortable, having fun, and learning — all without forcing
anything or having it “look like” anything is happening at all.</p>
<p>Of course, this does not work. That nervous strategy is riddled with
stilted efforts of over-structured efforts leading to dead silence and
loosey-goosey meandering conversations. Along the way I am continually
learning the caring practices of facilitation as leadership, as being a
vessel and a model.</p>
<p>The space is a loose net — some structure is in fact necessary,
though I was loathe to be the instigator of that structure at first. But
tangents are warmly encouraged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elea: “Can I go on a tangent?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah: “Always.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep it loose, but keep it. Strive for the loosest container possible
to hold the thing together. This supports the lowest possible barrier to
participation.<span

<p>When we were faced with formalizing into an organization with
officers and institutionalization in order to access funding, for us in
that moment it was right to turn that down. You’ll have to decide what’s
right for your group at the time, but our members said they liked being
able to stay low-stakes, without obligation. We were able to maintain
this way because of individual members like myself having institutional
support. In other contexts, this may change as our structure and
membership continues to change.</p>

<h2>Set guidelines together</h2>
<p>By making rituals together, making time for each other, asking after
each other, and so many more small things, we set the standards by which
we will treat each other implicitly. It is also important to make these
standards explicit, to make our expectations clear and unambiguous, so
that we can adjust them to meet the needs of each person involved and so
that community members both new and old can understand how we have
agreed to maintain our shared space.</p>

<h1>9. We share resources</h1>
<section id="keep-track-of-what-you-already-know" class="level2">
<h2>Keep track of what you already know</h2>
<p>Finding a free and open way to share information with one another is
essential. This helps reinforce that
<code>we all have something to teach each other</code> by holding space
for what we know. Whether you make a wiki, or cover the wall in sticky
notes, or use the latest sharing platforms all synched up to your
phones, there are many ways you can keep track of and share the vast
collective knowledge of your group:</p>
<ul>
<li>collaboratively notetaking during meetups in a shared etherpad or
team doc</li>
<li>posting your individual code sketches or finished projects on a
group github</li>
<li>creating a project showcase as a public event or digital
experience</li>
<li>making a resource hub or group wiki – include readings, tutorials,
anything you’ve found useful</li>
<li>starting a website together, for others to find your group</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="value-documentation" class="level2">
<h2>Value documentation</h2>
<p>Remember to try a few types of documentation from different creators
(video, textbooks, example code) and a few different tools, too, before
you give up in defeat. Different languages and tools work different ways
and accomplish different goals. Plus, different creators will explain
how they work… differently!</p>
<p>Documentation is hard work, care work, necessary work, code work. It
is an integral part of the real work of programming, despite being
systematically devalued in open-source software production along with
other important parts of coding like outreach and community management
(according to extensive research by communications professor Christina
Dunbar-Hester).</p>
<p>If you’re writing code, don’t skimp on documentation — both for your
future self and your coding collegues! Documenting does not have to be a
formal or stressful; make it an integrated part of your community
processes.</p>
<p>Your documentation can be friendly and fun to read. Imagine your
documentation audience as a younger version of yourself, eager to know
what you now know. How did you get here? What would be important for
them to understand about what you’ve done in order to replicate it? What
‘gotchas’ and assumptions can you help them avoid? Don’t take for
granted what might feel intuitive to you.</p>
<p>Your documentation may be easiest to write if you compile it as a
diary of your process along the way. Keep a <code>README.md</code> file
open alongside your working code and make note each day of where you
start and stop, what problems you encounter and solve, any libraries and
tutorials you use, plus whether they work or not. Include links to
resources and wild ideas. You can clean these notes up later for a
general public or keep them for your own reference.<span

<p>For examples of good documentation, I looked to models like the
Processing and P5.js community that puts emphasis on access and
connecting new coders with approachable information in multiple mediums.
Check out the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki">P5.js
wiki</a>, which includes a guide for new contributors as well as
tutorials for beginning and intermediate projects. Another great example
of documentation is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">The
Rust Programming Language Book</a>, which walks you step-by-step through
learning an entire coding language, with thoughtful explanations along
the way.</p>

<section id="document-the-obvious" class="level2">
<h2>Document the obvious</h2>
<p>Document what you want to remember, but also document what you value
about what you’re making. Especially document what you think seems too
obvious to document. They feel “too obvious” because you have lived with
them for a long time, but they won’t be so obvious to others who don’t
think like you do. Value how you think and include these “obvious”
suggestsions, as they may be just the key to help others understand some
aspect of your work.</p>
<p>As Code Collective members relocate, graduate, change jobs, spread
out into the world, I’m working to document our processes and values
with this pocket guide. Hopefully, this documentation helps us continue
to take on new shapes, as we expand beyond our initial institution —
welcoming members via Discord, starting new chapters at other
universities in other cities.</p>
<p>By documenting our approaches, I don’t intend to take sole credit for
them or label them as novel; in fact, most feel so instinctual they are
easily dismissed — but they are too important to be overlooked, when
they contribute so much to learning environments that support a variety
of expression and creation.</p>
</section>
<section id="minimal-is-accessible" class="level2">
<h2>Minimal is accessible</h2>
<p>Sometimes the low-fi answer is the right one. Sometimes no tech is
needed at all. If you opt for “minimum viable product” in any aspect of
your projects (see <a
href="#get-excited-about-impossibly-large-possibilities-and-impressively-tiny-ideas">Section
7</a>), make it here in your documentation (so that you actually do
it).</p>
<p>The lower the barrier the entry the better. There’s always a tension
between how structured or unstructured to make your systems for
documenting, just like your systems for gathering. You need enough
structure so that folks know where to find things and add things, but
not not so much structure that they can’t imagine new things that don’t
fit the existing form.</p>
<p>Our now-elaborate Resource Hub started as simple shared document
where anyone could toss in a link. We made a basic google team drive and
gathered a disorganized collection of links to tutorials and cool
projects, some collaborative meeting notes, and called it a Hub. Ooooh,
a Hub!</p>
<p>This worked at first because we could start instantly and informally,
and everyone had access without any hurdles or instructions. Even though
ideally we look to open-source tools and custom solutions, sometimes the
big box corporate google doc is what’s needed — for a particular
audience or for your internal prototyping. What’s great about a shared
doc (despite its many issues) is that most folks are quickly able to
jump in. That low barrier to entry is perfect for spinning up resources
quickly and collaboratively.</p>
<blockquote>
“we wanted to offer an open resource focused on free offerings with a
global reach that could be maintained by creatives themselves. Starting
from an open call and a tweet asking for help, the kit’s contents were
compiled by 30 curators and countless unnamed contributors worldwide,
who came to it from across the arts, technology, community, academia,
and gig work.”

<p>Kit Braybrooke chose to work in a shared doc when making the COVID
Creatives Toolkit because of “the difficulties of trying to engage with
any kind of new or more interesting platform as the internet is
increasingly enclosed” <span class="citation"
data-cites="braybrookeTogetherWeDance2020">(– Braybrooke 2020)</span>.
While an etherpad on a self-hosted server may be preferred (we love the
setup by <a href="https://etherdump.vvvvvvaria.org/">Varia</a>), don’t
worry if a google doc is the right choice for a particular project,
audience, or prototype. The important thing is to get started.</p>
<p>Minimal choices support different purposes. They sometimes offer more
access, or keep the information more legible and adaptable for friends
who might want to interact with it later, or for us if we build or
rebuild it one day.</p>
<p>I am inspired by examples like <a
href="https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing</a>, theorized
by a digital humanities working group as an accessible, aesthetic, and
political value enacted through lean tech configurations <span
class="citation" data-cites="lisonMinimalComputing2022">(Lison

href="https://www.schoolofcommons.org/labs/minimum-viable-learning">minimum
viable learning</a>, theorized by the collective varia as an approach in
which “minimal, frugal solutions can prove more effective than hi-tech,
hi-bandwidth, baroque ones” and can “maximize a learning experience”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="MinimumViableLearning">(<span>“Minimum Viable Learning –

using simple documents before complex databases, and foregrounding
access.</p>

<section id="let-things-accumulate" class="level2">
<h2>Let things accumulate</h2>
<p>Minimal can grow, of course! The Code Collective Resource Hub has had
many versions since its long list of links. The Hub idea expanded into
its own group project. We spent many hours troubleshooting as a group to
bring it to life, with Katherine Yang shaping its innovative form. It
came to represent our group identity, our way of working, and our
approach to sharing information too. This evolution was part of our
process to define what kinds of resources we wanted to share and
how.</p>
<p>When searching for the right tools to build out the Code Collective
Resource Hub as a more robust tool, we went through every possible
solution for a database… and landed on a google sheet (minimal is still
accesible). When looking for ways to build the website, again we went
through what seemed like endless possibilities for platforms, and landed
back at simple JAMstack static site on github pages (the <a
href="https://creativecodecollective.com/resource-hub/">Resource Hub</a>
can point you to tutorials for this!).</p>
<p>Now the Resource Hub has grown into a full-fledged, searchable
database. Anyone can contribute a resource that they’ve found useful,
and can search by keywords from technical skills to critical concepts or
random combinations thereof as a creative provocation. The Resource Hub
has a unique blend of critical and creative resources and a “remix-able”
feel.</p>

<!-- ![](assets/img/ofmd-favorite.gif) --></p>
<p>Thinking and making always happen in community, and our creations
reflect these communities. When citing, try to cite generously and
often.</p>
<p>Citation is a means of [announcing/putting forward] the people you
are thinking with and responding to. It is placing yourself in
conversation and in community with them. As such, citation has a
politics. I cite to celebrate the work of those who inspire what I
do.</p>
<p>Citation is about much more than including references at the top of
your code or the bottom of your essay, of course. We can use the whole
of what we make (not only the citations) as a way to share what we’ve
learned along the way. This may be in the work itself, or through
archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, zines, or other
documentation. Whether you’re sharing about another person’s practice or
consciously curating or remixing, all of this counts as citation.</p>
<p>Consider who you are citing. Do you always reference the same five
authors and creators, from the same part of the world? Are they all just
citing each other? How might you expand your readings and reference
points to include broader communities of practice?</p>

<p>In the Resource Hub and in our projects, we emphasize open-source and
open-access tools. We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable,
minimal tools that don’t hide how they work. Such tools match the way we
like to reflect critically on what we are creating and to understand the
world around us.</p>
<p>Just as you might consider which texts and tutorials you select to
cite, consider which tools you select to work with, too. It may seem
abstract to think about the business model of a tool like ChatGPT while
you’re asking it for code solutions, but consider how any software or
service will be shaped by its creators’ perspectives. From interface to
source code to datasets, choices are made by designers of each tool that
will determine how those tools are used and for what goals — making some
tasks easier, and some harder.</p>

</figure>
<p>Did you know that many teapots in Japan are made for pouring with
only the right hand? I found this out when I tried to buy a side-handled
kyūsu teapot for a left-handed friend. Because for decades the statewide
policy had been to make left-handed people learn to be right-handed in
school, there “were no” left-handed people, so why design a left-handed
teapot? This unweildy metaphor shows how the values of a country, or a
company, end up embedded in the tools we use, in almost invisible but
ubiquitous ways.</p>
<p>Open-source and open-access tools, in theory, allow more opportunity
for us to view, understand, and potentially alter or adapt the tools to
new purposes. Choose carefully, of course. Some open-source projects are
‘open’ in name only, using the branding of open-source to draw good will
while not enacting the open-source values of transparency, community,
and share alike. OpenAI is the most prominent example of this, as a
company that began creating machine learning models that offered
research access but has increasingly become closed and proprietary.
Elsewhere, I have written about open-source works which do nothing more
than place a single version of their source code online — in contrast to
robust, responsive open-source projects that develop their work over
multiple versions in consultation with their communities. Code
Collective’s Elea Zhong has written that, not only do large corporate
entities claiming to be open source often fail to offer substantive
contributions to open-source communities, they misuse the term ‘open
source’ to extort free labor:</p>
<blockquote>
“In the same way big oil brands itself with greenwashing for illusory
environmental progressiveness, big tech extol their open source efforts
to open-wash their capitalist, monopolistic, and destructive reality.
Technological development is in dire need for a policy-first,
documentation-first, ideology-first methodology, and AI must transform
its focus on creating systems which understands and addresses the
complexity of its environment, critically assesses its context, and
produces meaning-rich results.”

<!-- Machine unlearning ([ender 2023](https://www.enderverse.org/notes/unlearning.html)) points out that 
The new task in machine learning called 'machine unlearning' has emerged due to large models' training costs and the practice of indiscrimine data scraping. As Code Collective member ender writes, machine unlearning assumes access to the models it wants to alter, which also assumes a powerful role with agency in big tech. Instead, ender combines questions of machine unlearning with adversarial data poisoning to ask how one can remove data from a model without access to the initial model.  -->
<p>When choosing a tool to use, you might ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who makes it? What else have they made? Who pays for it?</li>
<li>Is it being visibly maintained? Is the documentation helpful?</li>
<li>Does it have a community around it I can ask if I get stuck?</li>
<li>Is the tool itself flexible? Can I use part of it, connect it
another tool, or adapt it to my purposes?</li>
<li>What is the license? Does it allow me to use it for share-alike or
commercial purposes?</li>
<li>What other tools are like it, and how do they compare?</li>

<h2><span class="emoji" data-emoji="notebook">📓</span> PLAY ALONG:
README.please?</h2>
<p>This is a two-part exercise about documenting your code and sharing
it. You’ll be sharing a project with a partner and you’ll be creating
documentation to make it easier for them to understand the project, run
it, or potentially fork it (duplicate it and adapt it).</p>
<p>Note: If you don’t have time for doing both parts of this exercise,
you can just do one or the other.</p>
<p>To get started, pair up with a partner and each pick a code project
that you’d like to document and to swap. It doesn’t have to be ready for
final release, but it helps if it is far enough along that someone else
could run your code. (If it’s still in the development stages, you can
just think in the future tense. Imagine what you want your code to do
and how your user will do it.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a README.md and write documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Look over the code you’ve written and any pre-existing documentation
or notes you have. Make a blank file in the project folder called
<code>README.md</code> if you don’t already have one. Explain to your
future user (and partner) what your program does, how they should run
it, and any gotchas. Think about other good documentation you have seen.
What did theirs include? How do you imagine your audience and what they
need to know?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Swap code and explore your partner’s work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Read the documentation of the project you’re encountering for the
first time. Make notes of anything you don’t understand and any
questions that come up for you. * Do you understand what this work does
and why? * Do you know what language it is written in and what libraries
are required to run it? Does it need installing? * Explore how the files
are organized. Is everything clearly where you’d expect? Is anything
missing? * Do you know how to get started? What happens when you run the
program?</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Discuss: Once you’ve drafted some documentation and tried to use
each other’s code with the help of documentation, what do you notice?
How did your approaches to documentation differ? Did what your partner
suggest surprise you? Do you struggle with the same aspects of
documentation? Where can you help each other through the process? How
does swapping help you understand how your code is read differently by
those other than yourself?</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Many people struggle to write documentation for their own
projects. You can actually do parts 1 and 2 of the exercise in either
order! Try having your partner draft your documentation to the extent
that they understand what’s happening, then give it back to you to fill
in the gaps. Or try writing the documentation the best you can, then
have your partner try it out.</p>

<p>Care and compassion are infinite but neglected resources. They are
literally life sustaining resources that renew themselves with use.</p>
<p>Community organizer and designer Rachel Simanjuntak, co-creator of
Tiny Tech Zines, frames “care as artistic practice” — meaning that how
she interacts with others becomes an essential component of her creative
life. Just as documentation is a key part of the work of programming,
making care part of the practice of programming takes a more holistic
view of what it means to ‘be a coder’ (or a citizen or a human), while
acknowledging the whole, messy, interconnected humans we are and why we
make creative–critical code.</p>
<p>Care makes us curious about what each person needs in order to
thrive, whether that may be technical resources, access support, various
learning modalities, a welcoming space to play, snacks, or something
else. By foregrounding care, we don’t have to cut short what code or
coding spaces might produce because we think we already know how they
are meant to work. We don’t have to say, “That’s not what code is for.”
We also don’t end up presuming we know what a hacklab or a tech space
looks like, nor what a tech person looks like.</p>
<p>Building community spaces for coding that focus on care first will
allow coding and everything else to happen more generously and more
fruitfully next. I have learned that

<p>How can we be together in ways that don’t feel protracted and
forced?</p>
<p>Community can sometimes feel like too easy a word, even a dirty word,
for the way it gets lobbed about by not-always-well-meaning folks who
might be making a lot of presumptions when they try to argue “we’re all
in this together.” Sometimes we’re not actually in this together.
Sometimes we are not a “we” at all. In past experiences, you or those
you know may have been put off or harmed by that kind of co-opted
language, and so it makes sense to limit our trust to those who earn it.
It makes sense to use terms like ‘community’ with a sense of
caution.</p>
<blockquote>
“Just because we are in the room together does not mean that we belong
to the room or each other: belonging is a speciﬁc genre of affect,
history, and political mediation that cannot be presumed and is, indeed,
a relation whose evidence and terms are always being contested.
Belonging is a proposition, a theory, a forensic fact, and a name for a
kind of attachment.”

<p>Belonging is hard. Community is hard work. “Real relationships make
it harder to waste each other’s time,” says adrienne maree brown. This
is because we return to them again and again. Real community comes from
solidarity across difference, not the simple request to assimilate. It
is about mutual interrelation and inter-reliance, not extraction. In
Code Collective, we learn from each other and our skills improve because
of each other, but we continually realize this is not the only — or even
the primary — reason we gather. We have grown excited to know each other
and to care for one another as people, not as a means to an end. The joy
that comes from seeing each other regularly begins to match, or even
exceed, the joy we experience from coding together.</p>

risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</p>
<p>Now that we have met up for several years now, we have come to trust
each other with ongoing care. We have revealed ourselves, perhaps slowly
at first. By sharing the things we make or want to make, we also share
what we care about, who we care for and how, our values and politics. We
glimpse of each others homes and families and pets. We see each other
chew with our mouths full, see each other arrive sweaty or sad or
frustrated. We see each other evolve as our interests grow and change,
influenced by each other. With each other’s support, we continue
becoming more ourselves.</p>

<h2>Stick with the essentials</h2>
<p>What are the building blocks or the core components of a community
like this one? What are the minimum foundations needed to support the
space, to let people grow their craft in their own way, to let them
flexibly flourish?</p>
<p>I have found an <code>adaptive learning mindset</code> to be more
broadly essential than any other specific skill. Knowing how to (or
rather, feeling permission to) pick up an unfamiliar tool, or find
resources for a new project, or create a new tool if it does not exists,
or pose questions critically and solve problems creatively — these are
skills I can carry forward into absolutely any undertaking.</p>
<p>Maintaining that mindset can be supported by a few small, quick, and
easy gestures that through repetition run deep and wide. Incorporate and
adapt them intuitively or adopt your own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steady cadence and rituals of gathering</li>
<li>Material care and basic physical resources</li>
<li>Inclusive, inquisitive, recursive approaches</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing hub and community identity</li>
</ul>
<p>Code Collective — as a community of people and as a practice of
communing and coding — positions itself within an
<code>ethics of coding care</code>. It is grounded by shared embodied
knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community.
The essential material aspects that support this ethic, listed above,
allow us to express those ethics through [the workings of the community
and its outputs]. Here are some key components of an ethics of coding
care as I see them.</p>
<p><code>An ethics of coding care values the...</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Scrappy:</code> Imperfect, iterative, vulnerable.</li>
<li><code>Collaborative:</code> Co-teaching and co-learning, embedded
and situated, accounting for hierarchy, with and for community.</li>
<li><code>Adaptive:</code> Meeting people where they are, with the
material and experiences they have.</li>
<li><code>Entangled:</code> Merging critical, theoretical, political
stakes and vulnerable topics with material, technical chops and hands-on
practices. Choosing and sharing tools that are ethically and
conceptually grounded.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pocket guide has argued for technology communities that support
pluralism, participation, and sustainability. As Annette Vee says,
coding is now an essential literacy, even reshaping literacy itself

<h2>LIVE CODE: Write your values, imagine your community</h2>
<section id="collective-imagination" class="level3">
<h3>Collective imagination</h3>
<p>First and foremost, codes of conduct are exercises in collective
imagination.</p>
<p>A code of conduct or community agreement does not have to feel
restrictive. If you’re thinking about it that way, of course it’s going
to feel like a bummer. Instead, remember that all communities have
community guidelines, whether spoken or unspoken. They help us
understand what is expected of us as we enter, join, and participate.
They set the tone for what we imagine this community to be, what we want
it to become, and who can feel welcome. Articulating your values should
ideally happen as a group exercise. It can be one of the most important,
rewarding, challenging, and generative experiences you may do
together.</p>
<p>Think about other communities you are part of or have witnessed, from
all parts of your life. What do they do that makes you feel good, safe,
cared for, able to speak and share, able to participate? How do they do
these things, practically?</p>
<p>Below is a broadly conceived list of community agreements that I use
as a template when I am working with Code Collective and when I am
teaching in new spaces. I offer it as a baseline when I am leading in
new spaces, with the suggestion that we can build on this as we go, and
I offer it here with the same intention for you. You’ll see it cites and
weaves together many other codes of conduct and guidelines, from
different kinds of groups.</p>
<p>As you reflect on what you’d like your own community agreements to
include, as you review this list, or as you review your existing
agreements, gather with your community to ask the following
questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Which agreements speak to you most?</li>
<li>Which surprise you?</li>
<li>Which are you good at?</li>
<li>Which are hard for you?</li>
<li>What are you/we doing well already?</li>
<li>How would you reword or add to any of these agreements? Would you
combine, remove, or reorder any?</li>
<li>What’s missing or needed?

<!-- First and foremost, we recognize that we are not perfect, and that we all stumble and have not and will not get them all right all the time. We are all growing.[^ts]

We agree to learn and grow and do our best at the following. This is not to be used as a weapon or to shame one another, but as a guide to look to when something doesn’t feel right.[^ts] -->
<ul>
<li>growth not perfection.</li>
<li>collaboration not competition.</li>
<li>listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be
brief.</li>
<li>assume best intent and attend to impact.</li>
<li>attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
<li>accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends
when we are wrong.</li>
<li>take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality).</li>
<li>center care — self care and community care.</li>
<li>all theory, all practice are theory–practice. interdisciplinarity
goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality.</li>
<li>focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than
problems.</li>
<li>don’t dispute anyone’s fundamental human rights. engage tension, but
don’t indulge drama. #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter
#indigenouslivesmatter</li>
<li>use these agreements for growth not shame.</li>
<li>ask for help and help one another. we are interdependent.</li>

guide — including some of the books I relied on most while writing,
essentials like our community agreement, plus some of the bits and
pieces that got us started from lesson plans to the first proposal for
Code Collective. For lots more tutorials, readings, and inspiration, you
can also head over to the <a

There's a disconnect between what academics say the world is going to be like and how they're making all this progress and the world that we see around us. That is the result of all those decades of quote unquote progress. And it's like, when you want to actually address these contradictions, you run into people who are very stubborn and don't actually want to take your argument in good faith. And they're just very stubborn techno-optimists, which is what I was trying not to go into. So like just the difference between techno-optimism, techno-pessimism and sort of just realism, like, what is the world that actually exists?" -->
<!-- "creative code collective looks at creative coding in a nuanced way that isn't overly optimistic or pessimistic, but just realistic, which may not sound like so beautiful and inspiring. But it it is actually quite refreshing when you know basically, no one wants to talk about the reality of what software is like." -->

"I decided to pursue my MA program because CCC opened me to the aesthetic and humanistic possibilities inherent in code that had nothing to do with instrumental goals that the usual CS student would attend to at their post-graduation gig. Now I’ve been working at the intersection of JavaScript and neuroscience for the last six years — sometimes as an independent developer, more recently as part of a larger institutional effort — and haven't once questioned the validity of this approach because the people at CCC would be proud to see it. So you could say CCC gave me the courage to pursue this alternative career path — and it's all pretty much worked out."

<!-- "in general it's very hard to get people out of their, you know, once they graduate out of their professional communities and their like tool communities, it starts to become like in the same way that academia is. It tends to get very siloed very quickly. And I haven't seen a good community to participate in. That is both specific enough to be useful and general enough to be interesting." -->
<!-- "it's not about the craft of a website or a craft of like Python analytics system. It's about the craft of creating something with code that can span all of these boundaries. And and again, you don't really get a wide conversation about those sorts of things. I mean, I'm even thinking, like, you know, you were saying, there's always gonna be a new Javascript library right? But somebody from Python is like, Well, why are these frameworks so crazy like there's a new one every day. And are they really that much better? Those sorts of questions don't really get asked unless you're looking outside of Javascript. I mean, people ask it, but they don't take it seriously, because it's just the water you drink in the air you breathe when you're a web developer, right? So those sorts of things are interesting or like, you know, somebody's coming from a different language. And they say, like, Does this language have that tool? It would be really cool or like You know what sort of capabilities you have, and [...] you can pick and choose in a more informed way by having this language-agnostic discussion about code." -->
<!-- ", because otherwise it's like, Well, I'm getting paid, you know, like $10,000 for this contract, like, what does it matter? You know?" -->
<!-- "people are just excited to share whatever they're involved in, and you get critical feedback back. but it's always warm. [...] you can't walk into a community like this and be turned off by warmth. unless you already know that what you're doing is wrong." "for me, working with all the brain technologies and coming in, there was some good questions raised around, What are we doing with the data and things like that. And again, it was all kind of probing in a curious sense. And I gave you answers, and I didn't know whether they were right or wrong, and so I wouldn't know that without actually talking. " -->
<!-- "if it happens at all, it always happens after hours like it's not a billable activity." [Critical ethical feedback and warmth] -->
<!-- "I went to a tech meetup [...] I brought up some some ethical concerns, and like resources and things like that and I think the investment was very low. but I cause I don't know if it was like the the Forum, or what, but like I didn't get a strong like immediate feedback that they were like going to follow up on this and do anything about it in a sense. -->
<!-- "whenever I come across really anybody learning the program even if they're had like Cs heavy, or want to go CS heavy. I go 'make make some art stuff like, just go like make some cool art stuff' cause like the graphics is like the graphics aspect was really compelling, more so than than like learning straight python. Like I really really loved working with, because it gave me this like familiarity with like a little bit of design. At least I was working with. I didn't even know that it was with Javascript at first. but again, I think even after that, I didn't. Really, it didn't click to me that was art or like that it like like I didn't know where it sat. And I was like, everybody else, is doing these like really cool, like things like, I'm just like trying to push like a square peg into a round hole. I don't get it, you know." -->
