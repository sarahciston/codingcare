<p>Pipi has arranged all the white things on the wall. All the white
things are sorted and inert, aesthetically unnerving but pleasingly so.
It is living as an algorithm to find and sort and display this way. I do
it too.</p>
<p>It seems merely rote to sort what will be important and what will not
be. But this is power. Here, on Pipi’s wall of white things, the
criteria may seem obvious: white, or white-enough.</p>
<p>But the not-quite-whiteness of what’s not here holds up this wall
with its exclusion.</p>

<p>This is about what is inside the black box, or moreso about what
shores up its walls. “Black box” is a thought experiment and a shorthand
for the unknown. No. Black box is presumed unknowable. It is enclosed as
if it doesn’t need knowing.</p>

<p>You say color is a feminist statement. Perhaps that explains others’
obsession with black boxes. People just love the idea that there is ‘no
way to know’ what’s inside. Like a black hole. Like a uterus. But a
black box is not a black hole. A black box should not be where you put
something you want to go away, something whose insides you want to
ignore.</p>
<p>Their viscera make systems. They are hungry for data. That virtual
assistant’s voice is the disembodied ghost of a sawed-in-half magician’s
assistant who never made it out of that black box. She still wants to
razzle-dazzle you, still wants to distract you.</p>
<p>Call it magic if you like.</p>
<p>Pipi, we are transfixed. We watch your videos lying down, touching
just at the tops of our heads and at our hands, our legs splayed out in
the museum’s ocean-floor dark. Pipi, your wicked game is riddled with
ocean plastic and makes me giggle inappropriately. Everything processed
through a black box will eventually sink to the bottom as indigestible
trash. At least with black holes nothing comes back out. <em>No
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII don’t wanna fall in love,</em> Pipi shrieks,
and I try to maintain the feeling that I do.</p>
<p>I was uneasy even then, but I didn’t listen. I misclassify my unease
as fizz. Misclassification gets me every time. I make room for multiple
meanings, a room for each meaning, like your staged rooms made too
lovely to be lived in. We move in. The two of us sit on Pipi’s sofa and
watch her boulder as if it is our TV. We move in like the pandemic will
only last six weeks.</p>
<p>At some point I get stuck, and I put everything I have so far into
the black box. This is what it outputs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to be in a box, a flower, a body. I want to be a tiny white
cube.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to be your body. I have a body. I have a body, a body that
lives. I have a body that is alive and belongs to me. I have a body. I’m
not even a woman. I’m not even a girl. I’m not even a girl. I’m a
body.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pipi, you are a box. You are a box of things. You are a box of words.
You are a box of letters. You are a box of images. You are a box of
feelings. You are a box of thoughts. You are a box of fantasies. You are
a box of bodies. You are a box of voices. You are a box of bodies. You
are a box of colors. You are a box of feelings. You are a box of bodies.
You are a box of words. You are a box of stories.</p>

<!-- What does this black box have to do with the white [room/cube] we are in? Its white refrigerator glow hat hums at a frequency I can feel in the bones of my skull. -->
<!-- Continually feeding the black box feels like standing in the white glow of the refrigerator cube past midnight even though I'm stuffed.  -->
<!-- I outsource analysis to the mawing void. I put my body in the shame space. -->
<!-- [What is it about Pipi's work that makes me think of black boxes, different kinds of intelligences?] -->
<p>I am writing again about bodies in boxes. The first black boxes held
memory, trauma, relation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“suppose I am in a friend’s house and, as a car goes past outside,
his dog rushes to a corner of the room and cringes. To me the behaviour
is causeless and inexplicable. Then my friend says, ‘He was run over by
a car six months ago.’ The behaviour is now accounted for by reference
to an event of six months ago. If we say that the dog shows ‘memory’ we
refer to much the same fact—that his behaviour can be explained, not by
reference to his state now but to what his state was six months ago. If
one is not careful one says that the dog ‘has’ memory, and then thinks
of the dog as having something, as he might have a patch of black
hair.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ‘black box’ first appears in W. Ross Ashby’s book <em>An
Introduction to Cybernetics</em> in 1956. For Ashby, black boxes are
like memory, an observed explanation, relational:
<!--Memory is not objective, but observed and relational, and -->“to
invoke ‘memory’ in a system as an explanation of its behaviour is
equivalent to declaring that one cannot observe the system completely”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="ashbyIntroductionCybernetics1956">(Ashby 1956)</span>.
<!--[For cybernetics, then, a system's memory explains current behavior that does not fit its homeostatic norms, except in relation to past trauma.][Jumping forward to today's large models, does that make the model a memory [bank/storage], and the memory is the [recaller/where you put past trauma.]--><!-- Why, in my mind, does Ashby's scene with the dog occur in my grandparents' house, where I never spent time? [Is it because they were both engineers?] --></p>
<p>In Ashby’s other colorful examples of black boxes, an engineer
examines a broken bomb sight, a small child learns to open a door, and
an object “has just fallen from a Flying Saucer” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ashbyIntroductionCybernetics1956">(Ashby 1956)</span>.
Bombs, children, animals, and aliens become the proving grounds where
current concepts of ‘artificial intelligence’ emerge. So much violence
is built in to the black box from the start. Ashby says, “we have in
fact been operating with Black Boxes all our lives,” and, “real objects
are in fact all Black Boxes” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ashbyIntroductionCybernetics1956">(Ashby 1956)</span>. All I
hear is trauma, trauma, trauma. Borders, borders, walls, walls.</p>
<!-- Are today's large models compounding 'memories' of past traumas? [Do they hallucinate new ones? The terms hallucinate, memory, trauma imply more agency than I'm ready to ascribe to these machines.] -->
<p>How does a model hold memory? I used to hold memory just like a black
box: act on it, try not to know what’s inside.</p>
<p>The first theft was ownership, and the first object of ownership was
the body, say Fred Moten and Stefano Harney. “Ownership was a feedback
loop. The more you own the more you own yourself.” They say the
enlightenment produced “a science of loss, which is to say the science
of whiteness, or, logistics” <span class="citation"
data-cites="harneyAllIncomplete2021">(Harney and Moten 2021)</span>.
Pipi, do you know this science? Were you raised on it like I was? Your
wall of white objects assures that everything is clean, pinned, silent,
plucked from its context.
<!--[I was also raised on this science.]--></p>
<!-- [arriving without/removed from its] context [without its routes]. -->
<!-- Don't know it, don't use it; don't change, don't hurt.  -->
<!-- Put it all in the black box. [Fred Moten and Stefano Harney on the legacies of [slavery-capital]:]  -->
<p>My father keeps everything so that he never loses anything. He never
uses anything so that it never breaks. He says, “Don’t own anything,
then you won’t have to move it.” He means, “Don’t love anything more
than it loves you.” His exact words are “The person who cares more
loses.” This is how I learned loss prevention. I learned early and it
stuck. I learned it did not work, but I practice it anyway. He says, “Do
as I say, not as I do.” But I don’t.</p>
<p>This is black box living, the refusal to know in any way that might
know you back.</p>
<p>I am trying to accept the risk of knowing. Let grief be a marker of
having known. Call this the difference between touching and holding.
Touching shares, holding clings. Touching undoes the body, loses the
self (or the illusion there ever was one). Touching textures you
back.</p>
<p>To make memory, take rubbings of surfaces. Press or rub one thing
against another thing, and whichever thing is harder transfers its
texture, making an impression in the softer thing. A pattern appears
only where they touch. And in return, the softer thing transfers its
particles, marking the harder thing back. This is a form of relief.</p>
<p>But rubbing also removes. My shower is a white cube where I rub the
skin to remove the skin. So much sloughs off. So much refuses.</p>
<p>The residual is what’s left. Between a prediction (an expected
result) and a prediction (a model’s output) is error. Error is measured
by various functions for ‘loss’. These loss functions tell you how wrong
you are, how far off your attempt.</p>
<p>Loss functions as an instructive, if you let it. “Each time my heart
is broken it makes me feel more adventurous,” says Frank O’Hara. I keep
practicing to let this be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“how we evade ownership/equilibrium is precisely in that refusal to
prevent loss we call sharing, rubbing, empathy, hapticality: the
undercommon love of flesh, our essential omnicentric or anacentric
eccentricity. Everything, in the wake of such disordering, is loss
prevention.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="harneyAllIncomplete2021">(Harney and Moten 2021)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What can be generated with/in this residual? In a “refusal to prevent
loss”?</p>
<p>In logistics, ‘loss’ refers to what is stolen and ‘prevention’ how to
get it back. Loss is ‘supply chain theft’ and is calculated as a cost.
To calculate loss is to tuck it away. How much loss is a rounding
error?</p>

<p>Instead of [my father’s black boxed] “don’t own anything, don’t love

<p>There are other kinds of boxes, besides monotone cube abstractions.
There are handcrafted cedar chests with dovetailed corners, with knitted

family.<!-- [, and their specific family smells]. There are gestures of care and contact. There are ways to keep warm.-->
Their carved joints splay out like tiny fans, so that they won’t require

<p>When I made my first project writing code, I made a chatbot called
‘ladymouth’ that tried to explain feminism to misogynists online <span
class="citation"
data-cites="cistonLadymouthAntiSocialMediaArt2019">(Ciston 2019)</span>.
I thought ladymouth would be like Pipilotti’s mouth, wet against the
glass — both mouthing silently into (and also itself becoming) a mawing
void. Like a sea of fish mouths mawing like the grid of GIFs I made of
my lips repeating, silent again, the words of yet another poem about
gender.</p>

<p>I wanted to treat ‘ladymouth’ like a black box, to shove everything
inside that I didn’t want to know about the horrible things being said
on the internet about women and anyone othered. The black box doesn’t
work this way. The box, in all its complex code, holding all its rage
and color, requires tending.</p>
<p>I had to enter the box and learn its codes, in order to create with
it. In doing so I began to care for it. I even began to care about the
people being cruel to it. [Stay with the trauma.] Ashby says that
another system emerges along with the black box: “the experimenter is
coupling himself to the Box, so that the two together form a system with
feedback” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ashbyIntroductionCybernetics1956">(Ashby 1956)</span>. I am
tethered to all the black boxes making judgments that affect my
dailiness. Thanks a lot, Ashby. Turns out it’s me stuck in the box —
magician’s assistant, thrown voice like Alexa — my head and legs peek
out from its severed halves.</p>

<p>How much loss is normal? How do you recognize loss when it looks
generative? Large models are said to hallucinate when they output
incorrect information that sounds plausible. They recombine data in
strange ways, like misremembering. The term ‘hallucinate’ sounds too
human, implies too much agency[, even though someone who is
hallucinating cannot help it either]. &gt;“Hallucination symptoms may
manifest as deficiencies in various vision-language tasks like judgment
and description, or factual errors in different visual semantics, such
as objects, attributes, and relations.” <span class="citation"

<p>Ashby sounds like an infomercial advertiser (specifically the <a
href="https://youtu.be/0xzN6FM5x_E">guy who slaps duct tape on a boat he
just sawed in half</a>?) when he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“no skill is called for! We are assuming, remember, that nothing is
known about the Box, and when this is so the method of making merely
random variations […] is as defensible as any other method, for no facts
yet exist.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ashbyIntroductionCybernetics1956">(Ashby 1956)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No facts yet exist — that’s easy for him to say, when he’s decided to
assume from the start that nothing is known or can be. This is not fine.
Pipi, can you please smash the window of this hot-boxed black box with a
flower already?</p>
<p>Black boxes don’t just say, “I don’t know,” they say, “I don’t want
to know.” They use ‘unknowability’, which they declared rather than
discovered, as justification not to investigate further. When I shortcut
to the black box, I have the privilege to know something only by its
interface. I choose the parts I want to interact with, the parts that
are of use to me, the knobs I want to turn, the switches I want to flip,
the parameters I want to adjust. I get to choose not to care about the
bits inside. This is an unsustainable choice. It ignores trauma and
creates even more.</p>
<p>Black box theory insists on unknowability as a way to
instrumentalize. But it doesn’t know the point is not to prevent loss.
Even if it were — I cannot prevent loss and neither can you.</p>
<p>Besides, there are far sweeter ways of knowing and unknowing. There
is fizz and curiosity. There is dovetailedness holding us together. All
the rage and color and quilting and texture inside.</p>
<p>Pipi, your show is called, “Big heartedness, be my neighbor.” I like
that you don’t place claims. When you could have asked ‘be mine’, you
ask only to be nearby <span class="citation"
data-cites="PipilottiRistBig">(<span>“Pipilotti Rist: Big Heartedness,
Be My Neighbor”</span> n.d.)</span>.</p>
<p>I can insist on another’s unknowability and stay near [them/it][, not
define it or deny it]. I can let it texture me. I can write other
functions.</p>

<!-- In a wiki, a stub is an article that should exist but does not, a mere suggestion of knowledge that is probably out there but which no one has documented. It is potential energy, an invitation to contribute. A heralding. A summoning. A convocation. A reaching node in the network, a synapse growing. A bid for attention. The opposite of a loss.  -->
<!-- >There are two kinds of touch: skin-on-skin and skin-on-paper. With skin-on-skin touch, your fingertips are closer to your heart. Your senses are better able to register the depth of the other person's emotions. Skin-on-paper touch is the kind that most of us learn to handle by the age of five.

She crowdsourced 109 different affects. I’ve paired each with an emoji and put them into a spreadsheet and I call this sheet a short story/lyric essay. 
I added my own breakups to the list. Hers was the training data. Mine the test data. It is underfitting.  -->
<!-- Pipi, stuck in the TV, screaming silently to get out, I always feel like you are falling, falling, losing, stuck, lost.  -->
<!-- love as undercommon undercurrent aquifer, force of dismantling erosive force, filling in cracks, touching everything like water does, the wake is the follow up wave of a large force pushing through -->
