<p>Critical AI researchers see the urgent need to understand and rethink
how AI systems are defined, developed, regulated, and mitigated.

implementing critical approaches into AI systems more broadly requires

<p>This dissertation argues for craft-based, process-oriented,
community-driven approaches to AI.</p>
<p>A large interdisciplinary community is pushing for understanding,
critiquing, and rethinking how we define, develop, deploy, regulate,
use, and mitigate the effects of machine learning tasks, datasets,
models, algorithms, architectures, and agents, which we collectively and
nebulously understand as ‘AI’ systems. Critical AI includes critical
analysis of the pitfalls of existing methods. In some formulations it
calls for applying alternative indigenous, feminist, queer, crip,
neurodivergent, and intersectional approaches; however, critical AI is
distinguished from applied approaches like ‘AI for Good’ or ‘AI for
Society’, which can lack critical perspectives despite their intended
altruism. Importantly, Critical AI as a set of mixed methods of analysis
and intervention has yet to be adopted into standard machine learning
practices, even as the use and awareness of AI escalates and its
interventions grow more urgent. <!-- problem statement -->
<!-- This dissertation argues for craft-based, process-oriented, community-driven approaches to AI that can help meet this challenge.  --></p>
<p><em>Coding.Care: Guidebooks for Intersectional AI</em> demonstrates
that implementing critical approaches into AI systems more broadly
requires building inviting, inclusive spaces where more people can
engage creatively and critically with each other and with machine
learning techniques as malleable materials. It presents guides for
fostering critical–creative coding communities as radical spaces of
belonging—activated by an ethos and a politics modeled by queer and
trans* communities that embraces radical difference. This creates a
basis for deep interdisciplinary thought, interrogation of formative
principles, and an openness to co-creation and alternative forms
necessary to reimagine AI.</p>
<p>Critical–creative coding is the term I use to describe combining
creative coding (existing artistic approaches to software and their
surrounding communities) with applied critical approaches. Like
‘tactical media’ and ‘critical engineering’, critical–creative coding
creates software and other technological objects in order to investigate
them as objects of study and critique. It also emphasizes the process-,
community-, and material-focused aspects of creative practice by looking
to crafting and the arts. Critical methods activate creative modes and
root them in sociotechnical complexity. Creative methods in turn
activate critical modes and root them in care and connection, taking the
critical out of the abstract and into action. This is not a binary but a
blending that is needed to address AI’s urgent concerns.</p>
<p>The emphasis on craft and creativity is not exclusively aesthetic but
also strategic. Artists, activists, scholars, and technologists can
recast their relationships to emerging technologies by reframing them as
crafts like crochet—deflating AI hype, lowering barriers to learning,
and emphasizing sustainability and process. Thinking craft-as-technology
honors the inherited knowledge of many outsider communities. Thinking
technology-as-craft provides a framework to implement those theories,
ethics, and tactics as intersectional critical AI.</p>
<p><em>Coding.Care</em> collects four publications that enact the
strategies it theorizes. Because different modalities can better address
and unite a wider range of communities, these works make interventions
with different audiences by relying upon different voices, forms,
formats, and media to address different stages of the sociotechnical
pipelines that produce algorithmic systems like generative AI.</p>
<p>“Coding.Care: Field Notes for Making Friends with Code” describes
critical–creative programming approaches founded in the belief that
anyone can contribute to the future of digital systems and that we all
have skills to teach each other. It gives courage to pick up unfamiliar
tools, find resources to kick off a new programming project, pose
questions critically, or solve problems creatively. It asks: How do we
code with more care? How do we encode more care into our lives? How are
these connected? It supports building or joining cooperative,
interdisciplinary communities for co-learning coding. “Coding.Care”
addresses reluctant or would-be programmers (of any age) and and
potential group leaders, with a warm and friendly pocket guide, at the
moment where they might intervene with critical or imaginative software
creation.</p>
<p>“A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets”
offers practical guidance for conscientious dataset stewardship. It
combines critical AI theories and technical data science concepts,
explained in accessible language. It addresses journalists, students,
scholars, activists, artists, and anyone starting to work with existing
machine learning datasets, in the form of an instructional guidebook
that combines approachable techniques with critical thinking questions,
at the point when they are choosing, using, and maintaining datasets as
the foundation for machine learning tasks. It is paired with the
“Inclusive Datasets Research Guide,” an online resource written for USC
Libraries, which addresses a diverse student population who are also
beginning to work with datasets.</p>
<p>Both of these texts apply concepts from the “Intersectional AI
Toolkit,” which argues that anyone should be able to understand what AI
is and help shape what AI ought to be. The Toolkit’s co-authored zines
are accessible guides to both AI and intersectionality. They find common
vocabularies to connect diverse communities around AI’s urgent
questions. Its online resources learn from legacies of queer, feminist,
antiracist, anticolonialist, and antiablest theories, ethics, and
tactics, showing how established but marginalized tactics are necessary
for reimagining more critical and ethical machine learning. The Toolkit
addresses anyone who wants to understand the automated systems that
impact them by using public workshops, zines, and digital resources in
order to describe key concepts and processes of machine learning through
critical lenses.</p>
<p>As interstices among these three texts, a collection of five short
lyric essays imagine dialogues with five 20th century artists, asking
how the artists’ analog material practices might act as pre-responses to
the contemporary digital concerns raised across <em>Coding.Care</em>.
“Codes for (Un)Raveling,” “Codes for (Un)Limiting,”Codes for
(Un)Forming,” “Codes for (Un)Living,” and “Codes for (Un)Knowing”
approach the lived experience of an algorithmic era from oblique angles.
Unlike the other texts, the tone of the “Codes” essays addresses
nonpractitioners on a more affective, aesthetic register, meant for
reflection on the impact of sociotechnical systems as they entangle with
individuals and marginalized groups.</p>
<p>The guides in <em>Coding.Care</em> deal with machine learning
datasets, intersectional AI, coding communities, and embodied
algorithmic art. Together, they want to meet readers where they are—as
non-academics or those bridging into new fields, looking for a common
vocabulary to engage conscientiously with the urgent concerns of AI
systems. Because the project as a whole emphasizes the need for open,
inclusive communities, it enacts its argument through its creation
processes: using open-access, multi-modal, iterative publication rather
than emphasizing a single, authoritative, final product.
<em>Coding.Care</em> offers an expansive invitation to deepen
interdisciplinary conversation, apply intersectional approaches, and
rework AI systems from critical–creative–caring perspectives.</p>
