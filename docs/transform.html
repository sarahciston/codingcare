<h1>What Are Queer Trans*formative Systems?</h1>
<p>What does crafting trans*formative systems look like? How could they
operate? Where does this happen already? I hope we can figure that out
together. The works of <em>Coding.Care</em> are experiments and
instructions for myself/ves, past-present-future, gathering tactics from
many traditions, making connections, collecting strategies, and
wayfinding for the kinds of worlds and systems I want to [be part
of/join/create]. As a phrase, ‘crafting trans*formative systems’ both
proposes and describes a present possibility — an intersectional
[trans*feminist] approach to [reading and relating to] emergent
technological systems. Each part of the phrase says so much more about
the whole. [XXX]</p>
<section id="transformative" class="level2">
<h2>Trans*formative</h2>
<p>Trans*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It
means process-oriented, community-oriented practices. It means making
space for and honoring what we figure out as we go along, [adjusting and
tailoring to the needs and goals of our specific situations as we
operate in community].</p>
<p>‘Transformative’ includes transformative justice, which recognizes
that oppressive systems are at the root of technological harms. It
argues that acknowledging systemic oppression is essential to addressing
those harms and shifting away from carceral logics and toward healing
systems. Transformative justice seeks repair beyond punishment, focusing
not only on remedying wrongs but more broadly on instituting
infrastructures of care <span

class="sidenote">The phrase “infrastructures of care” comes from
Christina Dunbar-Hester’s <em>Hacking Diversity</em>, in which she
refers specifically to the work done in open-source and hacker
communities to create “more inclusive spaces for women, trans, and
gender non-conforming people.” I use the term “infrastructures of care”
in this work to discuss such communities below, but I also use the term
more broadly to refer to mutual aid and other forms of community in
practice.<br />

technology, but of what to build in its place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From the design to the production to the deployment to the outcome,
there is constantly bias built in. It’s not just the biases of the
people themselves; it’s the inherent bias within the system. There’s so
many points of influence that, quite frankly, our fight is not for
cleaning up the data. Our fight is not for an unbiased algorithm,
because we don’t believe that even mathematically, there could be an
unbiased algorithm for policing at all.” […] “The goal is always to be
building power toward abolition of these programs, because you can’t
reform them. There is no such thing as kinder, gentler racism, and these
programs have to be dismantled.” (Hamid Khan interviewed in <span

class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">‘Abolition’ is an approach to social change with the
goal to eliminate the need for prisons and state-based law enforcement.
Activist Ruth Wilson Gilmore says, “Abolition is not absence, it is
presence. What the world will become already exists in fragments and
pieces, experiments and possibilities. So those who feel in their gut
deep anxiety that abolition means knock it all down, scorch the earth

from the present, in all of the ways we can.” <span class="citation"

Like abolition, ‘prefigurative’ just means embodying our values, making
it “a daily endeavor of creating the world we want.” and “our actions

revolution to start another, better world.” <span class="citation"

emotional ones, digital with digestive. Trans*formative processing
refers both to processing units (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs) and also to
processing personal, communal, and generational trauma. It means both

<p>“Revolutionary movements require a teleological pool from which to
draw. The imagination is that teleological pool: it not only creates
liberatory drives; it sustains, justifies and legitimises them. It
undoes entire epistemes and clears a space for us to create something
new. Though this ‘newness’, or the demand for something else, can never
fully be realised in the realm of the discursive, it exists in other
registers: it can be felt, heard, touched, tasted. The structural limits
of this world restrict our ability to articulate all that the
imagination is capable of conceiving. Do not forget this.” <span

<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>Transformers are a current type of machine learning architecture
being employed to create large models like ChatGPT and Stable
Diffusion.<span

</span></span> They are good at digesting large clumps of text, images,
video — all interpreted as numbers — and reconstituting them.
Transformers main parts are called encoders and decoders, and it’s often
said that even their designers don’t know what exactly is going on in
these hidden layers. We can discuss the specifics of that elsewhere (see
Interstitial: Codes for Un/Knowing). I find it more interesting that the
<em>transformers themselves</em> do not know what is going on in these
hidden layers of the own architecture — despite all the
anthropomorphizing of AI systems, with widespread use of terms like
“learning” and “understanding.” While they process and produce meaning
(input and output), transformers are never “aware” of the meaning of the
content they are processing along the way. They are just crunching
numbers.</p>

of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees<span

iteration on their forms, we repeat their hype but lose trace of their
histories in “race science” and colonizing power that captures what it
means to know and be known. <span class="citation"

<p>The paper that launched a thousand transformer models was called
“Attention Is All You Need.” Transformer language models incorporate
text context through a mechanism called “self-attention” that examines a
selection of word-units surrounding each word-unit they interpret. <span
class="citation" data-cites="vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023">(Vaswani et al.
2023)</span> As they proceed, they use this interpretation to predict
the next most likely word to appear in a sentence, based on the words
that have commonly appeared near the last few words before.</p>
<p>But we need more than self-attention. We need self-reflection and
co-regulation. We need systems that, in their very architectures,
celebrate difference - rather than erase it.</p>
<!-- each of these para could be expanded. in critAI-genAI paper? -->
<p>To move from the “transformer” model architecture to trans*formative
systems means to acknowledge the requisite entanglement of community
building and [critical sociotechnical systems]. It means knowing the
material we are transforming — by sharing in, speaking nearby, walking
beside, being constituted and supported by, and supporting in turn.</p>

<p>Trans*-ness can be fluid, in motion, evolving, and emergent. It can
also be euphoric, inclusive, embodied, self-identifying, and outside
binaries. <em>Coding.Care</em> imagines systems that might also have
these qualities, that can trans*cend the logics constructed by
capitalist, militaristic, racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages. It is
inspired by decades of trans*feminist and crip technoscience work, <a
href="#criptechno">discussed more below</a>.</p>
<p>This approach to trans*formative technological practices has no
prerequisites. It does not require glowups or dead names, no traumatic
‘before’ in order to desire or access better ‘afters’. We are already
queer-enough, coder-enough, worthwhile-enough to participate in
continually becoming ourselves. We are <a
href="https://coding.care/codingcare#take-comfort-in-this-programmers-paradox">“always-already
programming”</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="AlwaysalreadyprogrammingMd">(<span>“Always-Already-Programming.md”</span>
n.d.)</span>. By adopting this ‘queer enough’ approach from the LGBTQIA+
community as an ethos for critical–creative coding spaces and for a
context in which to examine sociotechnical systems, I have found that it
is possible to welcome a wider range of voices into conversations about
the high stakes of tech. It creates more comfortable, adaptable
tech-focused communities for LGBTQIA+ members and for everyone else who
joins. Technology spaces have much to learn from queer community
building, just as they do from Black and brown communities, yet I am
also mindful that their community building often comes out of necessity
for protection and safety, that it is always a tension between welcoming
and insulating.</p>

<p>“queerness is itself inherent within [the history of] computational

being.” <span class="citation"

<h4>A note about terminology &amp; Trans* &amp; myself:</h4>
<p>It is essential to note that the concepts of ‘trans*’ and
‘transgender’ have their own varied and contested histories, entangled
with colonial histories, class and racialized contexts, politics and
personal stakes for many. These complexities<span

critical theory. They are dynamic, continually evolving, and I hope to
honor this complexity while acknowledging I cannot address it
comprehensively here. In her discussion of the complexly situated
histories of the term ‘transgender’, professor of history and gender and
sexuality studies Marta V. Vicente translates and summarizes psychology
professor Manuel Roberto Escobar’s ethnography of subjects who use a
wide range of labels and while also thinking of themselves as
’trans*:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The trans* body is the result of a specific and historically based
crossing of ‘regimes of knowledge-power’ (Escobar 2016: 105).<span

sides, socially translated by a diversity of languages. Defining oneself
with words such as <em>marica</em> (fag), <em>puta</em> (whore), and
<em>gai</em> (gay) and still thinking themselves as <em>trans*</em>,
Escobar’s subjects express a definition of the self that tries to
maneuver through these ‘regimes of knowledge-power’ to establish their
own space of resistance.<span class="citation"
data-cites="vicenteTransgenderUsefulCategory2021">(Vicente
2021)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trans* in its many contested forms continually grapples with this
work of trying to establish self(s) in the context of “regimes of
knowledge-power” and to establish cooperative spaces of resistance,
which is more than ever required in this moment of computational and
categorical logics. We can look to long histories of trans* communities
resistance for strategies and tactics. In <em>We Want It All: An
Anthology of Radical Trans Poetics</em>, editors Andrea Abi-Karam and
Kay Gabriel declare, “Against the common-sense intuition that crisis
means we must demand less, we assert with our commrades that everything
has to change for anything to continue.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="abi-karamWeWantIt2020">(Abi-Karam and Gabriel
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>I also use the term ‘queer’ here a lot and I have mixed in a kind of
queer politics under the section ‘Trans*’. I am keenly aware that
everyone has a different take, of course, and I’m wary of wielding such
weighty words unwisely. For me, queer is the term that includes and
elides all the categories of LGBTQIA+, and that’s why I like it. Queer
shows you its politics and shares nothing else. Plus, it’s the only term
I found that came close to “fiting” what I felt about myself when
nothing else felt quite right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For me, ‘queer’ is not a name so much as a protest against
complacency when naming. It records a discomfort with prevailing
languages for embodiment. It is not another identity so much as a steady
refusal of identification—of any settled facts of life that we are
supposed (already) to know. […] No queer names without queer naming,
which cannot fit easily into our usual stories.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="jordanQueerCallingsUntimely2023">(Jordan 2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Up to now I have not used the term ‘trans*’ to self-identify, even if
in some ways it may be correct. By way of talking about the word
‘trans*’ in relationship to trans*formative systems, I will try to tease
out my relationship to the term. I think I’ve been avoiding my own
stakes in ‘trans*’. I was concerned my stakes were false, or would
appear false, but it’s actually that I didn’t have the language for
myself. Because there isn’t language for wanting to be without language,
for not wanting to be seen or described or labeled — to have your
attributes held against you in an alley or an email. Or maybe they they
already found a label for not wanting a label, and that language is just
‘genderqueer’ or ‘agender’ and it still doesn’t sit right. The only
thing I like about this complex ever-turbid gender taxonomy is that it
doesn’t sit still. I hate this business of taxonomies anyway and its
categorizing logic is how we got to machine learning and many worse
things in the first place. This could be the core of the question, if I
weren’t still feeling for the question.</p>
<p>I wasn’t using ‘trans*’ for myself (though now I’ve gone and claimed
it for my book, wtf) because it didn’t sit right either when I worried
other people need it more, needed the term to survive, and I had been
surviving without it — as if language is a finite natural resource, like
rare earth minerals we’re extracting to make models of language. I used
to worry the same thing about the word ‘queer’ before I practiced
letting myself try it on, just a little (as a treat). That discomfort
grew, then eventually transformed into some kind of resilience akin to
pride. Still, I feel I am an ungrateful thing, whenever I reject the
privileges I have when I go passing as a straight cis woman who is none
of those things, those privileges tangled up with the erasures it
brings, the over and over of nixing a self. It feels worse to correct
someone because I don’t have a true label to give. Queer and
trans*formative are the only words that feel good enough.</p>
<p>I wasn’t using trans* for myself, or nonbinary or agender or
genderqueer, and I wasn’t using gay or lesbian or bi or pan or any other
term for myself, because I worried these were all labels for people who
knew who they were and had always known, who stood so far outside the
identity they were called that they required this word as a reckoning.
For so long I have been completely out of contact with my body and its
shapes and desires. The middle space with no reckonings was safe. I had
been just reading the room for cues to how I was supposed to feel, and
that small rural version of me was the only reality there was. But I am
writing for all the people who haven’t known who they are, who haven’t
learned the tools the easy way, wjp haven’t fit into the terms or the
counterterms, who need permission to play in the spaces between like I
have needed — whether they play with gender or with code or both.</p>
<p>To identify with new terms (or new tools) is to make bold claims. My
life would need to change for claims like these. I’d need to put my skin
in the game, to admit my skin is already in the game, to admit I have
skin. I’ve spent so long disavowing the body below my neck as it aches
for me to acknowledge it. The body below my neck is the whole world
around it, an “I” of diffuse particulates, not even atoms swirling,
because the atomic model of the universe is a fiction divised by
object-oriented bros who still think they can be islands. I spent so
long as a decapitated head — <br> a magician’s assistant trying to <br>
keep the show going trying <br> to please, trying to keep <br> the body
I couldn’t feel <br> safe.</p>
<p>Resetting is a recursive process. It is not just a trick of pulling
out the tablecloth from beneath the finely laid placesettings and the
severed head.</p>
<p>Trans* is not transition, not as simple as movement from one thing to
another. Trans* is not transformation; trans* breaks open transformation
with its asterisk and its radical understandings of form/ative (both
discussed further below). Trans* is much more expansive. It is
unrestrictedly being who you have always been, as fully as you are, more
than anyone has previously recognized, and experiencing that recognition
as fully as possible.</p>
<p>This ongoing process can be aided by finding the language (or losing
the language), or finding the tools (or breaking the tools), or finding
the commrades (or making the spaces where they might find you). This
text is inclusive of many understandings of trans*-ness and
transformation, combining them in order to suggest the kind of
trans*formative practices of being and/or making that are prefigurative
— bringing a world into being as it always could have been and should
be, might yet be still, alighting the revolutionary force of latent
potentials that already are. <!-- abolition --></p>
<p>It’s a subtle, vulnerable, powerful thing, just to recognize oneself
more fully — especially if it makes space for others to do the same. I
find that coding communities which are founded based on practices of
queerness and transness (its ethics, tactics, ways of being) can open
those communities as more radical spaces of belonging.</p>

<p id="transduce">
Trans* is endlessly supple and takes on many suffixes. It finds queer
reverberations in the trans*ducers all around us that constitute and
reinforce computational systems. A transducer (from Latin for ‘lead
across’) converts physical signals into electrical signals, or vice
versa. Transducers are intermediaries that allow the trans*fer between
analogue to digital. Every time information gets trans*mitted from an
environmental sensor to a digital device — sound waves into audio files,
optical variation into heart rate — trans*duction has occurred, and thus
some kind of transformation. Transduction shifts information’s register
or level, reimagining its forms. Transduction is always intervention,
informed by the device designers’ decisions as well as both contemporary
and historical approaches to computational knowing. Note how many times
the language of trans*-ness appears in sites of technological knowing.
The material conversions required to power the logics of computation
(such as converting qualities into voltages into quantities) all pass
through gates of trans* thinking.

<h3>* (asterisk)</h3>
<p>The <code>*</code> after <code>trans</code> longs for anything that
follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming, and
as such can include anyone who wonders if they belong, who wonders what
they contribute, who wonders what “this whole thing” is about (be it
gender, sexuality, technology, whatever).</p>
<p>Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial.
It is a footnote that defines our terms, and also it is the invitation
to extend beyond any definition given.</p>
<p>The asterisk is a perturbation, a pebble in the shoe. In the German
language, the gendering of nouns and verbs is haphazardly addressed by
an asterisk that breaks the word, introduces a glottal stop between its
‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ formations. <code>Student</code> or
<code>Studentin</code> becomes <code>Student*in</code>;
<code>Bäcker</code> or <code>Bäckerin</code> becomes
<code>Bäcker*in</code>. This brief interruption can be read as a faulty
solution that maintains gender-as-binary, it’s true. And also, this
hesitation adds a frequent awkwardness that highlights how often
conversation is about gender unnecessarily. It physically opens up a
space (in the mouth) where gender is unknown/unstable/all.</p>
<p>A French or English apostrophe may mark an omission of letters, but
this elision also joins together, suturing up the distance it creates.
The asterisk shares this tension here, as a clot that heals, an
unspeakable but audible gasp.</p>
<p>Like the apostrophe at the start of <code>'pataphysics</code>, which
gestures to the absurdity from which it springs, the asterisk is the
instigator and the multiplier, the pivot and the punctum and the
portal.</p>
<p>It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It
is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations,
abstracted away. It’s not a redaction which the asterisk marks, but the
possibilities of unknown language underneath. It’s the tension of
knowing and not saying, as in the marking of <code>sw*@r</code> words.

<h3>Formative</h3>
<p>What is formative shapes us. Our early experiences make us who we
are. These are the foundations we can’t see, the scaffolding of our
thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the
formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops
of human networks, codified language, and rare earth. How we become. How
we become with and through sociotechnical systems.</p>
<p>Each of the works collected here asks: What are the fundamental
assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a dataset, a
machine learning system, or programmers themselves?
<code>What are the formative assumptions underlying any technology or way of being?</code>
These works tease out the metaphors we have relied on so long we can no
longer see them; they ask what other metaphors might make space for new
forms or reforms.</p>
<p>Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can
fill it. I work in code and in art because I believe: If I know how to
make forms, or even platforms, not only the content to plug into
existing forms, I am more free to work both form and content in
iterative, ongoing relationships. This is how I knead the dough — form
and content and form and content and form. They are inseparable.</p>
<p>In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make,
through its insistence, resistence, grain, thread tension. It in-forms
itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. It also
re-forms me through this mutual process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In both carpentry and textiles, the form of a thing does not stand
over it or lie behind it but emerges from this mutual shaping, within a
gathering of forces, both tensile and frictional, established through
the engagement of the practitioner with materials that have their own
inclinations and vitality.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold 2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Form activates. No form is neutral, although if we use it long enough
we begin to look through it, like the blank page, or the MS Word ‘blank
page’. Each interface or material enables or encourages particular
experiences and outcomes, and denies or deflects others — whether
through predictive text in search, syntax highlighting in code, or the
constraint of an eight-page paper zine. Some forms invite us to
collaborate in imagining the usefulness of their limits and the
boundlessness in their constraints. Through time spent in process,
working with and against form, our focus can shift from producing
outputs that meet the brief of the form, to working with the form to
reshape both the form and ourselves in new understandings and new
orientations.</p>
<p>Yet current modes of computational logic are not mutually
constitutive in trans*formative ways. Instead, they impose form on us as
data subjects and subjectees. Computation requires information to take
any output formations. Its orderly logic is a shape imposed by and
reflecting the world. It requires contortion to represent us. As media
theorist Sarah Sharma reminds us, for the ‘Broken Machines’ who do not
quite fit these regimes, “to represent is also to be filed away” <span
class="citation" data-cites="sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020">(Sharma
2020)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In order to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your
solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make
comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce. […] perhaps we
need to bring an end to the very notion of a scale. Displace all
reduction. Agree not merely to the right to difference but, carrying
this further, agree also to the right to opacity that is [not enclosure
within an impenetrable autarchy but] subsistence within an irreducible
singularity. Opacities can coexist and converge, weaving fabrics. To
understand these truly one must focus on the texture of the weave and
not on the nature of its components. For the time being, perhaps, give
up this oid obsession with discovering what lies at the bottom of
natures. There would be something great and noble about initiating such
a movement, referring not to Humanity but ta the exultant divergence of
humanities. Thought of self and thought of other here become obsolete in
their duality. Every Other is a citizen and no longer a barbarian. What
is here is open, as much as this there. 1 would be incapable of
projecting from one to the other. This-here is the weave, and it weaves
no boundaries. The right to opacity would not establish autism; it would
be the real foundation of Relation, in freedoms.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="glissantPoeticsRelation2009a">(Glissant 2009)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To understand through computation is to reduce to categorization’s
logics <span class="citation"
data-cites="crawfordAtlasAIPower2021 amaroBlackTechnicalObject2022">(Crawford
2021; Amaro 2022)</span>. The formative structures we create
(taxonomies, schemas, ways of knowing) support restrictive unknowing.
They ease and smooth passage through our days and our systems, saying
don’t look, you already understand. This is why we must imagine new
forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new forms.</p>
<p>Code forms, then calcifies. Pattern turns to template. In the
procedures of object-oriented programming languages, the template runs:
<code>init --&gt; name --&gt; get --&gt; set</code><span
class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle"/><span
class="sidenote">Creating classes in object-oriented programming lets
the programmer instantiate each instance of an object with a
pre-determined form, adjustable only within those limits. These
processes indicate what prior schemas you’ll pull from, what parts
you’ll write over, what qualities you’ll predetermine. They indicate
what aspects will be qualities of the entire class, and what qualities
will be specific to each object. They determine what actions each
‘object’ will ‘know’ how to do, and how the programmer or user will
establish and retreive information. There’s a language for all this in
“object-oriented” programming, which requires a different sense of
relationality than “functional” programming.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>“The more a path is used the more a path is used. […] When an effort
becomes normal, a form is acquired.” <span class="citation"

</blockquote>
<p>If forms shape content, and vice versa, of course tools also shape
forms. Equipping ourselves with the knowledge, resources, and agency to
make the tools (to make the platforms to make the forms to make the
content) is necessary for a more holistic approach to researching
formative tech and creating trans*formative tech. Toolmaking includes
collecting sets of tools, documenting and creating guides to existing
tools as well. It also includes the infrastructures and support systems
necessary to make any of these practices possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“tools and infrastructure are not only the preconditions for the
work; at their best, they are also part and parcel of the work, deeply
integrated into its methods and outcomes. Our tools and infrastructures
are rich objects to think with.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018">(McPherson
2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“instruments develop through engaged and contingent practices.
Instrumentalism involves setting in motion, operationalizing, and
potentially transforming. Instruments—whether in the form of concepts or
sensors—are instrumental to the unfolding, the doing, and the
transforming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="gabrysHowThingsSensors2019">(Gabrys 2019)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We think with our tools, instruments, sensors and the surrounding
systems that enable them and maintain them. All of these layers are
entangled. Susan Leigh Star calls infrastructure a “fundamentally
relational concept,” but one that despite its embeddedness operates
invisibly unless broken. She also argues that infrastructure marks
membership in relational groups, as we “acquire a naturalized
familiarity with its objects,” practices, and standards <span
class="citation"
data-cites="starEthnographyInfrastructure1999">(1999)</span>. Thus
infrastructure — and the tools, platforms, forms, and content that it
consists of — also marks us as belonging, knowing, capable, welcome, or
not.</p>
<p>How do we think critically through re/making infrastructures, when
they exist beyond any one of us, always relational and often invisible?
By returning to, and reattuning to, the solidarities we find within and
across communities, and the frictions we find within and across
materials.</p>
<p id="criptechno">
Those who are left unsupported by infrastructures, those who are left
out of representations or who are targeted disproportionately by digital
systems, already know in deeply embodied ways about the friction they
feel as they move through systems that do not easily contain their
forms. Scholars Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsche, authors of the “Crip
Technoscience Manifesto” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span>, call
these infrastructures “frictioned technologies” and emphasize:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the skills, wisdom, resources, and hacks disabled people utilize for
navigating and altering inaccessible worlds. In pushing crip
technoscience as a field of research and a practice of critical
‘knowing-making’, we conjure frictional practices of access production,
acknowledging that science and technology can be used to both produce
and dismantle injustice.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their manifesto reminds us that disabled people are not minoritized
users of technologies created by experts but instead are experts
themselves at actively adapting technologies to their needs. By
centering their community as knowledge holders and creators, and by
seeing “interdependence as a political technology,” they shift the
design goals for technology. Rather than outsiders providing services to
achieve normalized individual independence, they reorient toward kinship
building <span class="citation"
data-cites="hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a">(2019)</span>.</p>
<p>Louise Hickman’s ethnographic work on the ethics of access
foregrounds access workers’ key role in the production of crip
technoscientific knowledge. She examines the highly customized
dictionaries developed by her own Communication Access Real-Time
Translation operator working in academic spaces, in order to show how
their captioning work for the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community is
“both the practice of crip technoscience as well as its product.”
Hickman highlights the collaborative, embedded nature of the work and
the crip technoscience emphasis on “knowledge-from-below.” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="hickmanTranscriptionWorkPractices2019a">(Hickman

<p>Thus, form is always forming from within complex systems of
interrelation. Formative and transformative technologies are more (and
less) than their forms. They must emerge on our own terms — from the
formats and methods of the communities they serve, with our values,
goals, and approaches leading the way.</p>
<p>Interdependence has been my intuitive compass, my frustration and
fascination, for as long as I remember. I have searched for the means to
describe this feeling, through art, literature, touch, and other means.
Slowly and repeatedly, I keep finding that the best resources for
describing this sense of interdependence come from Indigenous sources. I
keep returning to this realization:</p>
<p><code>Interdependence is indigenous knowledge.</code></p>

<p>“an object or thing is not as important as one’s relationship to it.
[…] reality <em>is</em> relationships or sets of relationships.” <span

</blockquote>
<p>Fundamentally reorienting our understanding of objects and knowledge
and ourselves as consituted by our relationships necessarily also
reorients our work and the forms it takes, in deeply formative ways.
Re-prioritizing relationships fundamentally reshapes the forms and
functions of research, artmaking, valuemaking, worldmaking. To see form
(shape, object) as relation (connection) is to position it in time and
place. It is also to take “form” from its noun form (shape, object) into
its verb form (mold, press, begin to exist). As Erin Manning says of the
spiral, it is “more duration than form” <span class="citation"
data-cites="manningAlwaysMoreOne2013">(Manning 2013)</span>. Like all
verbs, then, the verb form implies subjects — the entities enacting and
impressing a form into being, responsible for it, caring for it.
Relationships. This negates object-oriented ontologies and
object-oriented software programs that want to encapsulate and abstract
away objects’ entanglements with the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There can, of course, be no knots without the performance of
knotting: we should therefore commence with the verb ‘to knot’ and view
knotting as an activity of which ‘knots’ are the emergent outcomes. Thus
conceived, knotting is about how contrary forces of tension and
friction, as in pulling tight, are generative of new forms. And it is
about how forms are held in place within such a force-field or, in
short, about ‘making things stick’. Accordingly, our focus should be on
forces and materials rather than form and content.” <span
class="citation" data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">(Ingold
2015)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To frame research through relationships is also to foreground
accountability by asking, as Shawn Wilson offers in <em>Research Is
Ceremony</em>, “What am I contributing or giving back to the
relationship? Is the sharing, growth and learning that is taking place
reciprocal?” Wilson says that in an Indigenous Research Paradigm, “What
is more important and meaningful is fulfilling a role and obligations in
the research relationship—that is, being accountable to your relations”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008">(2008)</span>.</p>
<p>In this sense of reciprocity, the question of form takes shape as an
offering. What does our creative work offer back, and in what form will
that offering be most legible and accessible? Some forms I have tried:
manifesto, toolkit, zine, prototype, platform, black box, machine,
labyrinth, server, service, sentence, story, interface, guide, document,
cauldron, process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Form is simply <em>how</em> a thing exisits (or what it exists as).
[…] Content is <em>why</em> a thing exists. […] but they are not
separable in any object.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="barakaHomeSocialEssays1966">(Baraka 1966)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As form moves into its verb shapes, identity too moves into practice.
Johanna Hedva marks this as a pivot from identity politics to practices
and methods, inextricably coupled as theory-practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Disability, queerness, open source — not as identities, or groups I
belong to, but as modes of doing, of how I practice myself. Being an
outsider means that the question of theory and practice — how practice
is affected by theory, how theory is constructed by practice — becomes
the most important one. Membership to particular groups and experiences
is often predicated on the visual — whether someone ‘looks like’ they
belong or not — which means that my membership to most groups must rely
on something else. My belonging has more to do with how I enact that
group’s politic” <span class="citation"
data-cites="hedvaBelongingMess2018">(Hedva 2018)</span></p>

<p>Our being-in-process is both the means to “be” (prefiguratively) and
also the means of being-in-relation, -in-politic, -in-identity,
in-between. <!-- abolition --></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I dream of a form that can hold everything. A form that can reveal
how each part is connected. No parts, no compartments. Just connections.
Network graphs don’t do it for me. Anna Munster suggests that the form
of networks numbs us to their relationality. Because every network looks
like every other, in trying to understand a system by depicting it as a
network, we lose sense of what’s within. Munster suggests focusing less
on <code>forms</code> and more on <code>forces</code>: “the closures and
openings of relations to one another. It is at this level of
imperceptible flux — of things unforming and reforming relationally —
that we discover the real experience of networks” <span class="citation"
data-cites="munsterAesthesiaNetworksConjunctive2013">(Munster

<p>Here, I apply craft lenses to tech concerns both as a critique and
also as a return. Craft is a material expression of the theories,
ethics, and tactics of intersectionality and sustainability, grounded in
tangible practices which grow out of community. Re-binding craft to
technology evokes slow, circular, cooperative, inclusive, caring
practices that can transform materials and practitioners alike.</p>
<p>Here, working with emergent technologies as craft practices can bring
them off their awe-inducing pedestal and put them back into our hands —
recalling the human agency, access, and scale which emerging
technologies [always-already] require. Reframing tech as craft moves the
focus of technologies like programming and machine learning back onto
their practitioners and their material relationships. Physicist and
activist Ursula M. Franklin compares “holistic technologies” like
artisan crafts which center on the practitioner, to “prescriptive
technologes,” which are focused on production, scale, effectiveness and
management. She says that under the effects of prescriptive
technologies, “we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more
conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is
only one way of doing ‘it.’” Meanwhile holistic technologies require
muscle memory and instinct; they allow the practitioner to “draw on
their own experience, each time applying it to a unique situation” <span
class="citation" data-cites="franklinRealWorldTechnology2004">(Franklin
2004)</span>. Pairing ‘tech’ with ‘craft’ returns focus to the
human-scale aspects of the technological imaginary, from the labor
required to produce and maintain technological objects, to the impacts
and harms it produces as part of human-driven sociotechnical systems, to
the knowledge adapted (and co-opted) from unacknowledged domains and
communities of practice.</p>
<p>Craft remembers that technology are procedures and protocols, as well
as tools and materials. Franklin frames technology as a practice: It is
the way things are done, not only the tools with which they are done — a
system that includes “far more than its individual material components.
Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words,
equations, and, most of all, a mindset.” This shows technology’s deep
link with culture <span class="citation"
data-cites="franklinRealWorldTechnology2004">(Franklin 2004)</span>.
While the English language separates object from practice from person,
in German, <code>die Technik</code> means both ‘the technology’ (object)
and also ‘the technique’, ‘the method’, or ‘the procedure’. In Spanish,
<code>la técnica</code> means all of these, as well as the ‘the
engineer’ or ‘the repairwoman’.</p>
<p>Craft remembers technology is made through practices, by people and
for people, meant to care for people, and we can learn from people in
its making and implementation. Holding these
[components/correspondences] in relation lets us examine and address the
issues of technologies more comprehensively and holistically:</p>

merely in the machines, that we must locate our current predicament. And
it is in these that we shall ﬁnd surprising connections that locate
differently.” <span class="citation"

</blockquote>
<p>Craft remembers how to operate by slow consideration in and for
community, in contrast to ego-driven technocratic prostheletizing that
believes technology can fix technology by moving faster and breaking
more.</p>
<p>‘Tech’ and ‘craft’ are not contradictory, after all. They can be
analog or hybrid, systems-oriented, process-oriented, human- and
more-than-human. Craft and technology are two complementary approaches,
two aspects of the same effort that build on one another.</p>

<p>Many have paired code with craft, or talked about the similarities of
knitting or weaving with programming. Yes, let’s celebrates these
similarities and wants to decontextualize the linear histories of
computer programming, but also let’s push this argument further. It
argues that not only should we bring craft’s materials into coding
spaces, but also we should bring craft’s ethos and ethics into coding
spaces as well. It’s not enough to weave electronics into our fiber arts
as a way to build technical literacy; we need to weave intersectional
methods and mindsets into technical arts. Craft carries many of these
methods and mindsets in its material culture. This section will discuss
a few of these aspects.</p>
<p>Focusing on craft means noticing the material, handworked, skilled,
tinkered, iterative, process-oriented, embodied (intersectional)
practices of knowledge and production that technologies emerge from. It
means noticing how such practices can intervene in existing technologies
and reshape emerging ones. It acknowledges human choices; built skills,
tacit knowledge, and material needs; networks and communities of
practice.</p>
<section id="first-a-note-on-what-craft-is-not" class="level4">
<h4>(First, a note on what craft is not)</h4>
<p>While this text aruges for craft as a materialization of
intersectional theories, ethics, and tactics, which can help apply them
to emerging technologies — craft is not the only way to do
intersectional practice, and not all craft is intersectional
practice.</p>
<p>Craft includes many forms, from fiber arts to woodworking to
programming to writing — but craft here refers to practice, process,
making, and learning, rather than mastery over a skill in order to gain
status or maintain status quo. In contrast to process-oriented crafting,
performance artist and poet Fargo Nissim Tbakhi says that literary craft
“is a counterrevolutionary machine.” High-art notions of craft use
“aesthetics” to refine work toward the polite and proper, in order to
rob them of political power. Tbakhi explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Craft which is taught in Western institutions, taken up and
reproduced by Western publishers, literary institutions, and awards
bodies, is a set of regulatory ideas which curtail forms of speech that
might enact real danger to the constellation of economic and social
values which are, as I write this, facilitating genocide in Palestine
and elsewhere across the globe. […] Craft is the process by which our
own real liberatory tools are dulled, confiscated, and replaced. We
believe our words sharper than they turn out to be. […] what Craft does
to our writing: pressures and pressures until what matters, what we need
to say, gets pushed to the margins or disappeared entirely.” <span
class="citation" data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine
2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tbakhi speaks of craft that responds to (and enacts) institutional
measuring, monitoring, regard, and power. This is the craft of euphemism
and nihilism. Such craft is the milquetoast technical fix to machine
learning’s ‘fairness’ problems that replaces offending text like ‘dyke’,
because it cannot tell the difference between a slur and a community. It
replaces offending text with boilerplate diversity speak that comes out
both toothless and simultaneously ‘too woke’. It replaces offending text
but offers nothing intsead, and the chasm that remains is all some of us
get to know of ourselves from generative AI systems. I agree with Tbakhi
about this kind of craft, when he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Craft is what keeps us polite while the boot is on our neck or on
somebody else’s. And we cannot afford that, not now and not going
forward.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine 2023)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But craft need not stay polite or straighten its rough edges.
“Anticolonial writers in the U.S. and across the globe have long modeled
alternative crafts which reject these priorities, and continue to do so
in this present moment. Yet Craft still haunts our writing” <span
class="citation" data-cites="magazineNotesCraftWriting2023">(Magazine
2023)</span> Despite this haunting, other engagements with craft — craft
as community, craft as lineage, craft as experimentation, craft as
resistance — can also help us to reject the institutional and
infrastructural claims to our voices.</p>
<p>Reclaiming craft does not mean [becoming/focusing] so small that we
cannot be effective nor so precious [about aesthetics] that we lose the
cause. It does not mean a return to luddite nostalgia: Everything was
<em>not</em> simpler in the past, except for the few people who held
more power over others (same as now). Reclaiming craft from its
feminized, domesticized, racialized pejoratives and applying craft as a
lens for technology practices means embracing its scrappy imperfections
and [revolutionary] potentials.</p>
</section>
<section id="scale" class="level4">
<h4>Scale</h4>
<p>Craft scales much differently than a machine learning system, and
these frictions can be used for aesthetic investigation and activist
resistence. Detailed hand labor is a critical tactic available to tackle
the seemingly insurmountable scale of the increasingly giant datasets,
obscured models, and complex infrastructures. For example, Everest
Pipkin viewed every single video in a large dataset over the course of
months and turned this labor into a series of artistic investigations
<span class="citation"
data-cites="pipkinLaceworkWatchingEntire2020">(Pipkin 2020)</span>. At
the Knowing Machines research project (I discuss my work with them more
in the “Formative” section), interdisciplinary researchers from
journalists to programmers to lawyers work together to create tools to
explore changes in foundational image datasets like ImageNet <span
class="citation" data-cites="crawfordWaysSeeDataset">(Crawford et al.,
n.d.)</span>. These practices apply human-scale attention to
machine-scale systems in order to reveal their obscured innerworkings.
Just because a system is larger than life does not make it impossible to
apply human techniques to investigate it. While the gargantuan
computational scale makes it more tedious, this human-scale labor is
still an incredibly important response for understanding and confronting
algorithmic harms.</p>
<p>For Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, texture is a way of talking about the
space between dimensions or scales, or the transition between them. I
have found her metaphoric comparison useful and have extended it to
machine learning: * From point to line to cube to cube in space-time to
multidimensional universes of vibrating strings. * From ball to string
to loop to fabric to garment. * From scalar to vector to matrix to
tensors in many dimensions.</p>
<p>Sedgwick describes the many directions of touch and contact across a
surface and between dimensions, warp and weft of all kinds. She builds
on this a theory of relationality, which understands the reciprocity of
contact, the reciprocity of creating and being, and the fractal nature
of scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the sense of touch makes nonsense out of any dualistic understanding
of agency and passivity; to touch is always already to reach out, to
fondle, to heft, to tap or enfold, and always also to understand other
people or natural forces as having effectually done so before oneself,
if only in the making of the textured object.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="sedgwickWeatherProust2012">(Sedgwick 2012)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Sedgwick connects the experience of making craftwork with
experiencing the made craft, with touching and being touched by, and
with multidimensional sense and scale. I also see this as a way of
understanding machine learning modeling through new, non-hierarchical
metaphors. What is the scale and dimensionality of machine learning?
Does it “dramatize its dimensional betweenness,” as Sedgwick describes
the way a folded dyed fabric or a paper snowflake, once unfolded,
retains the memory of past shapes? <span class="citation"
data-cites="sedgwickWeatherProust2012">(Sedgwick 2012)</span>. Or Ingold
similarly describes the way once knotted ropes retain their bends: “But
the knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget” [<span
class="citation" data-cites="ingoldLifeLines2015">Ingold
(2015)</span>][, and Laura Marks says “electrons remember” <span
class="citation" data-cites="marksTouchSensuousTheory2002">(Marks
2002)</span>]? These material memories, as marks of their current and
past states simultaneously, could be tangible metaphors for
understanding machine learning, or even quantum computing (folding was a
fascination of quantum physicist David Bohm). They show that, when
working with any material, the material works back.</p>
<p>Thinking through technology with craft lenses opens more points of
reference for addressing complexity and complex systems that prexist the
emergent techonlogies we are encountering now. It reminds us that we can
slip between scales to find apt materials and metaphors for grappling
with the complexity of systems more approachably and sustainably.
Movements across scales, and finding the spaces between and resistances
to scale, are also useful explorations. What gets lost in the increase,
and what is gained (to whose benefit) as we move either direction?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“human care can’t scale up. Care happens in small-scale moments of
human interaction; scale is achieved by tireless and impersonal
machinery” <span class="citation"

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“As hand knitting inclined to the margins as a [large-scale] viable
manufacturing process, it was its long history of connecting people with
their environment that came to the fore—from material source to the
makers’ largely unwritten generational knowledge of patterns and
techniques—in clearly locating the craft of knitting against distinct
communities and indigenous practices.” <span class="citation"

<h4>Sustain(ability)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“The mere act of owning real tools and having the power to use them
is a radical and rare idea that can help change the world around us.”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="schwarzAnarchistToolChest2010">(Schwarz 2010)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft suggests more time spent with one’s objects and materials —
allowing for repair, error, and air. For woodworker Christopher Schwarz,
it means simple tools known well, a small collection of tools in a
toolbox that can be carried with you anywhere in order to complete your
work, providing freedom and autonomy <span class="citation"
data-cites="schwarzAnarchistToolChest2010">(Schwarz 2010)</span>. It
accumulates through simple gestures repeated until they become habit
(muscle memory, durational practices, implicit knowledge), repeated
until they become complex patterns (quilts, quines rice kolams),
repeated until they make space for other things to happen in their
presence (sewing circles, hacker spaces, political action). Imagine a
simple machine learning tool as easy to pick up as a garden trowel.
Would this be an all-purpose ‘multi-tool’ like today’s resource-hungry
giant language models? No. But its users would have freedom to imagine
their own goals and outcomes from a broad range of possibilities they
design themselves. Imagine if machine learning systems were built from
these operating principles instead of requiring such massive financial
resources, natural resource, and human resources to operate that only a
few huge conglomerates can particpate in their creation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the pre-Industrial craftsman didn’t seem to have secret tricks as
much as he had lots of opportunities to practice and become swift.”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="schwarzAnarchistToolChest2010">(Schwarz 2010)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Builder Alexander Langland returns to the older definition of
‘craeft’ as a lifesustaining skill built over generations. He sees
craftwork as holistic interrelation rather than individual objects or
skills. He says, “Crafts have always been determined by the immediate
environment, and indexed to the resources of the natural world.” Imagine
if we saw technology’s global supply chains as the integrated lifecycle
of care that Langland describes, which starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“tended landscape &gt; sustainable production of raw materials &gt;
intelligently processed &gt; beautifully made &gt; fit for purpose &gt;
fondly used &gt; ingeniously reused &gt; considerately discarded &gt;
given back to the earth” <span class="citation"

<blockquote>
<p>“Casualized labor begets commodity toolsets, frictionless and
uncritical engagement with content, and shallow practices of use.”

</section>
<section id="infrastructures-of-care" class="level4">
<h4>Infrastructures of care</h4>
<p>Approaching technology through the lens of craft slows it down and
asks it to sustain. It also [organizes people, labor, and relations]
differently. Anthropolgist Gabriella (Biella) Coleman aligns hacking
with crafting, focusing on the “intellectual guile” required for both
and the guild-like communities that form. “[A]ll hackers fit the bill as
quintessential ‘craftspeople,’ […] Even if craftspeople tend to work in
solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on
shared rules of engagement and standards for quality” <span
class="citation" data-cites="colemanHackers2016">(Coleman Tue,
06/07/2016 - 12:00)</span>. Consider the transfeminist server, which
approaches its technology as a crafted, social, interrelational
object:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“rosa [travelling server] is not only constituted in hardware or
sotware, but also the multitude of relations that are created around the
making, maintaining and passing on of this infrastructure: the processes
that are performed, the affective charge of their actioning, the
community around them.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="variaTraversalNetworkFeminist">(<strong>variaTraversalNetworkFeminist?</strong>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feminist servers run slowly. Sustaining them takes “years of intense
collective learning,” replete with uncomfortable tensions and messy
differences. These very ambivalances, argues Ines Kleesattle, are
crucial for Feminist Server Art, because they demonstrate the relational
labor going unseen in other approaches to technology. “All kinds of
infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor”
(Kleesattel in <span class="citation"
data-cites="sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021">(Sollfrank, Stalder, and
Niederberger 2021)</span>). When giant data centers run in a far-flung
artic landscapes, and large language models siphon water and energy and
human effort for their training, these “cloud” technologies are not
ephemeral or immaterial – and feminist projects move slowly to enact the
material, relational stakes in all digital interactions, to show how
they might be organized with more awareness and care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“How can the labour behind hosting be made inclusive, convivial,
shared, visible not only in moments when things go wrong? In what ways
does the language embedded in server administration influence the
practices and interactions around it? How can servers be pedagogical
spaces for experimentation for those with different knowledges?” [varia
email list 28.11.2023]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft requires taking care and caretaking, as does technology.
Transfeminist infrastructure work shows how the logics and ethics of
craft – especially its domestic and feminized aspects – emerge out of
intersectional feminist approaches and apply to technological questions.
To consider technology as entangled with its affective and labor
relations, as feminist infrastructures do, resituates tech back into a
variety of communities of practice and reframes its relationship to
caretaking. Although many have looked to technological solutions like
bots to address issues of labor and caretaking, more often technology
itself requires caretakers and creates more care labor. To respond to
this, feminist infrastructures show how care is generated through human
networks and how care might also be generated in, rather than depleted
by, digital ones. They place technology within a circuit of human
relations rather than as a replacement for it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care,
but also to generate care. [… G]enerating care means counting in
participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to
succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation
indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of
understanding.” <span class="citation"

<p>Along with the traveling Raspberry Pi server “rosa” that acted as
their working hub, the Traversal Network project culminated in a print
and digital publication that reflected on the different groups’ shared
and diverse approaches. By choosing “low-effort publishing tools” like
<a href="https://etherdump.vvvvvvaria.org/">varia etherdump</a>, by
providing strategic services like analog infrastructure for mutual aid,
as well as digital infrastructure like hosting archives and zombie sites
of ongoing work, feminist servers like <a
href="https://anarchaserver.org/">Anarchaserver</a> create and codify
solidarity networks using multiple mediums and tactics. These are forms
of “feminist convergence” that embody their values through their choice
of methods and material offerings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For us feminist infrastructure enables the systematization, the
maintenance and the circulation of good ideas, practice and care. For
us, solidarity networks are an example of feminist infrastructure. And
we think it represents one of our earliest feminist technologies,
perhaps the oldest and the most widespread.” <span class="citation"

<p>For infrastructures of care, communities themselves are the essential
networks; the servers, databases, workshops, services, both digital and
analog are all tools toward building and means of expressing those
community networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The internet can bring us very close, yes, but it is even better to
meet <em>cuerpa</em>-to-<em>cuerpa</em>. The presence of the others
gives us the feeling of ecstacy, makes us float. Meeting gives us power
and energy, facilitates processes, and intensifies networks of trust and
cooperation. Sometimes we converge in our disputed territories, the
street the networks, and the servers, and other times in places where we
can create spaces of security, confidence, and relaxation.” <span

<p>A variety of forms and modalities allows for more kinds of access.
Craft, and other means of creating forms, helps imagine what access is
possible and who might be missing out. For example, zine-making and zine
distribution networks precede digital networks, provide models for
digital practices while subsisting alongside them. This publishing craft
is a counterinfrastructure used to build counterpublics and underground
communities, to create counterarchives or living texts <span
class="citation"
data-cites="ademaLivingBooks2021">(<strong>ademaLivingBooks2021?</strong>)</span>,
and to clarify information to new audiences. Feminist media historian
Cait McKinney’s research into underground lesbian networks, both analog
and digital, shows that “lesbian-feminist information infrastructures
are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration
and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020">(McKinney
2020)</span>. Marginalized, precarious conditions of queer communities
has called for interventions by alternative means. Graphic designer Paul
Soulellis, who maintains the Queer Archive Work project, suggests that
zines are archives of crisis: “evidence of queer life persists in the
urgent artifacts that emerge in crisis — artifacts that arise
expediently as part of efforts to advocate for slowness, care,
mutuality, queer joy, pleasure, refusal, and community” <span
class="citation" data-cites="soulellisBadArchives2023">(Soulellis
2023)</span>. The precarity of these communities requires more care and
more flexible materials, and it also facilitates innovation. McKinney
argues that “ways of thinking digitally about information were embedded
in lesbian-feminist work with paper, in the ways lesbian feminists
learned computing and imagined and built networks and databases for
storing and sharing information” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020">(McKinney
2020)</span>. Such innovation continues today in the alternative uses of
digital networks seen during protests like Arab Spring, as well as in
the continued use of analog zines to discuss technological objects like
machine learning (in the Intersectional AI Toolkit or in Elvia
Vasconcelos’s “A Visual Introduction to AI” <span class="citation"
data-cites="vasconcelosVisualIntroductionAI">(Vasconcelos
n.d.)</span>).</p>
<p>Zine publisher, activist, and artist Be Oakley says that part of the
appeal of the zine is that the zine form allows for more egalitarian
access across economic boundaries: “A zine is made to be disseminated to
publics otherwise forgotten by hardcover books. […] Class is built into
its format. A zine communicates a level of accessibility through its
materials and its form. […] A zine evokes a legacy of authorship that is
not exclusively written by straight, cis, white men. […]” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="oakleyImperfectArchivingArchiving2023">(Oakley
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Providing more access can also enable more nuanced access, by setting
access boundaries. Take for example the work of Local Contexts, who help
Indigenous communities protect their data rights by creating tools to
inform researchers of their boundaries. They offer data labels that help
researchers understand how data are meant to be used (and not used)
according to more granular criteria. Rather than using a simple license
agreement, which does not address their needs, Indigenous communities
can reinforce their rights by applying “Traditional Knowledge” and
“Biocultural” labels to data and collections, which provide context,
provenance, metadata, protocols, and permissions for use. These include
designating specific community members or times of year for access, or
designating materials as sacred to the community or open for
collaboration. Local Contexts also provides notices for researchers and
institutions to contextualize their collections with labels like
“Authorization,” “Belonging,” “Caring,” “Gender Aware,” “Leave
Undisturbed,” and others <span class="citation"
data-cites="LocalContextsGrounding">(<span>“Local Contexts – Grounding
Indigenous Rights”</span> n.d.)</span>. The expansiveness of the forms
that a Craft lens can take means that more communities can participate,
but more importantly more communities can participate by creating their
own terms and contexts for participation.</p>

<p>These entanglements wind through material and conceptual spheres,
which micha cárdenas demonstrates with her description of the stitch as
emblematic of lived intersectional feminist work and of all practices of
craft and technology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As sewing is a technique of making that has been used primarily by
women throughout history, and continues to be primarily the task of
women in sweatshops in the global South, […] the stitch as a material
and conceptual operation can be seen as feminist, a way of generating
new concepts by learning from people who have been subject to material
inequalities because of their gender, their race, and their geographic
location. The stitch can be thought of as the basis for a theory of
feminist making, which values the forms of knowledge practiced daily by
oppressed people as they make their lives in the face of violence.”
<span class="citation"
data-cites="cardenasTransColorPoetics2016">(cárdenas 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft expands the definition of what “counts” as creating or
participating in technology, including what labor is valued in the
accounting of it. It destabilizes static ideas of technologies and their
outputs as infallable and handed-down, by reminding us they are in fact
crafted by people and contingent on contexts. The invisible labor of
data creation and data maintenance is no different from the invisible
labor of infrastructure in this way. Yanni Loukissas argues for the
inherently “local” nature of data, saying that “data-driven systems […]
are locally contingent and even fragile. Designs dependent on data must
be maintained and repaired on a regular basis to ensure that they are in
sync with changes in the data themselves or the encompassing
infrastructure of the place. […] When data do seem to confer
transparency, it is because we are shielded from important details about
the context of their creation or display” <span class="citation"
data-cites="loukissasAllDataAre2019">(Loukissas 2019)</span>. Loukissas
suggests the term “data settings” instead of “data sets” to emphasize
the ways data are always shaped by both their creation and their use. He
argues for remembering how data always index something else and are
themselves incomplete. This destabilization of data helps to recall
their human impacts, and it asks us to care for them responsibly within
their shifting contexts as part of various communities and legacies.</p>

<h4>Reentangled theory and practice</h4>
<p>Practice and theory are tangibly intertwined in craft. While craft is
not the only domain where theory and practice merge, it is useful to
draw on craft metaphorically and literally of how it merges the two
accessibly while reaching across domains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The protocols of knitting are thus situated <em>in-between</em> the
looped thread, in the loops themselves. This interconnection protocol of
the thread could be seen as a catalyst, as it produces a bigger whole
from the single thread. […] One could say that the protocol of the
looped thread ‘echoes’ throughout the final knitted piece as the
catalyst produces the conditions for emergent behavior (the inter-loops
of the thread).” <span class="citation"
data-cites="vonbuschZenAbstractMachine2013">(Von Busch 2013)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craft shows — through maker processes — how doing becomes being and
being becomes doing. It may seem too simple but it is important: As
actions of making yield creations, craft reemphasizes the making
alongside objects made. It shows how theories of objects (be they media,
tech, or craft objects) emerge from and are embedded in the actions that
produce them. Attending to craft as process — and to technology as its
processes, its people, its protocols — expands beyond the crafting of
objects to include communities of practice and sociotechnical systems:
“as in crafting an identity, or crafting a community” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="fountainSurvivalKnittestCraft2021">(Fountain
2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Craft is also means of thought. Textile designer Nithikul Nimkulrat
describes craft, “not only as a way of making things by hand, but also
as a way of thinking through the hand manipulating a material.” She
suggests that in craft, thinking is a sensory act, inextricable from
doing. “Knowledge of a creative practice thus lies in and can be
acquired from within the practice itself. In other words, thinking and
knowing are inseparable from making in any craft or designerly
practices.” This makes it imbued with responsibility to ourselves and
each other.</p>
<p>These are not metaphors only. They are material, infrastructural
systems that undergird and uphold power — woven into the warp and weft
of all processes. With fiber art this is literal, and it demonstrates
concretely the ways these processes operate in other mediums too.
Cyberfeminist Sadie Plant says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[Garments] process and store data. Because there is no difference
between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as
records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women
worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The
visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the
program and the pattern are continuous.” <span class="citation"
data-cites="plantZerosOnes1998">(Plant 1998)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Echoes of this concept can be seen in current research methods like
Critical Code Studies, an approach to reading code that situates it
within its material, cultural contexts rather than viewing it as a
neutral static object <span class="citation"
data-cites="marinoCriticalCodeStudies2020a">(Marino 2020)</span>.
Through such material reckonings, we can not only use different lenses
to reflect on existing technologies but also gain the means to reimagine
them for different purposes. As queer craft art historian Daniel
Fountain says, “craft, or more broadly the notion of crafting, is an
essential strategy for living and loving ‘otherwise’” <span
class="citation"
data-cites="fountainSurvivalKnittestCraft2021">(Fountain 2021)</span>.
What does this ‘otherwise’ look like and how does it come about?</p>
<p>Artist-researchers Ren Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard call for
“queer playfulness and promiscuous metaphorical practice” that can
expand beyond passive strategies for remaking technoscience, reusing its
terms in order to imagine new forms: “as a speculative practice of
working with metaphor, we propose to replace CS (Computer Science) with
CS (Careful Slugs), forthcoming could be CS (Cushions and Stargazing),
CS (Crying Sabotage), and/or CS (Chancer Scientist). We propose that the
metaphors of Careful Slugs might create possibilities for new kinds of
work in Computer Science. Possibilities in which unknowing itself become
disoriented, disassembled, and undone in its conventional forms.” They
suggest that metaphor can be a powerful tool for finding gaps and
expanding cracks in violent structures, and that metaphor works in
concert with not in lieu of material practices, to restructure physical
systems. “Through working with metaphor, we generate a series of
speculative fictions for CS––Careful Slugs stories that reconfigure
relations and introduce scandals and chances into Computer Science,
Design, and STS processes that might lead to other sorts of project
plans, research questions, and technical inquiries”<span

<h4>Refusal &amp; material resistance</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>“Make technology ridiculous.” &gt;–Nam June Paik, <em>We Are in Open
Circuits</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Handcraft can emphasize the “NO” in technology as a resistance or
refusal to operate by the terms and conditions of technology as it has
been handed down: inaccessible, obtuse, large-scale, platformatized,
proprietary, profit-seeking, and so on. Technological tools need not be
the purview of only the narrow band of [users/creators/?] with the most
access, and ‘craftiness’ is both an intellectual and a material strategy
in response. Although craft approaches are also applied in other
contexts, when they are used as methods for refusal they also can become
forms of “tactical media.”</p>
<p>Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse, reimagine
their materials to engage political potentials. As “an investment in a
multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions,”
says Rita Raley, “tactical media activities provide models of opposition
rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau
reminds us, ‘itself remains intact’.” The technological gestures of
tactical media artworks operate in the world as it is now, while
reflecting upon, resisting, and offering alternatives to it. Raley says
that tactica media is a “mutable category” that includes “practices such
as reverse engineering, hacktivism, […] the digital hijack, […]
collaborative software, and open-access technology labs […]” <span
class="citation" data-cites="raleyTacticalMedia2009">(Raley
2009)</span>. In its many forms, tactical media [(like craft)] consists
not only of its material objects, but also its communities, networks,
protocols, and processes of disturbance and resistance.</p>
<p>Crafters and other artists know that resistance can emerge from the
properties of the materials themselves, and that creation is a
cooperative effort between maker and material. Digital humanities
researcher Bethany Nowviskie argues that this resistance is a reminder
of “the material nature of every generative or transformative textual
process” most useful when makers have deep knowledge of their
environment, including the time and access allows them to make and
refine their own tools: “the material nature of every generative or
transformative textual process” <span class="citation"
data-cites="nowviskieResistanceMaterials2013">(Nowviskie
2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Queer use is a form of resistance, both material resistance and
cultural resistance. It can be a way of ‘living otherwise’ and might be
read in some cases as a form of tactical media. Feminist writer Sara
Ahmed describes queer use as both a refusal of normative use and an
embrace of the unused:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To queer use is to linger on the material qualities of that which
you are supposed to pass over; it is to recover a potential from
materials that have been left behind, all the things you can do with
paper if you refuse the instructions. That recovery can be dangerous.
The creativity of queer use becomes an act of destruction, whether
intended or not; not digesting something, spitting it out; putting it
about.” <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmedQueerUse2018">(Ahmed
2018)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ahmed’s reading, normative use and resistance has much to do with
fit and form: “I think of an institution as an old garment: it has
acquired the shape of those who tend to wear it such that it is easier
to wear if you have that shape. And this is why I think of privilege as
an energy saving device; less effort is required to pass through when a
world has been assembled around you” <span class="citation"
data-cites="ahmedQueerUse2018">(Ahmed 2018)</span>. In a machine
learning parlance, we might say that infrastructures and institutions
are overfitting for select populations — not only overrepresenting them
but designed to suit them — while unable to account for others. With the
capacity to craft our own garments, technologies, systems, institutions,
we can create new fits.</p>

<p>Let’s briefly discuss some techniques employed in craftiness as
refusal and resistance: adversarial use, extreme use, handcraft
practices, and esoteric/DIY systems. These techniques often overlap,
reflect one another, or are used in tandem. Of course they are not the
only techniques, but a few I have spotted in the wild and have used
myself.</p>
<p><strong>Adversarial use</strong> uses technology against the grain or
against the goals of its creators.
<!--In ["Autonomous Trap 001"](https://www.jamesbridle.com/works/autonomous-trap-001), James Bridle used a salt circle drawn in the pattern of highway lines to show how a self-driving car might be trapped in one spot by its own rules, nodding to ritual magic while showing the ease with which 'smart' systems could potentially be fooled [@bridleAutonomousTrap001] (see also the code for developing a DIY self driving vehicle, [Austeer](https://github.com/stml/austeer?tab=readme-ov-file).-->
In an obfuscation technique called ‘baysean flooding’, machine-reading
platforms are prevented from interpreting data by mixing in an
overwhelming amount of false data which cannot be distinguished from
‘true’ data — such as posting a thousand nonsense social media posts
with false locations for every accurate one <span class="citation"
data-cites="bruntonObfuscationUserGuide2015">(Brunton and Nissenbaum

I created a bot to participate in misogynist online forums in order to
post feminist texts, then collected the responses from forum
participants and performed these responses at poetry readings. Both are
examples of adversarial use <span class="citation"
data-cites="cistonLadymouthAntiSocialMediaArt2019">(Ciston 2019)</span>.
Other forms might also include desire lines, the non-designated paths in
parks and natural spaces that are created by human or animal use.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme use</strong>, also known as breaking, looks to what
is already broken, concerning, or confusing in existing systems and
plunges into those gulfs. By highlighting (or causing) errors and
glitches, these works step into the trouble. They hyperbolize aspects of
a system in order to attend to the problems this exposes. In her
“Manifesto of the Broken Machine,” Sarah Sharma shows how we might work
<em>with</em> outliers and errors — and with perceptions of women and
others as outliers and errors — in order to work <em>against</em> the
systems that frame them as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the idea of our contemporary social-political-economic system as an
already-broken machine full of the incompatibly queer, raced, classed,
and sexed broken-down machines is politically exciting for feminism. […]
A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the
machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to
pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves.”

<p><strong>Handcraft practices</strong> may involve craft tools or may
involve handcraft approaches taken up with high-tech materials, or both!
In <a
href="https://anuradhareddy.com/Internet-of-Towels-Knotty-Articulations">“The
Internet of Towels — Knotty Articulations”</a>, Anuradha Reddy used the
process of crocheting a towel to study lenticular images and the

when viewed from an angle, can be read as a valid QR code by a QR reader
or phone <span class="citation"

Papa documented her work as a human trainer for AI systems in <a
href="http://www.elisagiardinapapa.org/"><em>Leaking Subjects &amp;
Bounding Boxes: On Training AI</em></a>, collecting images and
instructions from some of the thousands of tasks she was assigned “which
seemed to resist AI’s orderly impulse.” By turning this labor-intensive
work into an art object, the book asks its readers to reconsider the
work of classification as a handcraft <span class="citation"
data-cites="EGP">(<span>“EGP”</span> n.d.)</span>. In <a
href="https://sarahciston.com/anarchies.html">“No Knots, Only
Loops”</a>, I documented the months I took to produce a crochet
sculpture. The work offers a tangible means to grappled with the uncanny
scale of large language models, by comparing the number of stitches in a
huge sculpture to the number of parameters in a model (finding them
still insufficient to “model” the model).</p>
<p><strong>Esoteric systems</strong>, or DIY systems, are often a
response from artists or communities when they cannot find the tools or
resources they need in existing forms or formats. Creating their own
alternatives in response to the lack they perceive, artists’ esoteric
systems can be inventive and generative, investigative and critical, or
justice-seeking and recooperative, among other things. In <a
href="https://kayserifserif.place/work/coem/">“Coem”</a>, Katherine Yang
created an esoteric programming language that “imagines poetry as
purposeful and code as emotional,” working against general-purpose
languages that prioritize efficiency over feeling. Developing a language
with different core values demonstrates how value systems drive code
design and inform the functions a language allows as well as what
operations and outputs it can produce <span class="citation"
data-cites="yangCoem">(Yang, n.d.)</span>. In <a
href="https://paglen.studio/2020/04/29/imagenet-roulette/">“ImageNet
Roulette”</a>, Kate Crawford and Trevor Paglan created an interface for
exploring a popular dataset used in many machine learning foundation
models, in order to reveal the dataset’s problematic taxonomies that
classified people as, for example, “slattern, slut, slovenly woman,
trollop” or “failure, loser, non-starter, unsuccessful person” <span
class="citation" data-cites="crawfordExcavatingAIPolitics2019">(Crawford
and Paglen 2019)</span>. By building a system that let public audiences
explore the dataset in an accessible way, they could bring personal
understanding to the issues with how such datasets are created and used
in many kinds of machine learning tasks. In my upcoming research project
<a href="https://unsupervisedpleasures">“Unsupervised Pleasures”</a>,
developed in collaboration with Emily Martinez, we are developing
alternative approaches to conscientious dataset development based on
intersectional principles and practices, in hopes that these shift the
outputs when applied to language models (and as a provocation for
imagining different model architectures as well).</p>
<p>These forms of refusal replace what they reject with alterative
visions for more liberatory technologies. Creative and social computing
scholar and activist Dan McQuillan argues current AI systems exacerbates
existing aspects of society that act violently to exclude and enclose.
He calls for an anti-facist approach to AI that can
[enact/enforce/instantiate] “a positive refusal, a rejection of certain
forms of apparatus and a commitment to radical alternatives. […] Our
ambition should stretch beyond the timid idea of AI governance, which
accepts what we’re already being subjected to, and instead look to
transform our apparatuses into a technical practice that supports the
common good” <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist">(McQuillan n.d.)</span>. We
can start with looking at how existing models, methods, and
methodologies indicate the changes that need to be made, not in the
models alone but in the world, argues digital democracy scholar Wendy H.
K. Chun: “Machine learning and predictive models as they currently exist
can also resist reduction, but only if we treat the gaps between their
results and our realties as spaces for political action, not errors to
be fixed. [We need to treat these models as we do global climate change
models. GCC models offer us the most probable future, given past
actions, not so that we accept that future, but so we work to change it.
Only global climate change deniers seek to fix the model, rather than
the world.]” <span class="citation"
data-cites="chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021">(Chun 2021)</span>.
As Chun and McQuillan suggest, we need more than the mere governance of
emerging technologies as they are currently conceived, and instead
require moves towards prefigurative practices. <!-- abolition --> Crafty
tactical media can queer the use of machine learning systems and other
emergent technologies in order to reveal their classificatory,
reductionist logics. By applying techniques like aversarial use, extreme
use, handcraft practices, and esoteric systems, a craft lens helps
imagine and enact “a committment to radical alternatives.” As
trans*formative systems suggests, such alternatives already exist, if we
are willing to write, build, create, and cooperate in ways that reveal
them and allow them to flourish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Embracing the nuances of crafted art forms […] exemplifies the
non-linear, embodied, diffractive ways of reading, interpreting, and
understanding the world while questioning what AI tools can do and the
extent to which craftspeople have a say in what AI tools should be doing
instead. I contend that AI does not produce newness but rather ‘newly’
suggests how craftspeople have always been creative agents for shaping
the future of culturally and visually-informed algorithmic systems.”

<!-- >"What's unique about such IFH/MSs [intersectional feminist hacker/makerspaces] is that they are designed specifically to meet the needs and interests of the communities they are by and for, thereby allowing for a truly revolutionary *reimagining* of a 'different concatenation of social forms, knowledge, and technology'. In so doing, IFH/MS members articulate a strategy of hacking not only software and hardware, but their own social reproduction within the cybersphere."

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.

  - >"holds in suspicion the prestige the commons concept has attained in the US and theory-cosmopolitan context, often signifying an ontology that merely needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up to it. Although the commons claim sounds like an uncontestably positive aim, the concept in this context threatens to cover over the very complexity of social jockeying and interdependence it responds to by delivering a conﬁrming aﬀective surplus in advance of the lifeworld it’s also seeking. [...] the attachment to this concept is too often a way of talking about politics as the resolution of ambivalence and the vanquishing of the very contingency of nonsovereign standing that is at the heart of true equality, [...] 
  - >**"the commons concept is a powerful vehicle for troubling troubled times. [...] The better power of the commons is to point to a way to view what’s broken in sociality, the diﬃculty of convening a world conjointly, although it is inconvenient and hard, and to offer incitements to imagining a livable provisional life."**

#### Key forms & foundational concepts of generative AI systems explained

[see also AI basics FAQ in IAIT]

#### Classification logics

- Pervasive capture, data colonialism: 
  - >"the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,' into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction." (Nick Couldry & Ulises A. Mejias  [@couldryMakingDataColonialism2019])
- Garbage in, garbage out: 
  - Conscientious collection methods, values and questions 
  - Proprietary, missing, indecipherable data, practices and documentation
  - Labor:
    - "The data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour" [@ExclusiveHourWorkers]
    - "ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent," Andrew Strait
    - "Automation runs on the averaged microjudgments of whole detachments of underpaid humans, not some supersmart computer." [Steyerl (2022) @steyerlMeanImages2023]
- Unacknowledged curation: 
  - >"All of these attempts to harmonize and create general descriptive languages are founded on a universalizing logic that in its most utopian dimensions believes that these political and infrastructural differences that stand in the way of classification are accidental and can ultimately be overcome." [Justin Joque (2015) @joqueDataCreationMeaning2015]
- Data bodies, algorithmic race & gender, the problem of representation: 
  - "your algorithmic gender may well contradict your own identity, needs, and values. Google’s gender is a gender of profitable convenience" (John Cheney-Lippold, We Are Data @cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017)
  - whose data are (not) included:
    - "we need to interrogate not only the security of our data but  [...] What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to [a boutique self-tracking device], the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?" (Jacqueline Wernimont, Numbered Lives [@wernimontNumberedLivesLife2018])
    - whose stories are these? "what subject position allows us to ethically occupy, flourish, and move in a world of pervasive data monitoring? (Natasha Dow Schull)
- Worldbuilding with data: 
  - “Database design, in that way, is 'an exercise in worldbuilding,' a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views—a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race." [@benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019]
- Uncertainty reduced to certainty 
  - >>"If uncertainty is the ability for the unknown to be accounted for by comporting to containment under the logics of algorithmic models, then what can unknowability offer instead? [...]["BLACKNESS as space of ethical absence," "the unknown as a subject"] Unknowability born from the figure of the flesh opens the space for ways of understanding the world that are otherwise discounted because of their inability to be neatly measured and accounted for. It is the place in which irresolution is allowed to reside." (Morrison 2021, 255) >>"flesh becomes an essential outlier from which to assess the limitations of sociotechnical fixes. Flesh is the poignant, unavoidable signifier and text upon which to read the history and reality of total expropriation of value from bodies and land." (255) [@morrisonFlesh2021]
- Displaced agency, diffused responsibility
- Bias transfer:
  - "bias transfer both (a) arises in realistic settings (such as when pre-training on ImageNet or other standard datasets) and (b) can occur even when the target dataset is explicitly de-biased" @salmanWhenDoesBias2022


>"computers were humans (mostly women), and digital computers were primarily used for complex calculations, especially in wartime military contexts.

<!-- In deep interdisciplinary practice in classrooms, necessarily, "the topic of inquiry emerged as primary and our institutionally-created selves emerged as secondary" [@mcclellanDeepInterdisciplinarityCritical2014]

TERM: *Deep Interdisciplinarity* is able to view these fundamental states as hybrid, not only different fields or concepts but the core ways of seeing/being/becoming. The approach of constantly shifting lenses and destabilizing and viewing as spectra. Ontologically interdisciplinary. (not ontology or being but becoming, process philosophy). Bakhtin’s heteroglossia ("another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way" (1934)) and polyphony.

>"As with chess, knitting starts with the same point of departure, and all games and knits start with the same set-up. But turing the process, even within the limits of rigit protocols, the moves diverge very rapidly [...]. new tactics in chess constantly evolve and every new master beats the previous, not because of superior intelligence, but through the development of new techniques and tactics, actualized within these vast possibilities.
