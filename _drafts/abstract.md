This dissertation *Trans\*formative TechnoCraft* proposes how AI can be more accessible and tangible, less intimidating and harmful through the adoption of intersectional, interdisciplinary interventions. It presents several examples of such interventions

Through intersectional lenses, artistic research, critical窶田reative 

Through artistic research, critical窶田reative coding and the creation of communities of practice around critical窶田reative coding. 

I find that coding communities which are founded based on practices of queerness and transness (its ethics, tactics, ways of being) can open those communities as more radical spaces of belonging. It can activate them ...


"A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" offers practical guidance for conscientious dataset stewardship. It combines critical AI theories and technical data science concepts, explained in accessible language. It is paired with the "Inclusive Datasets Research Guide," an online resource written for USC Libraries. Both of these texts apply concepts from the "Intersectional AI Toolkit," which argues that anyone should be able to understand what AI is and help shape what AI ought to be. The Toolkit's co-authored zines are accessible guides to both AI and intersectionality. They find common vocabularies to connect diverse communities around AI's urgent questions. Its online resources learn from legacies of queer, feminist, antiracist, anticolonialist, and antiablest theories, ethics, and tactics, showing how established but marginalized tactics are necessary for reimagining more critical and ethical machine learning. "Coding.Care: Field Notes for Making Friends with Code" describes critical窶田reative programming approaches founded in the belief that anyone can contribute to the future of digital systems and that we all have skills to teach each other. It gives courage to pick up unfamiliar tools, find resources to kick off a new programming project, pose questions critically, or solve problems creatively. Its pocket-guide form discusses how to build a cooperative, interdisciplinary community for co-learning coding. As interstices between these texts, five lyric essays approach the topics of [XXX] from oblique angles. "Codes for (Un)Raveling," "Codes for (Un)Limiting, "Codes for (Un)Forming," "Codes for (Un)Living," and "Codes for (Un)Knowing" converse with five artists working primarily in 20th century analog materials, asking how these practices reflect on contemporary digital questions considered within *Trans\*formative Technocraft*. These essays (un)do the lived experience of [XXX] technology which [XXX] addresses. 

Because different modalities can better address and unite a wider range of communities, these works make interventions with different audiences by relying upon different voices, forms, formats, and media to address different stages of the sociotechnical pipelines that produce algorithmic systems like generative AI. "A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" and "Inclusive Datasets Research Guide" address journalists, students, scholars, activists, artists, and anyone starting to work with existing machine learning datasets, in the form of an instructional guidebook that combines approachable techniques with critical thinking interventions, at the point when they are choosing, using, and maintaining datasets as the foundation for machine learning tasks. Intersectional AI Toolkit addresses anyone who wants to understand the automated systems that impact them by using public workshops, zines, and digital resources in order to describe key concepts and processes of machine learning through critical lenses. "Coding.Care" addresses reluctant or would-be programmers (of any age), with a warm and friendly pocketbook, at the moment where they might intervene with critical or imaginative software creation. The "Codes" essays are nonpedagogical and address nonpractitioners on a more affective and aesthetic register, meant for reflection on the impact of sociotechnical systems as they entangle with individuals and marginalized groups. 

#### Design

They are produced through an ethos of process-oriented practice. The programming text is written alongside the composition text, giving them more equal weight.
Every draft is saved in a Git versioning system and all are available open-access online, making no version the 'definitive' or 'authoritative' version.

Markdown -> Pandoc -> LaTex -> HTML
         -> Git             -> PDF

Written in Markdown, a basic, flexible text format that allows for easy reformatting and for multiple forms and outputs. The same text creates the website, the dissertation draft, and the zine booklet PDF for printing, using the command line tool Pandoc and LaTex templates.

This process of combining existing tools in new ways (duct tape methodology) is a Coding.Care strategy.
