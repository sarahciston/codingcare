# Codes for disappearing/isolating, perfecting: Scratching at the walls
## Rebecca Horn's "Berlin, 1974" and COVID-19 isolation, now



We are scratching at the walls. We are reaching for something we cannot grasp. 
She makes her arms the width of the room. A ship in a bottle. She expands to fit the space, traps herself (or trapped?) and scratches on all sides. The room becomes a body and the body becomes a room we live inside. (I always say "the" body instead of "mine" or "your" as if the body is a thing I can keep away from myself. But here I am in my own achey body, keeping it away from everyone but myself, as it keeps testing positive for COVID and doesn't have much energy for anything but bad television.

We listen. That slow scratch intermittent and endless alike. Pterodactylian. Pterodactyl Dexterous Pterodaxterous. Her body stiffened into a wooden crafted cyborg catwalk. She walks the line. She fully unfolds, extends.

This is a piece about isolation. Sparse, minimalist. Quarantine. We have phrases for this feeling of entrapment - literal "nails on a chalkboard" or "clawing at the walls" or "climbing up the walls." 

I stand at the window like a trapped red light district dancer, but I'm only having groceries delivered and I'm clawing the glass of this unglamorous mermaid tank.

Rebecca is talking, clacking with her parrot eye. We are both stuck inside and clucking with nonspecific rage. When I view this I get prickly, my pores tingle. The sound makes me taller. I stretch and wriggle to get it out of and into my body at once, moving it vertically down my spine and out my limbs.

These performances for film were made this time of year exactly, 1974–75. They don't seem 47 years old, but then I no longer know how long I've been in here.
It would take exactly two sets of my own wingspan, measuring six feet and permanently attached to my trunk, to span this room and reach both walls at once. But I am only one. When I reach out I already fill half the room. The gaps on either side are absence (of company) but not space (to breathe).

I think of Nest, the camera that people willingly place in or at the entrances to their homes, and

How we only see Horn's body from outside the portal of the doorframe, narrowing the film frame toward her own frame.
How we only see Horn's body from outside the doorway, a portal to the space she makes new appendages to fill. Petals, Dactyls, Scaffolds, come into view as she makes distance from the camera/doorframe (frame and lens and I as one) scrapes along the walls.

In different exercises, she performs parts of birdliness. The cluck and clatter and curiosity. The cagedness. This nesting. Birds and cages and cameras and sensors. What kind of home is a cage, a trap, an enclosure. 1970s Soviet Berlin and 2020s United States.

>it's the definition of making work with constraints and restraints
COVID wings, a data extension using pulse oximeter and heart rate variability
the sheer effort to lift and repeatedly manipulate those wings just so. how increasingly aching her rhomboids must become. The way her elbows crook at right angles is birdlike.

I tried to stretch my labyrinth out in the house, too large for the room where I live. I could fold it to work on a small portion at a time, or hang it on a wall and project onto a portion of it. But art has changed in confinement.

How bodies conform to spaces, given. The expand to fit, they expand beyond. They fold inward. The Baroque fold (Deleuze) the ornate, the decorative, the feminine, Her balsa scratches reminiscent of the melted ineffective scaffolding of past wings.

to parrot, mirror, mimic
I made a tiny labyrinth on my floor instead, folded the 12' space into 3' beside the bed where I put my feet each morning when I wake. A labyrinth is a way of folding a large distance into a small one, folding an interior exploration, a wander, into an exterior path, a journey.

How I don't fit into the bath, not with all parts. Space and body and volume of container and liquid. Archimedes in the tub, and doing things wrong, or not "right enough." Displacement.

codes for disappearing, isolating, perfecting, sequestering, sequelae. what is the relation between isolate and perfect, singular and generatable.
how we want to draw out features from a set to make rules to control and identify people. we characterize to tell stories and make new characters, which is useful (storytelling, general to specific). but when we apply stereotypes to existing people it's dangerous (going the wrong direction, specific to general, AI). an individual contains multitude of features, is not reducible.

This is an essay about LIMITS. (which is about boundaries) and perfection (which is about insecurity). Protocols are limits, are codes.

twinkling.
the tongue clacking like this keyboard clattering as I type about it. the strange intimacies/things we get up to in isolation. the bird's indifference, then distress, against the wall then the window. 

The COVID confinement / queer urge to do your own haircut. To bind yourself to your partner with magnets and perform a three-legged race against yourselves. To curl up and stare into each others faces. To U-Haul under the premise it's only going to be three to six weeks not three years.
