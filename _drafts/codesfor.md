Codes for Disappearing
Isolation, Perfection, Scratching at the Walls

[Rebecca Horn, Berlin (10 Nov. 1974–28 Jan. 1975) - Exercises in nine parts: Dreaming under water of things afar (40min, Vimeo)](https://vimeo.com/562736859)
This is about L I M I T S. About protocols. How to make a trap an O A S I S. How to fold up inside oneself, like a nucleotide, bonding and curling.
We are scratching at the walls. We are reaching for something we cannot grasp.
Make your arms the width of the room. We are ships in bottles. We are messages, out to sea. All that plexiglass, more surface for smearing, unrecyclable, to divide all space into infinitesimally smaller spaces, room for even more rooms. 
The room becomes a body and the body becomes a room we live inside.
I always say "the" body instead of "my" body, as if the body is a thing I can keep away from myself. But "I am in here" in this achey thing, and it is my job to keep it away from everyone but myself. It keeps being positive but I am not. 
Listen. Slow scratch, endless, intermittent, insistent. Rebecca, how do you expand to fill the space, so willing to trap yourself? You are pterodexterous. You articulate. Body stiffened into a wooden cyborg catwalk, you fully unfold, extend, walk the line. 
Each trip your trip gets shorter, fatigue more visible: Twenty steps, then fifteen, then ten, ten again, then eight. Two and half laps, cross, stop, turn and cross again. I feel your aching shoulder blades in my own, your mirrored arms, your replicating shadows. I wonder if you're noticing your steps lengthening or distance across the floor shrinking.
Your body only appears to me from outside the portal of the doorframe, further narrowing the film frame toward your own frame. Keep that space between us; the space is a portal into new appendages to fill the distance. Dactyls, scaffolds, folding, frames. More comes into view as you makes distance from the frame. Is this an idea about folding and unfolding? A Deleuzian theory of the Baroque? 
At each scratch of your extended digits scraping the walls I get prickly; my pores tingle. Its sound makes me taller. Is it sounding from within my head? I stretch and wriggle to get it out of and into my body at once, squirming to push it down my spine and out my limbs.
It would take exactly two of my own wingspan, measuring six feet and permanently attached to my trunk, to span this room and reach both walls at once. But I have only one. Still, when I reach out I already fill half of this small room in 2020s Los Angeles. The gaps on either side are absence (of company) but not space (to breathe).
Did I tell you that I am moving to Berlin? To 1974, to this white cube of a room, where I can leave my own white cube of a room and the 2020s, and be no places at once.
You made these exercises at this time of year exactly. They don't seem 47 years old, but then I don't know how long I've been in here. 
This is also about isolation. We already have too-literal phrases for this feeling: "nails on a chalkboard" or "climbing up the walls" or "clawing my eyes out." 

I tried to stretch my labyrinth out inside my house, too large for the room. It was suggested I fold it to work on a small portion at a time, or hang it on a wall. I made a tiny labyrinth on the floor instead, folded the 12' space into less than 3' beside the bed, right where I land my feet each morning when I wake. A labyrinth is a way of folding a large distance into a small one, folding an interior exploration (a wander) into an exterior path (a journey). Still, most days I usually just walk straight over it rather than following its twists and turns. 

[Different folks have different definitions of isolation, of hardship, of covering your face. The CDC says… …each life unrecognizable from last month's life…] 

Rebecca, I keep dreaming of your rhomboids and the concerted effort to lift and manipulate those wings just so. Your increasing ache, the way your elbows crook at right angles, birdlike.
You keep clacking at your cockatoo with your one parrot eye. I get it. Just the strange, intimate things we get up to when stuck inside and clucking with nonspecific rage. I stand at the window like a trapped red light district dancer, but I'm only getting food delivered and I'm clawing at the glass of this unglamorous fish tank and I'm trying to mimic you trying to mimic your bird. I'm thinking of Nest and Blink, the brandnames of cameras people willingly place in or at the entrances to their homes, and all the security cameras outside my apartment building right now-probably capturing this three-day-old outfit. I would like to call this some kind of feminist art practice. 
You seem to be becoming-animal in bits and birdseed. Performing parts of birdliness. Parrot, mimic, mirror. Your cluck and clatter and curiosity, twinkling dark whimsy. Birds and cagedness and cameras and sensors. 
Bodies must conform to the space allotted, at a border in a cage, at a boundary of identity, a limit of language or an encoded protocol. They expand to fit, or contort and fold inward. It's the definition of making work with constraints and restraints, right?
Rebecca, your Baroque balsa fingers are giving me the feminine folds of a framework for melted, ineffectual past wings. Your new dactyls were measured exactly to match the specifications of your room. You hold them with careful tenderness and confidence in equal measure. 
I am continually confused by this body of mine, which won't simultaneously and in its entirety fit within my standard-sized bathtub. Which one of us is normal? Archimedes in the tub, discovering how to measure density, displacing himself into liquid. Crash-test dummies that only save standard-issue, 1970s-era 5'9" 170-pound men. 
There's a longstanding argument in my family about the importance of accuracy versus precision. What would be perfect enough? Right enough? 
What is the relationship between isolation and perfection? Am I trying to narrow this down too much? 
I saw a meme that said, "Hugh Jackman said, 'You're not a perfectionist. When have you ever done anything perfectly? You're just insecure.' And it really hit me, you know?" That was the whole meme.
And it really did hit me, you know? I was today years old when I realized doing things perfectly was not in fact possible. It wasn't merely that I had been falling short this whole time.
So I guess this is about insecurity, too. About boundaries. About codes. About sensitivities and machines.
When we tell stories, we use everything we know about everyone we've ever met to imagine new characters. From those generalizations, we draw out some specific features and apply them to an imagined new person. Hopefully we flesh those out enough, combining them in unique ways and adding situations and motivations that make the new person feel full and fleshy too. 
But when we move the other direction-from specific to general-oh, boy, that spells trouble. When we use artificial intelligence (statistics on steroids), we draw out generalizations about existing individuals by selecting for only a few features about them that we've decided are important, and then we apply them to other individuals. Whether or not these assumptions are "correct" according to the machine's calculations is not the only concern (though a huge one). First, they are built on fundamentally false, stereotyping categories. Further, they reduce the unique, irreducible multitude of features that exists within each person. These generalizations are rules used to identify, sort, and control all of us-to sometimes dangerous ends.
[What does this black box have to do with the white rooms we are in? ]
[My datasets make me anxious, constantly extruding, producing. Somehow it's still easier to say "my datasets" than "my body."]
[Sequelae are the secondary effects after symptoms abate. They are consequences. Of sequestering ourselves, of]
[What would the COVID–era wings run on? Pulse oximeter readings or XXXX?]
Sequestering ourselves. 
Rebecca, why are you stuck inside? It's winter when you are, and I don't know which side of Berlin you're on. Are you sequestering yourself for political reasons as well, or meteorological or creative ones. People don't just come up with the idea to cut their own hair with two pairs of scissors or to paint themselves green and squiggle around behind their houseplants on camera if they haven't been stuck inside for a bit. 
Who among us has not in the last two years stood before a mirror in fear of the haircut you gave yourself in this Übung? The queer confinement urge to give yourself a haircut, to bind yourself to a partner with magnets, to gaze into the middle-distance of each other's facetimes with a hundred other windows open. I am always impending. Re-emergency, re-emergency, re-emergency.

[your tiny fish swim in chest hair and at least have someone to play with, though every natural element is wired up and artificial, whimsical but somehow contingent and machined]
