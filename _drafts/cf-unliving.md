The smooth silence of drone footage over destruction. The glide above bombs and voice over. 


I am still alive, On Kawara. I think about your postcards often. I find your dailiness remarkable. What it takes to get up in the morning. What it takes to make a painting, a life, a day after day. 

<!-- A simple act of reporting. Distributing data, is always personal.  -->

What I like about you is you don't offer any context. Just 'I got up'. Just 'I am still alive'. What more do you want from me, you seem to say. 

You wrote to Sol Lewitt, to XXXXX and XXXXX. I'll write to you. I am also still alive. It doesn't feel remarkable, but I mark it, remark it. Some people I know are also alive but don't want to be. It's hard to know how to live, especially right now. And it always has been hard to know how to live. But we make our problems our own. We evade oneness daily through simple acts like 'I'.

Data accumulates days.

You chose a a few basic rituals and stuck with them. All you needed to say was, "I am still alive." Sometimes the only affirmation we can hold is "I am still alive." Sometimes it is all we can stand. Sometimes we can't even stand that. Sometimes that is enough. Sometimes even that is too much.

I got up at 9:50am. I woke up several times before that. You also have a postcard series about this, and the times range wildly. 

I felt young and girlish when I made art with data. I got comments like, "Are you depressed? You sure do sleep a lot." I think I slept about the same as you, On Kawara. I'm sure we were both read into. And that was the point, but I still didn't like the feeling. Your context was the daily paper, a postcard of a skyscraper, a telegram. My context was an ipad screen, reading theory, [XXX]. 

<!-- [XXX These read differently if you know us (and if you don't). We are each read into differently (as many other important scholars have said).] -->

<!-- I am yearning for this repetition; I find it in loops of fiber. -->

<!-- I want to fill a room with e-ink screens and  -->

Later I made artworks that asked people to bring their data with them. I asked for compassion, in small portable phrases — ones that could be turned from sound into writing into data packets into sound again. 

I got a tattoo on my arm written in calculator font that says "IT'S OKAY TO CRY," after the song by Sophie Xeon. SOPHIE died in 2021 when she slipped and fell while climbing up to look at the moon. My tattoo artist [Ren] created a series of flash pieces honoring her life and work as a musician, producer, and trans rights activist. 

The affirmation "IT'S OKAY TO CRY" had already appeared in the database of compassionate phrases I built. I remember being surprised by the database, both that others would contribute and at its effectiveness at soothing me, even as this is what I built it to do. I am still surprised whenever I operate the device. 

Adrian Piper was handing out business cards letting people know they had made racist remarks and that she was a Black woman. 

A new Boolean in Javascript is called Nullish, written `??`. My feelings exactly. Nullish is meant for "when there are multiple ways something can not exist" (evelyn masso “Handling Null”). Nullish distinguishes `null` and `undefined` from other `False` and `NaN`, although all of these are 'Falsy'. Nullish hovers liminially in the never was or maybe erased. Use plain ol' `null` "when something can optionally exist." Oh to be a Nullable coalescing, there or nothing (masso, Sedgwick).

who decides these things, the poetics of code standards societies


What does it mean to remind you (or me) that I am still alive? For audre lorde this is an act of revolution just even to live in spite of powerful forces that strive to extinguish you. Many of us [others] live on the backs of other people. Others love as [acts of devotion/devotional acts].
