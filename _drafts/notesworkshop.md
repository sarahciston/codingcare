# L

- appreciate sharing something not finished
- things that don't exist yet, how to have diff ways to get to them. e.g. with new languages. lots of sentences like that rich and interesting, love to know more from ppl who have those moments or from more theoretical abstract thoughts i have about those languages, to learn more about it bc there's room for examples. the voices of the ppl i speak with regularly. interv and quites and maybe their work and how we get their together. another way to document. asking w hands in dirt, lead to interesting ways of showing. 

# E
-  use of we, who is it, why do we enunciate as we, would be useful. maybe bc working w diff levels of skill is an entry point. knowing who is we is the question. in guidebook move between i and we. intentional or process. 
- want to see examples of creations, visuals ground things
- content is perfect, like the process. want to know more. considering who is writing. 
- form: parts that are in color, feels like you can click and go see what they're about, don't take you there. because we're used to hyperlink. 

# V

- prospectus kind of has what she was thinking, at parts of manifesto could point to project (zines). when you have comment in manifesto re theory/practice, use one of project as exemplary and each becomes case study of how you see it functioning. lead to project. 

# S

- absolute fav sentence. "making is always a research question about how to live" has everything that is then opened up in diff parts. also made me tink generally about imap projects. how does it evolve for each of us. 
- curious what are next steps, how to build further web site. generally

- manifesto, should be electrifying in a way the guidebook is. gb has better built in call for doing and being there w whole heart. manifesto feels more like the theoretical not really but introduction to the guidebook. kind of hybrid- manifesto-guidebook. 

# V 

- manifesto feels like an abstract of the guidebook. here's the core research questions in the abstract, then links to the parts in the guidebook. which dives in more specifically. in terms of framing and situating. don't need volumes of history, do say here's a research problem this makes me think of, this part of gb addresses and here's a project with it. don't need an uber chapter. do break it into what questions interest you about that intersection. 
- grounding. you can do a grounding all forward looking. can do a question, moving in this direction. don't have to show you the counter. here's what this new world looks like, rich material. don't have to go backwards into past arg about what is real or isn't. here's the question and how we're navigating it.
- who is the we is a great place to start. and why that we. when you say i and we and why it matters and when it matters and proceed that way, without a history of id

E: we collapse into our projects and our

V: 2-3 ppl you want to be in convo w that are writing about this. to put yourself in that conversation. burden not all on you to generate all of it. not all on you to explain every detail. 

E: manifesto as first intro part, gb is more methodology. after that either take each setp separately or expand and put every case there. (write about track changes)

V: what are the questions for you. us: who is writing htis, what is this process? you're taking about process, what IS the process. who is writing and why. these are questions you can use as jumping off points, bring in people you can use as that next step. it just depends what those questions are. it has to be YOUR questoins you want to make sure are addressed in this. 

E: complete diff chapter feminist portals. my politics is asking this to be included. the way i feel the project finished. even if they aren't completely aligned. they were made in tandem not same questions but wanted them to be part of discussion. if it's adding to the things you want to think about. 

V: what is it you really care about gives it that shape. they'll say what do you mean by X, that isn't the project. it's what YOU CARE ABOUT. i'm not sure why i care but i know i do so it's in here until i figure it out. 
V: Something about q of process, a non oppressive process look like in art based tech. What would it mean to create in this enviornent today in a world that is more inclusive and what's the implications what happens when i do that. POV Qs circling back, 
V: if writing from diff strategy be explicit if through formal doesn't fit, use a strategy that untangles it or reveals it for us, doesn't have to be explicit, can reveal it. Can go about Who's writing in 10 diff ways

E: The interesting thing and part of the challenge is that questions of how you do things are part of the politics of it. You have some questions in your abstract: *What are the codes we donâ€™t have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things?*

L: Might be a step back What is Care? MN's new book Freedom. Counter voice. explicitly about care in a harsh way. 

S: I see how your other work flows together. Diff pieces not being hierarchic so they could be ordered under diff unbrellas tentacles. I think What are diff ways of including your projects, one I could see is starting w care or IAI, those are interconnected, see diff ways of how you deal with it and your artworks are one way and a community is another way and iai another. Or could see ok we had the collective and we all had our diff projects and here are their and here are mine. 

E: Multiple levels of questions. Acknowledge. Big abstract what is care. how do we define and embody it. Practical. How do we program in ways that ..specific. Flesh out those questions. // Project questions are not necessarily diss questions. Theoretical interest are bigger or separate and the project is trying to do certain things. Each project/segment has its own. 

V: We are our dissertations. Everything you do from now on. Five Qs dont feel like they have to match part to part. Be in conversation. What is it you're finding in those folks interesting and important to you. The things are also circulating in your project and in your guidebook and manifesto. Translations. 

Em: Depersonalize a little for the job market. It's also the work which speaks for itself. Examples of DIY practices older references. Calle, Horn, Hershmann

Notes creative critical code writing workshop 31.03.22

Sarah: this is for potential members of code collective and poeple who want to start their own chapters. Describe who we are. Who is a collective member? You're curious, put ideas together, not afraid to jump in. What's more fun than a manifunsto. Whimsifesto. 

ideal audience? applicable to diff communities. comforting tone. shared space tensions come up, isn't antyhing like this to use as a resource ang dget on same page. tone is nice and footnotes to jump to, wondering if sharing with just cohort here or undergrads teaching or larger community. who is reading. 

tone, comforting, feels placing intention on inviting audience to not feel gatekeeping effect of coding, works well. having the dot. as a location to go to the breaking of tradition of htm or end part of a url that is there is a nice interruption 

who is the audience question for not just who is reading wondering about invitaiton to be part of the community, in that wondering who is invited who is the community for

who is book for, who is community for

coding care a design philosophy or a space and philosophy

what are the structures of care that are being explored, listed in values section. show earlier, statutes of care being looked at or remedied in community. flip side what are the non care considerations of coding.  

the theme, where bring self in. where it could be earlier, to get more insight into who i am as a coder and writer. segue into problems i'm responding to, create remedy. 

Laney: had to google API. shouldn't feel left out

drawn to fragmented nature of section one. but it kind of is magic a little bit. the playfulness and democratic feel. has invitation. can enjoy it is magic but the rest of the magic is i'll pull in and teach you about it. will that fragmented magical whimsical section continue, it's in snacks and playlist and silly photo. later it becomes a manifesto. which whole thing is a bit. continue playful tone gives you something to hold onto (thread), manifesto thread of how we should treat one another. 

weaving in and out of whimsy and manifesto tones, sense of difference (vs whimsifesto blend)

quotes also feel democratic. any time you reference the others is a point of engagement. 

H: three diff temporalities. report is this is what we've done. present. we continue to. manifesto is future. I want to continue to do, offering to others to adopt. we want it to be and should be this way. awareness of. diss is reports on a project. instructions for a future. we did and now we do.

hear more about the we, as a way of structuring or awareness of temporalities. community is present but maybe examples. more practical level of quotations. 

Faye: notes section feels like a blog, love it. even if they're not going to make it in a finished document, simple novel idea. seeing idea progression. what i'm thinking in a casual way. 

KY is tentatively joining the group and the guidebook is for people interested in joining the future, like her at the beginning.
the tone represents the environment perfectly, warm and inviting. creative spaces can be tense and coding can be gatekeepy, combing can be weird. good job to make sure they don't feel uninvitng.  

as a literary device, using we vs i can do. to think about those polarities moving around the space of a manifesto. wonder in addition to manifesto what words could be used to describe that space, getting sense of electro acoustic spa. manifesto feels restrained, text was breaking past that framework of association. text feels very present, currently happening shifting and changing. manifesto feels declarative proclamation space. fixed. historical commentation. 

any other collective identities i gather writing inspiration from, how other groups talk as a collective I? **what could be done by swapping we for I and vice versa and how it alters the reading experience as outsider.** 

H: moments where it really lifts off, magical poetic lyric element. like "making is always a research question 
"persistence is a rhythm not a slog. 
"refuse to be outsiders in the systems that ignore us.

so much richer and maybe care is a part of that and it's my voice and create a space of care and to write about what that is, my voice to come forward. 

maybe if i write the others in my i will get more comfy. 

bringing back the body, digestion and processing. the snacks are how we get back in our bodies and are reminders that we are all humans.

31.03 CCC

Dazhi: terms of service always shown to you before but do ppl actually read

Julia: consciousness of why we use it and what for, not seeing it yet

D: bc it's record tracking and everything is contained within the system that's really good for currency, but even as a currency it still sucks, so then what can we do if it sucks at its best potential use case. 

J: private companies creating their own private data feeding. very few companies storing their all their info on the blockchain. not one size fits all, is bc a good fit for that. 

D: nft grifters perspective. why the nfts are succeeding, what they do to feed the sentiment nfts are amazing. the marketing strategy is you'll be eligible to get more. getting a subscription to money but what is the value of the thing? the value of the nft is you can ...free airdropped nfts ... potential. amazing pyramid scheme. the purpose of the tokens is to get more tokens, not actually means anything. 

J: I didn't buy in that early. what defines value. going to money in general what does money represent. who secures value and how does it fluctuate. 




---- **so many different outcomes for what you decide to do with a technical challenge you want to give to yourself. sell it commercially or create an expressive art work as the outcome**

phone as your wingman. based on your own conversations it helps you. new app that you have to converse first. 

have actual code in the book? student projects on a page on our site? 
small tools slash art projects that are code based and about the idea of code collective (ky) motto generator. spit out a new motto at each meeting. 

these are things that spark our creativity not big huge projects we embarked on. the smallness of the scale is the benefit. 

refreshing to not code. the pressure builds and people drop out. always teaching or just coding together. you get that in class. 

"Can I go on a tangent?" "Always"

fails running programming clubs in HS. no one responding, over-structured. 

or it worked, friends already, excited, small scale, supportive teacher. 


the way that someone just talking about a project they did turns into a little demo, tutorial.

how you would code something differently now looking back at an existing project you made a year or more ago.
