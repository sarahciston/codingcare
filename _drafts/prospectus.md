## abstract

What are the codes we don't have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? 

What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things? 


The _Anarchist’s Tool Chest_ says there is power in a small set of tools, known intimately and carried easily. Its author Christopher Schwarz calls this "a radical and rare idea that can help change the world." This idea is missing from AI tools, which require massive technical knowhow and financial resources to operate.

The work done with Intersectional AI Toolkit and Creative Code Collective both argues that anyone should be able to understand the key tools of technology and should have the power to reimagine the systems that impact them most.

### concepts
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts
* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **trans\***: inclusive, fluid, nonbinary, change-focused, self-identifying, embodied & emergent, evolving. the asterisk searches for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable.  
* **formative**: fundamental, foundational experiences. what shapes us
* **trans*formative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices
* **processing**: another word for programming, processing focuses not on the end product or task but the inter/intra action, the digestion that happens. of code. of trauma. of information. 
* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered
* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied, tinkering

Therefore **Coding Care** is XXXX

And **Trans*formative processing** inspired in part by histories of transformative justice, recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems, and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it and to imagining and creating different, even healing systems. While reparative and restorative also have resonance with this project, the terms' relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Meanwhile a broader sense of transformation and the added layers of resonance with trans\*-inclusive approaches to gender, sexuality, identity, and imaginative futures seems more befitting of this project, its participants, and its intentions. The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

And **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne.

(Spideralex)

   >>from an Introduction to Technological Sovereignty by [Margarita Padilla(https://sobtec.gitbooks.io/sobtec2/content/en/content/01preface.html)]:
   >>"So as with all other sovereignty, technological sovereignty is made in communities. Communities exist and they are everywhere. unceasingly creating and recreating themselves, shared flats, neighborhoods, friends, workmates, professional networks, extended families, communities are everywhere. As with any symbolic construction communities are not something you can see with your eyes. They are something you see with your mind and feel the bonds with your heart. For those of us fighting for technological sovereignty, communities are a tangible reality. They're there. We see them and we feel them and though technologies theories are, typically related to consumer, luxury goods and insulated individualism. This is only the vision presented by the industry and the market, a market that seeks to isolate and be Wilder consumer, all technologies developed in community, these communities can be more or less autonomous or more or less controlled by cooperation, the struggle for sovereignty is about these communities, nobody invents, builds, or codes alone, quite simply because the task is such that it would be impossible."

   >"any infrastructure you need to set up from scratch, it's slow, and then it becomes like, it goes faster, it accelerates at one stage, I don't know why, I guess that you need to build the structure, the infrastructure that is going to be sustaining everything. And when you are figuring how to build it, or what is the better ways when things are slower. [...] And when you build a project that is based on informal and volunteer work, to maintain an infrastructure, things are gonna be slow, because yeah, we are all feminists. So we are very busy. We are struggling in different fights that are sometimes death and life important. And of course, like being able to learn to administrate services or host contents, maybe is not always the first thing in our list."

   >"Of course, all the feminist hack labs, fab labs, bio labs, feminist radios, servers, and artificial intelligence, internet bots and protocols that are developed or think or theorize from a feminist perspective. All the work around restorative justice process, feminist science fiction and futurotopia's, building feminist libraries and fanzines, developing documentation and memory tools. Contributing to the herstory, producing and maintaining self defense resource about digital, connected space but also physical security. Permacultural gardens. Other gardens. Lands. Spells. Rituals. These tools, techniques for lives, land defending, all these are important and is part of the feminist infrastructure we are interested in."

## Chapter: Guidebook

### Creative Code Collective: A How-To Guide for Programming As a Caring Community Practice

Learning programming is often intimidating and riddled with false starts, which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. This guidebook offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. The guide takes as its case study Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in 2019 for emerging media artists, writers, and non-engineers to think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Designed for students from all backgrounds, especially those who have not had the opportunity to code before, the Collective is an intersectional intervention responding to the need for supportive spaces that value students’ diverse capacities to learn. It draws on approaches like Nick Montfort’s "programming as inquiry" and Rachel Simanjuntak’s "care as artistic practice." The Collective also aligns its viewpoint with Geoff Cox and Winnie Soon's _Aesthetic Programming_, which purposefully teaches creative code situated within critical and political stakes, and which also embodies that politics by inviting others to fork the book. 

The Collective takes creative-critical code pedagogy as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition." It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now three-year-old community, including how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methodology from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work in electronic literature, tactical media, and natural language processing. Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice. This allows me to model for students my vulnerability as an artist-researcher, which reciprocally becomes the best teaching tool of all. 

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an ethics of coding care—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: “We all have something to teach each other.” Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly “anyone can join.” Rather, it reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.

“the reduction from context to data, from meaning to statistical pattern recognition” [24, p. 100]
“Sidelining issues of ethics is harmful in itself, and it perpetuates the false idea that scientific research happens in a vacuum, with no responsibility for the ideas it propagates.” [117]
>> Where will this data go next? How can you protect its knowledge value? “The practices of data extraction and training dataset construction are premised on a commercialized capture of what was previously part of the commons. This particular form of erosion is a privatization by stealth, an extraction of knowledge value from public goods. A dataset may still be publicly available, but the metavalue of the data—the model created by it—is privately held.” [120]
“Classification is an act of power, [...] but classifications can disappear ‘into infrastructure, into habit, into the taken for granted’[...]. (Bowker and Star)[128] We can easily forget that the classifications that are casually chosen to shape a technical system can play a dynamic role in shaping the social and material world.”
“The tendency to focus on the issue of bias in artificial intelligence has drawn us away from assessing the core practices of classification in AI, along with their attendant politics.” [128]
“artificial intelligence uses classification to encode power” 
“mathematical parity is frequently proposed to produce ‘fairer systems’ instead of contending with underlying social, political, and economic structures”
“classificatory infrastructures contain gaps and contradictions: they necessarily reduce complexity, and they remove significant context, in order to make the world more computable. But they also proliferate in machine learning platforms in what Umberto Eco called “chaotic enumeration.”71 At a certain level of granularity, like and unlike things become sufficiently commensurate so that their similarities and differences are machine readable, yet in actuality their characteristics are uncontainable. Here, the issues go far beyond whether something is classified wrong or classified right. We are seeing strange, unpredictable twists as machine categories and people interact and change each other,”[148] 

“Machine learning systems are, in a very real way, constructing race and gender: they are defining the world within the terms they have set, and this has long-lasting ramifications for the people who are classified.” [146]
>>“the act of defining categories and ideas of normalcy creates an outside: forms of abnormality, difference, and otherness. [...] That restricts the range of how people are understood and can represent themselves, and it narrows the horizon of recognizable identities. [147]
“machine learning systems are seeking to classify entirely relational things into fixed categories and are rightly critiqued as scientifically and ethically problematic.” [146]
“It is much rarer to have a public debate about why these forms of bias and discrimination frequently recur and whether more fundamental problems are at work than simply an inadequate underlying dataset or a poorly designed algorithm.” [129]
Because they draw on past data, the systems are inadvertently diagnostic, rather than predictive as they claim: “The employment practices of the past and present were shaping the hiring tools for the future. Amazon’s system unexpectedly revealed the ways bias already existed, from the way masculinity is encoded in language, in résumés, and in the company itself.” [130]
“The AI industry has traditionally understood the problem of bias as though it is a bug to be fixed rather than a feature of classification itself. The result has been a focus on adjusting technical systems to produce greater quantitative parity across disparate groups,”[130]
“how patterns of inequality across history shape access to resources and opportunities, which in turn shape data. That data is then extracted for use in technical systems for classification and pattern recognition, which produces results that are perceived to be somehow objective” [131]”The result is a statistical ouroboros: a self-reinforcing discrimination machine that amplifies social inequalities under the guise of technical neutrality.”
“Though well intentioned, the classifications they used reveal the politics of what diversity meant in this context. For example, to label the gender and age of a face, the team tasked crowdworkers to make subjective annotations, using the restrictive model of binary gender.”[132]
“‘Fairness’ was reduced to meaning higher accuracy rates for machine-led facial recognition, and ‘diversity’ referred to a wider range of faces to train the model. Craniometric analysis functions like a bait and switch, ultimately depoliticizing the idea of diversity and replacing it with a focus on variation.” [132]
“Skin color detection is done because it can be, not because it says anything about race or produces a deeper cultural understanding. Similarly, the use of cranial measurement is done because it is a method that can be done with machine learning. [...The capacity to deploy] digital epidermalization at scale drives a desire to find meaning in these approaches, even if this method has nothing to do with culture, heritage, or diversity. They are used to increase a problematic understanding of accuracy. Technical claims about accuracy and performance are commonly shot through with political choices about categories and norms but are rarely acknowledged as such. These approaches are grounded in an ideological premise of biology as destiny, where our faces become our fate.” [133]
“fails to address the deeper harm of allocating people into gender or race categories without their input or consent. [...] The work of essentializing and ordering on the basis of biology or culture has long been used to justify forms of violence and oppression.” [139]
“highly influential infrastructures and training datasets pass as purely technical, whereas in fact they contain political interventions within their taxonomies: they naturalize a particular ordering of the world which produces effects that are seen to justify their original ordering.” [139]
“To present these as logical categories of organizing people is already troubling, even before they are used to classify people based on their appearance” [140]
“In fact, there are no neutral categories in ImageNet, because the selection of images always interacts with the meaning of words. The politics are baked into the classificatory logic, even when the words aren’t offensive. ImageNet is a lesson, in this sense, of what happens when people are categorized like objects.” [142]
“The focus on making training sets ‘fairer’ by deleting offensive terms fails to contend with the power dynamics of classification and precludes a more thorough assessment of the underlying logics. Even if the worst examples are fixed, the approach is still fundamentally built on an extractive relationship with data that is divorced from the people and places from whence it came. Then it is rendered through a technical worldview that seeks to fuse together a form of singular objectivity from what are complex and varied cultural materials.”[143]




>>”As Anna Lauren Hoffman writes: “The problem here isn’t only one of biased datasets or unfair algorithms and of unintended consequences. It’s also indicative of a more persistent problem of researchers actively reproducing ideas that damage vulnerable communities and reinforce current injustices. Even if the Harvard team’s proposed system for identifying gang violence is never implemented, hasn’t a kind of damage already been done? Wasn’t their project an act of cultural violence in itself?”

Anna Lauren Hoffman says, “the idea of discursive violence can help us destabilize any neat or firm distinction between “good” and “bad” applications of data science and technology as binaries that are, themselves, indicative of broader social and ideological commitments” [11]
The data-driven impulse to include more data, 
“Discussion of all these cases quickly veers toward fairness, accountability, and transparency. A kind of forensic instinct kicks in: How, technically, did this happen? How, technically, can we prevent it from happening again?”[12]
“it tends to focus on individual “bad actors” that act in discriminatory ways while failing to account for the structural conditions that maintain inequalities. The law is also only equipped to handle discriminatory acts after they’ve occurred”
“consequences of our work, but also our assumptions, our categories, and our position relative to the subjects of the data we work with”
“our discussions need to be grounded in the political and cultural contexts that make these people vulnerable or marginalized in the first place”[12]
“It is important to ask who might be damaged by a certain set of assumptions and a certain algorithmic solution. We should also ask: Who does this protect? Who cannot be a target of this set of data? I am shielding someone — what does that say about my system?”

Library scholar Hope A. Olson points out that classification problems are not new to the machine learning field; rather, the problematic goal of a universal standardized codified through library cataloging practices  as “the notational representation of topics” has been developed and codified through library catalog practices since at least the nineteenth century. 
Olson terms “naming information”  for “the creation of document representations. In this process, terms or notations assigned to reflect the document's subject are organized into a database”[13]
“Yet in imposing controlled vocabulary we construct both a limited system for the representation of information and a universality/diversity binary opposition. Our systems seem transparent in Henri Lefvebre's use of the term (1991, 28)——they appear unbiased and universally applicable——but they actually hide their exclusions under the guise of neutrality. Not surprisingly, this fundamental presumption on which our practice rests disproportionately affects access to information outside of the cultural mainstream and about groups marginalized in our society“
Just as a machine learning model can only relate to the forms of information that fit information shaped to be computable, in a library catalog organized by decimal notation, says Olson, “the external organizing force [the notation system], rather than the contents [such as world languages], determines the correct shape. The ten pre-determined pigeonholes are ‘ideal compartments’ for classification. Dewey's focus is on the compartments, not on their content.” [13]
