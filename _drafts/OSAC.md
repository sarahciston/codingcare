* CREATIVE CODE COLLECTIVE
* What do your own communities of practice around coding look like? 
* What’s your experience with coding communities, what makes them work or not work for you? What do you find most valuable, What’s frustrating? 
* What is missing in our coding communities that you would you like to see? 
* What questions do you have about how to create them? 
* What's that ineffable magic in that thing we do together?


* NO KNOTS ONLY LOOPS 
& CRITICAL FIELD GUIDE 
& LOVE CORPORA 
* How can we create tangible, accessible, non-traditional entrypoints for, metaphors for, alternative approaches to ML, for new goals & different communities. e.g. Crochet, diff datasets, diff models and architectures.
* How to make friendly introductions to ML that don't skip the technical/critical/ethical essentials? Critical Field Guide to Working with Machine Learning Datasets, Intersectional AI Toolkit
* What are the datasets that undergird large language models made of, what gaps do they have about queer life about anyone othered? What do language models say about people like me? Can they speak so that I recognize myself? WIP: Love Corpora


INTERSECTIONAL AI TOOLKIT ZINES & PLATFORM
* What do makers, activists, et al practically need/want to know about ML in order to make interventions?
* What formats reshape how we can share information and connect w each other? zines, workshops, less hierarchical, this unconference
* How not to be lonely on an open-source project? Enough structure to show people where it could be fun to contribute but not so much they feel unqualified, don't know what's happening or what they can offer

<!-- access & data sovreignty activity: grounding questions,  
-what does access mean to you? 
-why is accessibility important? to have equitable, a range of responses, influences, balanced systems. 
-what stake do you have in accessibility? my own limitations, my past and future limitations, my power and disempowered places, my stake is what i can help facilitate just as much as what i need support with. as well as who has access to me.
-what are you doing to promote accessibility? keeping open vulnerable channels, not assuming one way to do things, sharing material/information resources

<!-- bobby joe, consent practices in an open source context, when you're working in a community not everyone has the same political lens w similar goals. font licensing agreement. free here but pay for other use. open source so that things can be a discussion, conflict and change can happen. gap in the transfer of knowledge between elders and youth. people leaving is a design challenge. certain info people are stewards of the knowledge. cant just put it on a website! doesn't have to be the end but can be creative.

<!-- Casey: these are made by people, can know this and it frames the interactions -->
<!-- Roopa: an ecosystem of paying it forward, giving back. thinking about how we show this in the examples themselves. if you use it pay it forward. -->
