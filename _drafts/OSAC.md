* CREATIVE CODE COLLECTIVE
* What do your communities of practice around coding look like? 
* What do you find valuable, What’s frustrating? 
* What’s your experience with coding communities, what makes them work or not work for you?
* what is missing in them that you would you like to see? 
* What questions do you have about how to create them? 
* What's that ineffable magic in that thing we do together?

* ML DATASETS / NO KNOTS ONLY LOOPS
* Is it possible to create tangible, accessible, non-traditional entrypoints for, metaphors for, alternative approaches to ML, for new goals & different communities. e.g. Crochet, diff datasets, diff models and architectures.
* How to make friendly introductions to ML that don't skip the technical/critical/ethical essentials? IAITK, Critical Field Guide to Working with Machine Learning Datasets
* What are the datasets that undergird large language models made of, what gaps do they have about queer life about anyone othered? Love Corpora... WIP

INTERSECTIONAL AI TOOLKIT
* What do makers, activists, et al practically need/want to know about ML in order to make interventions?
* What formats reshape how we can share information and connect w each other? zines, workshops, less hierarchical
* How not to be lonely on an open-source project? Enough structure to show people where it could be fun to contribute but not so much they feel unqualified, don't know what's happening or what they can offer

<!-- access & data sovreignty activity: grounding questions,  
-what does access mean to you? 
-why is accessibility important? to have equitable, a range of responses, influences, balanced systems. 
-what stake do you have in accessibility? my own limitations, my past and future limitations, my power and disempowered places, my stake is what i can help facilitate just as much as what i need support with. as well as who has access to me.
-what are you doing to promote accessibility? keeping open vulnerable channels, not assuming one way to do things, sharing material/information resources
