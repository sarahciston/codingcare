# What Now / What's After

## Splines, Similarity, and Nearness Vectors

The \* emphasizes an unspoken interstitial — interjection, interruption, insertion, interpolation — this work happening in between and nearby, underneath and overhead and throughout. In digital contexts this may be called [`lerp`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp) (short for 'linear interpolation' and much more fun to say) or [`tween`](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-frame-animations.html) or [`spline`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds&ab) [^spline] or smoothing. These methods of interpolation are methods of creating or locating nearness and of smoothing the rough journey between. To `interpolate` in math is to create new knowledge (datapoints) based on existing knowledge (datapoints), or to estimate value at a position based on values from nearby positions. 

But I always mix up the terms `interpolate` and `interpellate`. To `interpellate` is to interrupt or intercede (again like interstitial) or to summon, cite, call out. Shall I interpolate the distance between `interpolate` and `interpellate`? Political philosopher Frantz Fanon describes being called out as a racialized body and witnessing himself as another person's brutal interpretation [@fanonBlackSkinWhite1967]. Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser describes being hailed by a representative of the State apparatus and understanding it is himself who is meant [@althusserIdeologyIdeologicalState1970]. Both these interpellations are about being seen, about the necessity of submitting to this seeing, about shame. These interpellations are also crossing a distance, creating a nearness, pulling close under duress. This distance is a street or sidewalk, and it is also the conceptual distance between how someone else understands us and how we wish to be known. 

[^spline]: Splines were originally the physical, flexible materials used to create curves between points, used for calculations involved in arches, domes, and ship building. The principle relies on the resistance in materials, on the energy required to bend. 

Interpolation divides up distance, quantifies it, makes it possible to cross (it leaps Zeno's paradox with stepping stones). Interpolation makes interpellation possible in computational regimes, because it helps map (define) an individual, through generalization. It pins one down to classificatory schemas (created from collections of other interpellated individuals). [These are weak-star topologies.] Computationally, proximity helps us jump to conclusions about each other: 

>"a reliable link between the addressor and the addressee is the precondition of not only computing but also [...] of modern disciplinary states and their sociotechnicalities, and addressability emerges as a key shared operational logic." [@dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022]

>"[The algorithm] presents something as a singular optimal output, when it is actually generated through multiple and contingent relations. [...] I understand the spatial logic of algorithms to be an arrangement of propositions that significantly generates what matters in the world." [@amooreCloudEthicsAlgorithms2020]

>"Data, in this sense, are more than operative forms of value; they establish the values of difference as the subject and object of organization."[@amaroBlackTechnicalObject2022]

All this reduces to nearness and distance. how similarity and difference are mapped onto nearness and distance. What if the polarities were reversed — nearness and difference, similarity and distance? What if different values took priority instead of only matching like with like? How about all other intuitions that bring us together, including but not only what make us the same? What activation functions might activate other intuitions, or tamper with expectations, beyond or between the X and Y axes?

How many kinds of measurements of distance are there? How many dimensions and ways to fold them?

[We have created so many algorithms for pathfinding. We use these constantly to optimize our ways across spaces and even to optimize our relations to each other. We've created everything about space and time, and how to make more and less of it.] What if — instead of using proximity as a shortcut to sameness — we looked to "radical otherness as the driver of adaptability" [@bridleWaysBeingHuman2022]. What if we found other models and values to guide what questions we ask and what [things] we compare, what [relations] we highlight and [what futures we shape]? 

## Nearbyness

>"not to speak about but rather to speak nearby" [@chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992]

I want to write a theory of nearbyness (near-bi-ness) that is not a theory of nearness. Not nearness as measures and scores, not proximity and similarity, not K-means and K-nearest-neighbors. Filmmaker Trinh T. Minh Ha describes 'speaking nearby' as "a speaking that does not objectify, does not point to an object as if it is distant from the speaking subject or absent from the speaking place. A speaking that reflects on itself and can come very close to a subject without, however, seizing or claiming it" [@chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992]. This is `nearbyness` as a practice of attending-to, not `nearness` as the foundation for assumption-making. Through what it places in conversation, in contact, in texture, in tension, nearbyness enacts via poetic logics and "forms of indirectness" that, and how, and why its elements require each other. Nearbyness prefigures the more-than which this closeness creates. This is a trans\*disciplinary practice, as more than the sum of its combined fields or niches, and it is a trans\*formative practice too. <!-- abolition -->

I want to take up Trinh's argument — that the nearby "is an attitude in life, a way of positioning oneself in relation to the world. Thus, the challenge is to materialize it" [@chenSpeakingNearbyConversation1992] — in order to suggest that this nearbyness can respond to computational values of compartmentalizing, modularity, and encapsulation, which silo off data from the code that operates on it. 

These values separate disciplinary discourses from politics and from each other. They separate for efficiency and understanding, security and containment. As [XXX-ID] Tara McPherson says, computation's modular values emerged simultaneously with and in response to the civil rights movement in the US: "the very structures of digital computation correspond to larger cultural shifts that seek to cordon off race and to contain it" [-@mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018]. McPherson's metaphor of "lenticular" postcards, which show two separate images when viewed from different angles, demonstrate how modularity allows for invisibility, despite proximity. She argues that lenticular perspectives position "our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference while forestalling connection and interrelation. [...] A lenticular logic is a logic of the fragment or the chunk, a way of seeing the world as discrete modules or levels, a mode that suppresses relation and context." From object-oriented programming to object-oriented ontology, from global supply chains to machine learning architectures, such projects deny their entanglements. They reduce these entanglements to magnitudes of distance in vector dimensions. 

Even "meaning" in language has become increasingly defined by these numerical representations of proximity. Through natural language processing, nearness becomes co-occurance becomes word vector becomes fact and prediction. The [modus operandi/battle cry] of predictive language systems, underlying tools like AdSense and GhatGPT, is a 1957 quip from linguist JR Firth: "the meaning of a word can be inferred by the company it keeps" [@firthApplicationsGeneralLinguistics1957]. 

`Nearbyness` resists this denial of complex entanglements by reuniting them in conversation, bringing close without collapsing distinctions. It is a different way of placing side by side, making note of more than frequency and sameness, with the aim to replace knowing-as-conquering with other kinds of understanding: frisson, spark, and activation; disparity, tension, and curiosity; cooperation and commitment, for example. [XXX-ID] Romi Morrison's work on flesh and unknowability describes alternative ways of knowing:

>"leaving open the unresolved space of coming to know something that is relational: taking into consideration the specific context of the speaker, the place from which they speak, the closeness they share, and the mode through which that speaking happens. To know in this context is not a territorial claim to be made, enclosed, and defended but an endured practice of proximity. To speak nearby is a gesture of knowing that requires engagement, perforating the hermetic encapsulation of totality." [@morrisonFlesh2021]

Critical theorist Lauren Berlant also details how such relations can maintain closeness, without capitulating to machine learning's reductionism, through the same "non-sovereign" knowing Trihn describes: 

>"The space between and the spaces among involve distances created by the disturbance of being close without being joined, and without mistaking the other's flesh for one's own or any object world as identical to oneself. Nonsovereignty is not here the dissolution of a boundary. It's the experience of affect, of being receptive, in real time." [@berlantCommonsInfrastructuresTroubling2016]

These operations of nearbyness [bring us to form and formative]. The assembling logic here is of accretion and coalition – an *Arcades Project* of wandering, filing, putting like with like, but also unlike and other aspects together, or at least nearby. It is a machine learning task, an `un-machine un-learning` task, to decide how information goes together or does not, to find patterns in a system. It is also a very human activity. [This project enacts the process through intuitive and counter-intuitive feeling [@camptListeningImages2017][weirdpivothere?].] For some, like Vilém Flusser,[^Flusser] writing is a sculptor's cutting away. For others, like Walter Benjamin, writing is a collector's fever dream. I believe it is both, collecting fragments when you cannot yet see a form, when you cannot do anything else; then cutting away at them until what has already formed becomes clearer. Anuradha Reddy describes the process of working with varied materials similarly as a process of "adjacency":

<!-- accumulation and cutting away, pattern finding in collections of data, as the reverse proxies for making and testing theories, contraposed knowledge generating systems [Joque, Revolutionary Mathematics] -->

[^Flusser]: "[Writing] has nothing to do with constructing. It is, on the contrary, a taking away, a de-structing. It is, both structurally and historically, closer to sculpture than to architecture. It is a gesture of making holes, of digging, of perforating. A penetrating gesture. To write is to in-scribe, to penetrate a surface," [CITE]

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one's expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices." [@reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022]

This ability to work with machine learning, or any technology, as a concrete material — as an artist or craftsperson would — is a way of moving into curiosity, poetics, aesthetics: nearbyness. 

## Computing New Computations

From the works in this collection, I have begun to get an inkling of a 'compu-poetics' of Nearbyness. What would nearbyness ask of trans\*formative systems in order to change technologies — for example, to move from foundation models that have been built on narrow slices of data and classificatory logics, to transformative models that might unravel them? What does Nearbyness and *Coding.Care* ask of me? 

At least, at first, to ask better questions, to get my hands dirty, to get closer. Transformation pulls us up from the roots. What does trans\*formative computing look like? Probably many things, with many different goals, created specifically by the communities who will use it. For example, based on knowledge and intelligence that is "not classificatory but storied," not totalizing but exploratory [@ingoldLifeLines2015], can we imagine a phenomenological model of language, instead of a stochastic one [@benderDangersStochasticParrots2021]? What does it look like to code nearby, to code relationally?

I hope this sounds less far-fetched than before. We know that computation did not start out binary and does not have to stay that way. Voltage begins as an analogue signal. Nature's nonclassificatory logics offer many other forms of calculation: Soap film computers [@SoapFilmAnalogue2017], mushroom computers [@maddukuriWhatIfWe2021], slime moulds and liquid state machines [@bridleWaysBeingHuman2022] all produce complex, non-binary operations. Artist Stephanie Dinkins says, "Widely deployed AI can support bottom-up decision making and provide the public means to directly inform the systems that govern us while also empowering the governed" [@koernerSoftwareArtistsBook2020]. By rethinking AI and all emergent technologies as craft/able — available for our intervention and imagination — we have the opportunity to reconfigure and transform our relationships to these technologies and each other. 

>"Part of the construction of dominator privilege is you don't have to think about what are those other people thinking, feeling, hoping, dreaming. I think part of transformation is when you open yourself to wanting to know what those people who are not like you are doing, thinking, being." [@hooksbellWhyFamedFeminist2018] 

## What's After?

What it calls for in the future...

**To move from foundation models, which have been built on narrow data and stereotyped classificatory logics, to transformative models which might unravel them...**

Because generative AI models have become so large, and training processes so slow and expensive, they frequently rely on foundation models — previous models, often designed for other tasks, used as the building block or sourdough starter for new models. Foundation models

I think part of transformation is when you open yourself to wanting to know what those people who are not like you are doing, thinking, being." [@hooksbellWhyFamedFeminist2018] 

Soap bubble computers, mushroom computers, non-binary voltage readings. What are the nonclassificatory logics that might run other forms of calculation?  [Bridle's call here & how this meets it] What does a phenomenological model of language instead of a stochastic model of language look like? 

Artist James Bridle suggests that more ecological machines must be "non-binary, decentralized, and unknowing" [@bridleWaysBeingHuman2022] – pointing to where this already occurs in the more-than-human world in which we are immersed, including slime moulds and liquid state machines as examples of analogue computers making complex, non-binary operations.

>>"knowledge is not classificatory but storied, not totalising and synoptic but open-ended and exploratory." (Ingold 2015, 48)
>"Less a surveyor than a narrator, his aim is not – as Kant would have it – to ‘classify and arrange’, or ‘to place every experience in its class’, but rather to situate each impression in relation to the occurrences that paved the way for it, presently concur with it, and follow along after. In this sense his knowledge is not classiﬁcatory but storied, not totalising and synoptic but open-ended and exploratory."

From these works, I am developing some sketches towards [a compu-poetics of] `nearbyness`:

<!-- Refusing how technologies have been posited as serving capitalist goals can mean reorienting toward technologies of sharing. 
~~No to capital and Yes to sharing~~ -->

TechNO is also open-access, open-source — in their refusal to capitulate to capitalist regimes of encapsulation, privatization, knowledge-hoarding and gatekeeping. 

<!-- in IAIT? -->
Open-source projects are often open in name only. OpenAI is the most prominent example of this, as a company that began creating machine learning models that offered research access but has increasingly become closed and proprietary. Elsewhere, I have written about the gaps in open-source works which do nothing more than place a single version of their source code online — in contrast to robust, responsive open-source projects that develop their work over multiple versions in consultation with their communities. Elea Zhong argues that not only do large corporate entities claiming to be open source often fail to offer substantive contributions to open-source communities, they misuse the term 'open source' to extort free labor. 

>"In the same way big oil brands itself with greenwashing for illusory environmental progressiveness, big tech extol their open source efforts to open-wash their capitalist, monopolistic, and destructive reality. Technological development is in dire need for a policy-first, documentation-first, ideology-first methodology, and AI must transform its focus on creating systems which understands and addresses the complexity of its environment, critically assesses its context, and produces meaning-rich results." (Elea Zhong 2023)

Machine unlearning ([ender 2023](https://www.enderverse.org/notes/unlearning.html)) points out that 
The new task in machine learning called 'machine unlearning' has emerged due to large models' training costs and the practice of indiscrimine data scraping. As Code Collective member ender writes, machine unlearning assumes access to the models it wants to alter, which also assumes a powerful role with agency in big tech. Instead, ender combines questions of machine unlearning with adversarial data poisoning to ask how one can remove data from a model without access to the initial model.
