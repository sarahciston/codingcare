toward end more sprawling direction
rounding out finding point where first section reaches a closure and go to the new thing
lists that invite evidence or narrative elements, openings for evidence. find the points where evidence could support more (magenta)

SELWA
evidence may be happening off the page already?
fully trust the arguments who i'm referencing who talking about. center more of my work, with examples or work i'm sharing. 

— Who do you want your work to be legible to? (Who do you want it to ignite / excite?)

— What stake or claim are you most excited about? Least sure about?

— Why are you most interested in having us focus on 2.1 Trans*formative? 

— How are these first sections (1&2) supporting the rest of the dissertation

— If you had to make one stake / question / claim per dissertation section what would those be?
- who do you want to excite or ignite
- 
clarity of what's at stake, claiming. creating a special space for people to get excited about.

part one here we are, part two we're gonna dance really fast, 
what about the transformative, is it really cultivating special, in the other sections. 

someone's into this, they're in my person

most curious about structure. thought it was super clear. q of evidence/examples or structure. greta job of mapping out the terms. a what was wrong, b what was needed, c here's the categories in which we relly need to rethink this architecture. 

hard for people to wrap their heads around praxis, public, working with, prefiguration. go tto the heart of it by mapping out the categories. what's coming before and after. 

how do we make these things and how do we make with. second part essential to understanding the project. 

if you're trying to publish as book form, do you want to protect that now. there are models for xenofeminism, the book and site.

LUKE: how i might imagine it traveling, taking on new forms. forking a dissertation is radical. walk peple through ihow it might happen. sections explicitly designed to travel. designed to be taken up and reused (CC book). the context behind it could travel as a license that explains why and how. an appendix that explians the afterlife of the text. 

talks and workshops, publishers that would have that travel? art book or museum catalog, where it would be a part of it. an art book partner w a community space.

<!-- ### reading comments -->

- add details of my data art practice (or not), more technical to balance OK's
- add details of OK's epistolary relations, more personal to balance my personal
- add technical description of telegram, how someone sends, processes. how he made postcards.
- add or connect or remove contemp ref to global issue
- tracking the relations more for us both, triangulations of care redefined through datapoints
- ...as a way of tracking/mapping the image of the dot throughout a representation of care
- OK's performance of reading the numbers 1-1mil: "1000 days 1 million years"
- breath, pulse, blue dot

<!-- footnotes get skipped over. reading aloud works -->

<!-- unfamiliar, uncanny atmosphere, two novels: David M wittgensteins mistress, christine __meyers Landscape. references. role of tech, dead/living/ communication with past. contemp nonfiction taking tone of postapocalypse. lean into  . hearing it from an AI voice 1000 years from now alone on a loop.  -->

<!-- slashes, word choices, tangible references. data and coding, feels tactile. seeing all together pleasurable even if scared of code it's okay.  -->

<!-- a cumulative effect of on kawara. how the text replicates this, effective.  -->

<!-- six sections distinct chapters, all loops together, progression intros us to code, section four is heavy, movement between i and address, beautifully with larger project.  -->

<!-- approach OK with distance of time diff moment with digital devices, his quiotidian dates/postcards/labor in context of auto tracking/collection, mother's experience of me. expand: 1) anecdotes of people kawara wrote to, commercial, vs friend, analog/epistolary; 2) couldn't see my data art practice, describe more detail, put picture in.  -->

<!-- agree see artwork. sincere, close to writing, caught off guard. strong observation of how we approach mental health with machine learning. medicine and AI used together long time. how far patterns go to describe us or categorize us, where to find a balance.  -->

<!-- technical writing, new categorization of nothingness, does increasing categorization of nothingness make it go away or create another type of order, reads funny next to falsy. -->

<!-- putting my art in conversation with OK's in question with aliveness and what data collection has to do with this. pulled in to what could recognize more easily, the relations, tracking the people: mother, friend. wanted to see the art. the task felt like making those connections between writer's art and their relations' potential aliveness or writers' anxiety, question of care and mothering, triangulation of mother's caring through technology and writer's same care for friend through technology. anchors/structure.  -->

<!-- reminded of hugh lemine, hildegard unknown language, bahnu kapil. reforges new definitions of familial intimacy, when we're asked to reevaluate ourselves as data points. want to hear more about figure of/spectre of the drone: if a drone/mother, appears again at end, harbinger of violence, unexpected, different scale of the other violences, curious about it and difficult to reconcile.  -->

<!-- word choices [/] adds personal encoding, add to the personal on OK's side to parallel own experience. most compelling the language we're using with the personal vs computational "unaliving" stronger connections to the change in our own understanding. more? -->

<!-- grounded in presentness, heartbeat, rhythm, didn't need to see artwork in but as companion,  -->

<!-- Lisa: drawn to granular way addressing pro/con allures and scary aspects of crimes/self body. interesting way in. spectrum. the commercial aspect of the art i discuss, my dissertation part of a larger economic system that expects from me. *the personal being so closely tied to economic interests.* time creates something not tied to a moment because of how pitch things tied to me and not tied to me, the violences opens a way to think about time in a way, what's being recorded, not pinpointing but describing.  -->

<!-- Ashley: tactile, images. font. coding. reflected what text is doing moving through time w different types of technologies. pointing to ideas that as tech advances comm becomes easier but less personal. telegraph/postcards a physical thing vs receiving emojis in months. echo but reflect change in effort and personalization, reflects the distance between people. Syntax: blunt and fragmented, contrast w the research integrated. truncated abruptness reflects the postcards. epistolary to write to someone who is dead, addressing the format, as a way to explicitly address the act of living.  -->

<!-- very visual, presentation as reading in a circle. OK 1000 days 1 million years, performance of reading the numbers 1-100000. writing about displacement and mapping as a dot perspective, way to consider care and safety and embodiment and transencoding. postcard/male documentation. care and how you view someone as family. sleeping section, curious to know more, as a way of dreaming, coretical sleeping.  -->

<!-- not needing to see the artwork, pulsing dot visually present throughout. the dates and time connected w personal experience felt like i was mapping something. transform something cold robotic, distant to personal and breathing.  -->

<!-- how someone sends a telegram. the technical stuff. how he made the postcards.  -->

<!-- >"needed a proxy for" "The algorithm’s designers needed a proxy for illness and settled on medical costs. (All things being equal, people who are sicker tend to use more health care.) Obermeyer found, however, that the algorithm dramatically underestimated how sick Black patients were, because the Black patients it examined had much lower health spending than the white patients, even when they were equally sick. Such algorithmic bias can occur not just by race, but by gender, age, rurality, income, and other factors of which we’re only dimly aware, making algorithms less accurate."  -->
