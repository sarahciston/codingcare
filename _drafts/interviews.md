[Even [another member] who was confronted with opportunities to profit immensely off NFTs, but decided not to because of Code Collective, because when she was thinking about these ideas, she could see other people who are also using code in the creative manner.][No one said, 'What you're doing is wrong.' We said, 'Oh, like it sounds like you're having mixed feelings about this. Let's talk about it.' Or she was very vocal, but we were all interested in it and had dynamic conversations around it.]

## Garrett Flynn
"neurodata without borders"
data standard for neurophysiology data
web _ neuro
dont have money and foregrounding ethics
engineers more opinionated than users in some ways
no extractive mechanic
open source, at some level accessible and accountable

if critical warmth happens at all it's after hours
investment in it is low
crash space : culver city. tuesdays. too maker
jsLA language specific. 

strengths of CCC is the high level scope. not tool based communities. not siloed. specific enough to be useful general enough to be interesting. 
about craft not about the specific thing you're amking, creating with code spans all boundaries. don't get a wide conversation. 
the questions don't get asked unless you're looking outside your niche/language. agnostic disc

will anyone use this, questioning what i was doing in a lab, ethical philosophical uestions. 
ccc drop off post pandemic
mentorying knowledge society, 10-15 hs, public projects - educational wouldn't have been the focus without ccc focus/polymathic
visualization, wanting to present work and involving them in tangible experience
showcases about map
help people / show people
not yet feeling creative either, feeling like playing where does it pass into art
documentation! haven't nailed. marging with portfolio
organic not contrived sharing. sharing in progress.

1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.400
Sarah Ciston: AI companion. Everything has. AI. Now, it's really yeah.

2
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.940
Sarah Ciston: Cool. Okay. So we should be going and

3
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.430
Sarah Ciston: awesome.

4
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.800
Sarah Ciston:  yeah. So what are you up to these days just like

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.710
Sarah Ciston: workwise, and you finish your master's.

6
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.439
Garrett Flynn: Yes, I finished. My master's

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:46.080
Garrett Flynn: a year and a half ago at this point, so it's been quite a while. I originally started, or, I guess, continued to work on the whole brand to play project after graduating. And so I got some small time contracts with University of Alabama to do like some educational tools

8
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.289
Garrett Flynn: for working with biometric data

9
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.080
Garrett Flynn: which went all right.

10
00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:02.689
Garrett Flynn: and then otherwise continue to work with the treatment center up in bel air to do like an application for client management, and the idea would be overdose detection, although we kind of scoped back

11
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.920
Garrett Flynn: that project based off of our hardware constraints and like kind of getting things like spi funding all sorted out.

12
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.160
Garrett Flynn: I'm

13
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:29.399
Garrett Flynn: more recently I ended up having a falling out with my business partner for that. So that kind of sucked II learned a lot through actually doing those projects. But yeah, we just weren't very good fit like, sort of long and short of it as

14
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:40.370
Garrett Flynn: we're trying to work with vulnerable people, you know, minorities, I mean people with disabilities generally, people who like low income people who

15
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.490
Garrett Flynn: can't afford these sort of like thousands of dollar headsets. We wanted to make something that was accessible to everybody

16
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.709
Garrett Flynn: and

17
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.480
Garrett Flynn: My business partner wasn't exactly being respectful of communities like that.

18
00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:08.210
Garrett Flynn: and I had kind of let it lied for longer than I should have, and when I took the stand about it he essentially just like burned every bridge he could as fast as possible which was nuts.

19
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:20.020
Garrett Flynn: So it was just a really weird experience overall. But I mean so glad I went through it at the end of the day, because it kind of put me where I am now, with all this weird Javascript knowledge. But

20
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:34.740
Garrett Flynn: other than that, didn't really pan out how any of us expected it to but at the end of the day it didn't really stay, destabilize me too much. I had been working since February with a group called Narrow Data without borders.

21
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.929
Garrett Flynn: So they're building or maintaining a data standard for neurophysiology data. So essentially, it might have

22
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:56.910
Garrett Flynn: like electrodes stuck in their brains. You're recording all of that data. You have to store it somewhere a lot of times that's in like a custom form out. So like just matlamp files, or some random Cse or things like that. A lot of acquisition systems have their own

23
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:10.719
Garrett Flynn: internal standards. But if you have, you know 20 different devices that are acquiring data. They're not in the same format. And you can't cross. Compare. So this standard basically stores all that data in a like a consistent

24
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.769
Garrett Flynn: format. So that it's it's a Hdf based system. So it's all just hierarchical. And it's one file.

25
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:39.370
Garrett Flynn: And and so I've been helping them create a desktop application for converting data from all those non standard but predictable formats into the data standard automatically. And you, it's like turbotax. You just type in what's missing, and you're good to go. So that's been most of my work. But I have a couple of other contracts. Mary and Tina, my supervisor for the program

26
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.719
Garrett Flynn: connected me with one of her collaborators, and so we've been working together for about 4 months.

27
00:03:45.780 --> 00:04:07.110
Garrett Flynn: and then, right after this I have my first meeting with another contract. So it's it's getting it's getting there. But I would say the General, like bent of it all is like something related to web and something related to neuroscience. I would say that I like very well carved that niche out, at least within, like a very tight technical community.

28
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.830
Garrett Flynn: And so now I'm kind of trying to spin that out in more more breadth and get more contracts around that. So

29
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.930
Sarah Ciston: interesting.

30
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:40.269
Sarah Ciston: Yeah, it's particularly interesting to hear about the sort of like hitting up against the the ethical concerns in a tech community space like, you know, I'm sure, like Marantina is very conscious of all of those those concerns, and how you're, you know, working with vulnerable communities. And then you come to a project. And then you're suddenly like

31
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.600
Sarah Ciston: faced with like

32
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.700
Sarah Ciston: ethical conundrums. And how do you?

33
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:53.130
Sarah Ciston: How do you actually deal with that when when the rubber hits the road, and you have a concern. So it's like

34
00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.300
Sarah Ciston: interesting to me. Because, you know, I'm writing a lot about like, well, how do we make changes in these cultures. And

35
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.420
and

36
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:12.750
Sarah Ciston: it's all well and good to for us to be talking about like. Well, here's how we'd like it to be. But like, how do we put that into practice? And what does that look like and feel like when we get into.

37
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:26.949
Sarah Ciston: you know, designing with communities? Not just for communities. So yeah, totally, yeah. 1 one thing that's actually interesting that I've noticed is, II guess, working with my old business partner. We had like this weird

38
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:46.019
Garrett Flynn: mindset around money and open source, and all this stuff where I mean it. As soon as I hear money, I think, oh, this is gonna be bad. There's there's all these other incentives that kind of muddle all the ethics around this. But I guess what I found in my domain with, you know, like scientific

39
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.140
Garrett Flynn: user facing applications. Essentially,

40
00:05:50.450 --> 00:06:14.740
Garrett Flynn: is, they usually don't have money, and they're for foregrounding ethics. And I've somehow found the ones that do have money, and they usually don't lose them. Actually that fast, as far as I can tell but again, this is mostly academics, or at least serving academics in large part which is, I would say, a little bit of a privileged space, because people are still thinking about that on a day to day basis

41
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:24.200
Sarah Ciston: right? Right? And there do you find that like, it's actually baked in more because they're having to do things like Irbs and

42
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:40.820
Garrett Flynn: think about that as part of their project or yeah, I would. So there's several levels. So for the narrow data without Borders Group, I mean, it's they don't have Irb's because they're not working with human subjects. It's just a data standard but they do have users.

43
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:56.640
Garrett Flynn: And they're, II guess, oriented around developing like, basically like, if if you went to any, I triple E standard document, it's kinda like that, like they're trying to make a tool for engineers. And so they still have, like users that they're accountable to. And they're actually.

44
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:03.099
Garrett Flynn: I don't want to say more discerning than users are in the average sense, but they they have

45
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:15.370
Garrett Flynn: opinions like very heavy opinions about whether this thing works, whether it's useful and things like that. And so they've oriented themselves around satisfying that community in a very robust way, like technical committees, things like that.

46
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.730
Garrett Flynn: I'm

47
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:43.689
Garrett Flynn: so that keeps them in check. And then for us, we're just trying to satisfy them as much as possible. And since our all more, all of our money is government grant based, there's no like extractive mechanic with any of the tools. We're not like trying to sell you on anything except for the fact that it works and that it's useful for you. The the other part is that group specifically publishes everything open source. So like as a blanket statement, that's like

48
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:53.119
Garrett Flynn: at at least at some level, accessible and and accountable. One of the other groups is doing like kind of a medical software system.

49
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.750
Garrett Flynn: And I mean they've had to go through like robust

50
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.289
Garrett Flynn: approval processes for clinical trials and things, so that keeps them accountable, and the other one, which which is relatively new.

51
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:18.569
Garrett Flynn: And they they're the only one that has like Vc. Funding. And I guess I'm interested to see how that hands out in the sense of whose priorities are driven driving. What, how much, say, do I actually have over any of the decisions

52
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.310
Garrett Flynn: things like that. But I guess

53
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:36.169
Garrett Flynn: I interested them because I built stuff that was open source. And they said they could essentially what they want to do is like, have open data sets like hugging face has. But for neurodata, specifically.

54
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.679
Garrett Flynn: And so like.

55
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.250
Garrett Flynn: that's almost inevitably going to be something that is open.

56
00:08:43.390 --> 00:09:02.099
Garrett Flynn: at least for the sake of getting adoption and and getting use and things like that. So maybe it's my II guess it's hard for me to say exactly whether it's my own personal decisions that are making me choose ethical groups of people, or whether it's the communities that I already have connections to that are

57
00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.129
Garrett Flynn: like just that way, to begin with, though

58
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:09.599
Garrett Flynn: I don't really know how to disentangle that. But it could be a mix of both

59
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:24.220
Sarah Ciston: that's so interesting. Yeah, it's like going through those experiences, maybe drives you toward that more like, Oh, II did this this way, and it didn't feel good. So I don't wanna do that anymore. Or

60
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.319
Sarah Ciston: maybe you always started out with that compass. And you're kind of

61
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:45.169
Garrett Flynn: yeah. Well, II think, something. I kind of tried to mention this, at least during my original responses, but I think Code Collective gave me some amount of anesthetic sense around like what is good code and not good in the sense of like, clean

62
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.940
Garrett Flynn: and like readable, but like good, is in like.

63
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.150
Garrett Flynn: effective for a community like, why, a wide range of communities.

64
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.550
Garrett Flynn: And so.

65
00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:02.000
Garrett Flynn: yeah, I mean, like ever, I can very quickly tell you, if I want to work on a project or not, and it's largely guided by that sense, right? Which I think I otherwise

66
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:15.800
Garrett Flynn: probably wouldn't have developed so much without being part of a like critical community of people that I want to share my projects with, because otherwise it's like, Well, I'm getting paid, you know, like $10,000 for this contract, like, what does it matter? You know?

67
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:28.689
Sarah Ciston: Right? Yeah, that's really helpful to hear that sort of like that. It's not just a a critical lens in the sense of like critical theory. But it's about being part of a community, that

68
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.140
Sarah Ciston: is.

69
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:37.590
Sarah Ciston: that is, I mean, in a way, it's like somewhere between, like, Oh, would I be excited to tell my friends about this?

70
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:45.959
Sarah Ciston: But deeper than that, because your friends are also invested in the same kinds of projects and ideas, and

71
00:10:46.010 --> 00:11:02.920
Garrett Flynn: have a sense of criticality, too. Yeah, yeah. Like, I wouldn't want to come on this meeting and tell you that I've been working on like this like close down like Nda protected like, maybe government like defense project. I wouldn't want to do that

72
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:23.800
Sarah Ciston: right, I mean, and you could like III do. I think you know, I've been trying to think about like, well, what do we do when we don't agree with each other and like, How does that, you know I like, I still want it to be an open space. And we've had people come in. I think this was like, mostly after you were around

73
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:30.720
Sarah Ciston: actively. We've had people come in who are like, I'm super into nfts. And I wanna do this.

74
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:46.570
Sarah Ciston: Their their course has somewhat changed over the time that they've been around us because of that. But it was never because we were like, well, that's evil like it's just like because we sort of

75
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:56.430
Sarah Ciston: picked up on their questions about it or misgivings about it, and would have open conversations. Yeah, yeah, I think that's kind of where the like

76
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:18.119
Garrett Flynn: conventional critical aspect of this comes in is like there. I could work on a defense project and come in. I wouldn't necessarily be proud to talk about it, but I would if I had something to say critically about it. Right like this is why I'm doing it, you know. These are the consequences of me doing that, but II guess maybe that's what it is. Is. If I came in

77
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.479
Garrett Flynn: working for a project like that and I couldn't articulate, why.

78
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:29.189
Garrett Flynn: that would be a problem. You know what I mean like, it's less of the specifics of the project itself and more related to the fact that

79
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:37.720
Garrett Flynn: I need to realize it's an active choice, and that there are other options, and that there may be externalities to that decision.

80
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.620
Garrett Flynn: And so we, I think that

81
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.539
Garrett Flynn: in my time with the collective. I felt like it's been like

82
00:12:46.220 --> 00:13:00.830
Garrett Flynn: cause when you walk in, you don't really know whether what's like your ethical sense isn't really there necessarily, at least, you can kind of just as a blanket statement say that as people walk in, they're not part of the community yet, so they don't know the norms

83
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:19.099
Garrett Flynn: right. But as you get involved, you kind of learn the boundaries you learn like new perspectives and a lot of times. II guess this is the sense that I got when I was involved is, people are just excited to share whatever they're involved in, and you get critical feedback back.

84
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.290
Garrett Flynn: but it's never. It's always warm.

85
00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.300
Garrett Flynn: And so you kind of don't real like. If I came in working for a defense project

86
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:39.539
Garrett Flynn: we would talk about it, but it wouldn't be like immediately like, why are you doing this? It's like, Oh, what are you doing like Yada? Yada? Yada, right? And then you get to the point where you walk away with a new perspective on what it is. And

87
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:50.429
Garrett Flynn: yeah, like. you can't walk into a community like this and be turned off by warmth. unless you already know that what you're doing is wrong.

88
00:13:50.540 --> 00:14:05.509
Garrett Flynn: You know what I mean, and a lot like working with like for me, working with all the brain technologies and coming in like, there was some good questions raised around, like, What are we doing with the data and things like that. And again, it was all like kind of probing and like, in a curious sense.

89
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:33.730
Sarah Ciston: And I gave you answers, and I didn't know whether they were right or wrong, and so I wouldn't know that without actually talking. And and if I did know that it was bad, then I wouldn't want to do it, and then I would probably leave right right. And I mean, that's how we figure out, too, like I don't. I think with my own projects. I don't always know upfront, because who could possibly think of all of the repercussions or all of the factors in a situation that they're starting to explore, right?

90
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.440
Sarah Ciston: So it's not like

91
00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:43.270
Sarah Ciston: an oracle like, come to us. We already know all the answers. It's like, we're all here figuring out together.

92
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.930
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, yeah, totally.

93
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.809
Sarah Ciston: I mean, I I'm trying to think how how

94
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:55.800
Sarah Ciston: ethically questionable something would have to be for me to be like. Oh, no.

95
00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:05.260
Garrett Flynn: but I'm sure there's a line somewhere. But I would like to think, I think also again, it's kind of this warmth aspect, like if I came to you telling you that I was like

96
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:16.299
Garrett Flynn: literally sticking like I'm in my basement. I'm like sticking probes into people's heads like you, probably just just knowing the community like Samira. Like everybody.

97
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.389
Garrett Flynn: I wouldn't expect you to go. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! That's wrong, you know you'd go.

98
00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:26.560
Garrett Flynn: What? Why, you know? Like, it's more. Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:40.310
Garrett Flynn: Are you really like, what was your consent process like for the exactly, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It wouldn't be immediate, like distaste. It would be much more like very probing questions leading to

100
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:58.829
Garrett Flynn: well, maybe you shouldn't do that. And maybe I'll report you because that is wrong. Have you considered not doing that? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. But I honestly, I think, reflecting back at Usc in general, too, like the media arts and practice program, I think that was very common.

101
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:07.170
Garrett Flynn: Oh, people were but that was also, I think, guided by the fact that we were in a class in an academic institution together.

102
00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.169
Garrett Flynn: that people people didn't necessarily like what you were doing.

103
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.220
Garrett Flynn: but they always framed their questions in a respectful way.

104
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:21.659
Sarah Ciston: That's good, I mean, that's not always true. That was going to be. My next question is, do you feel like that style of

105
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.099
Sarah Ciston: feedback? Specifically, even having like

106
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:32.110
Sarah Ciston: critical feedback at all, or like both the warmth piece or the critical ethical.

107
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:44.039
Sarah Ciston:  questions, do you? Do you feel like you get that from other places? Also? Either in technic, technical communities or scientific communities or

108
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.549
Sarah Ciston: aesthetic communities? Or

109
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:54.190
Sarah Ciston: is this more specific to like map and code collective?

110
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.910
Garrett Flynn: I mean.

111
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:02.500
Garrett Flynn: I would say, if it happens at all, it always happens after hours like it's not a billable activity.

112
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:07.319
Garrett Flynn: I'm an independent contractor. So that's that's kind of natural, in a sense.

113
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:11.060
Garrett Flynn:  and then otherwise

114
00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:24.810
Garrett Flynn: I don't know. II went to like under a tech meetup for the first time, like 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks ago. and it was nice. I mean, I had a conversation with some people who were

115
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:35.239
Garrett Flynn: like somebody was moving into like la, like they were gonna become a law student, so they could work on like the ethics of like these sort of brain technologies and things. Very directly.

116
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:42.300
Garrett Flynn: Others were just gonna go the academic route, get a Phd. And stuff. They were all usually underclassmen. I'm

117
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:49.769
Garrett Flynn: and you know I brought up some some ethical concerns, and like resources and things like that.

118
00:17:49.800 --> 00:18:07.459
Garrett Flynn: and I think the investment was very low. but I cause I don't know if it was like the the Forum, or what, but like I didn't get a strong like immediate feedback that they were like going to follow up on this and do anything about it in a sense.

119
00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:16.489
Garrett Flynn: and not not that anything that they were doing was questionable. It was just more of like a Here's here's something to consider right? And so I think.

120
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:24.180
Garrett Flynn: with regards to code collective it. I knew we were there for that. So it was a lot

121
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.049
Garrett Flynn: easier to understand

122
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.710
Garrett Flynn: both what to say to somebody else and to know that you're gonna get that feedback.

123
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:42.520
Garrett Flynn: But but yeah, I mean as a as a broad statement, I would say it really isn't that common? But I also don't. I would say I don't really participate

124
00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:50.470
Garrett Flynn: super actively in those communities right now, I want to. But I just haven't found one post graduation. I think I saw. I'm

125
00:18:51.060 --> 00:19:20.020
Garrett Flynn: do you go to crash space. Or have you been okay? Okay? II asked because I followed them on Facebook or something or Instagram, and you were also following them. So II was just curious. It's a maker space. By Culver City, ish? It's like you can walk in if you have a certain level of membership. Otherwise they have, like weekly meetings on Tuesdays.

126
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.440
Garrett Flynn: One of their recent programming events was

127
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:38.440
Garrett Flynn: like learning how to do like PCB, kind of stuff, and I think they had a cat themed. So they like brought these kits, and you could like make like hack, make and hack this like chip. It was kind of cool.

128
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:48.219
Garrett Flynn: so II was thinking of going somewhere like that, and I would be curious to get an answer to your question of whether these communities are equally as critical. And

129
00:19:49.400 --> 00:20:04.999
Garrett Flynn: but I don't know quite yet. Yeah, if you do like, let me know. I'd be curious to check some stuff out while I'm here. Yeah, yeah, that's kind of my goal, too. I'll probably be. I'm in La until my girlfriend graduates from Usc, so it'll be about

130
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.550
Garrett Flynn: 2 or 3 more years.

131
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.579
Sarah Ciston: Okay, yeah, cool.

132
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:25.670
Sarah Ciston: I'm here most of next semester. And then, depending on what my job hunt reveals. I'm hoping that I will be back in Berlin. But we'll, you know, have to go where I am wanted for sure, for sure.

133
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.890
Sarah Ciston: Yeah.

134
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:48.530
Sarah Ciston:  yeah, that's so interesting to that. I'm I'm like, really happy that these are the kind of takeaways that people have been reporting from code collective. But I also did not go in with a conscious intention that that's what the group should be. It was more like.

135
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:56.910
Sarah Ciston: I don't feel super welcome in or comfortable in the spaces, and I have this weird

136
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:11.099
Sarah Ciston: approach that mixes genres that edit. So I don't really feel like I fit. And so I just wanted a space where we could feel comfortable to do it, whichever way we wanted, like code, any which way.

137
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:17.700
Sarah Ciston: And this sort of critical approach. I guess

138
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.310
with a

139
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.620
Sarah Ciston: it was a bonus. But it also is kind of come to be the core of in a way.

140
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:31.880
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, yeah, I think one of the strengths of the community was that. I mean, if II look at a place like crash space.

141
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:50.689
Garrett Flynn: it's it runs a little 2 maker for me like I wanna be part of the maker community. But I also am not in a sense like I don't do a lot of like tangible physical development of things, and II guess I want to. But going into those communities as somebody who writes software

142
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.509
Garrett Flynn: almost exclusively.

143
00:21:52.590 --> 00:22:02.610
Garrett Flynn: I don't really know where I fit, or if I'll fit. And there's a big learning curve there. On the other hand, there, in terms of software communities

144
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.119
Garrett Flynn: that I know of.

145
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:23.610
Garrett Flynn: there's like Jsla, or like Javascript communities across like the Us. And such. But that's language specific. and I haven't really been to any of their events. I I'm intending to go as well. They they have like a lunch event like the first Tuesday of every month, or something.

146
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:29.120
Garrett Flynn: I'm I'm intending to go to see what the kind of general vibes are there.

147
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:55.160
Garrett Flynn: but I don't anticipate that it'll have the same like high level, like scope that something like code collective does. And I think in general it's very hard to get people out of their, you know, once they graduate out of their professional communities and their like tool communities, it starts to become like in the same way that academia is. It tends to get very siloed very quickly. And and

148
00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:04.079
Garrett Flynn: I haven't seen a good community to participate in. That is both specific enough to be useful and general enough to be interesting.

149
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.659
Sarah Ciston: I like that.

150
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.350
Sarah Ciston:  yeah, I think that sort of

151
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.800
Sarah Ciston: also helps make it

152
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:26.440
Sarah Ciston: grow because you could kind of trade skills with each other, too, like if we were all in the same

153
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:45.159
Sarah Ciston: if we it was only Javascript, like I'm you know, there's plenty. There's always going to be more libraries and more to learn about Javascript. But if it was like. we want to combine things in weird ways you're gonna have somebody who is working on. You're gonna have someone who's working on bci

154
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:51.599
Sarah Ciston: somebody who's doing like live instruments like it lets you

155
00:23:51.720 --> 00:24:04.309
Garrett Flynn: jump around and like, teach each other in a different way, too? Totally. Yeah. Well, it's also, I think, at that point about craft, and it's not about the craft of a website or a craft of like

156
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:12.490
Garrett Flynn: Python analytics system. It's about the craft of creating something with code that can span all of these boundaries.

157
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.919
Garrett Flynn: And and again, you don't really get

158
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:34.009
Garrett Flynn: a wide conversation about those sorts of things. I mean, I'm even thinking, like, you know, you were saying, there's always gonna be a new Javascript library right? But somebody from Python is like, Well, why are these frameworks so crazy like there's a new one every day. And are they really that much better like those sorts of questions? Don't

159
00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:45.600
Garrett Flynn: really get asked unless you're looking outside of Javascript. I mean, people ask it, but they don't take it seriously, because it's just. It's the water you drink in the air you breathe when you're a web developer, right? So

160
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:55.189
Garrett Flynn:  like those sorts of things are interesting or like, you know, somebody's coming from a different language. And they say, like, Does this language have that tool? It would be really cool or like.

161
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.519
Garrett Flynn: You know what sort of capabilities you have, and you don't.

162
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.510
Garrett Flynn: You both don't reinvent the wheel because another language hasn't, and you can like, sort of pick and choose

163
00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:12.709
Garrett Flynn: in a more informed way by by having this sort of like language agnostic discussion about code.

164
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.260
Sarah Ciston: Yeah, that's that's really, that's such a good point. It's like.

165
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:43.159
Sarah Ciston: cause you, yeah, right, you're in that like, this is water. This is the only way this is done. I have this very like pythonic way of thinking about it, or this very specific way. And instead, you could be like, Oh, well, in, you know, Javascript, we do it this way or in. You know. C. Sharp, you could do this. Has anyone ported it to rust or whatever? Right? Yeah, I like that.

166
00:25:43.560 --> 00:26:04.550
Sarah Ciston: It also is making me think of what you said in your initial responses about teaching and mentorship, and that being a sort of like surprising aspect of it, for you wanted to say more about that. Has that like continued for you, or was sort of the draw in the first place, or what?

167
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:17.059
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, what would you? Yeah, I mean. well, II think just giving a general idea of like my timeline, and like also participation in code collective, like.

168
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.969
Garrett Flynn: I ended up kind of questioning what I was doing in a neuroscience lab

169
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:47.980
Garrett Flynn: while in code collective. Not necessarily. II it's hard for me to say, as a consequence, because, like it all gets fuzzy in retrospect. But I mean, I was thinking about like, you know, is anybody actually get it was building a like a memory process for people with Alzheimer's and dementia like targeted brain stimulation kind of stuff. And I was like, is anybody gonna use this like, is it actually gonna get into clinics? And if it does, who's going to use it? Is there gonna be pushback? Because it's like

170
00:26:47.980 --> 00:27:08.869
Garrett Flynn: literally stimulating the cognitive parts of your brain. There's a lot of ethical and just general, like philosophical questions around that that aren't really answered. And so you know, what can we do about that? Ended up running our organizing like an Ih administrative supplement to a actually ask people who are implanted with these devices what they thought.

171
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:21.500
Garrett Flynn: and also people with like a high risk of Alzheimer's disease or biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, whether they would actually want something like this or not, so that it wasn't just like a post talk like the the family of the

172
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:33.210
Garrett Flynn: patient decides for them. You actually kind of at least at the early stages, understand the psychology of the people that would actually have these things. and and that that was really cool. I think

173
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:48.310
Garrett Flynn: once I started going like really hard into like the brain computer interface on a web browsers thing I know. I talked several times with code collective, but I think it kind of dropped off during what? After the pandemic, as as I think you probably noticed that it was.

174
00:27:48.350 --> 00:28:00.960
Garrett Flynn: There's just kind of a weird, weird phase at that point about how how to involve people right, and also like time constraints, and when meetings happen and things like that. But

175
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:14.440
Garrett Flynn: I after that kind of shift away from the sort of technical like how to do this brain implant stuff to the like ethical and like kind of accessibility side of how and why we would want to do this.

176
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.409
Garrett Flynn: And I ended up mentoring like several

177
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.400
Garrett Flynn: kids in high school who are part of this. It's called the Knowledge Society

178
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:50.589
Garrett Flynn: group. So it's like a group of really high powered high schoolers who get trained in entrepreneurship and development. And all these things, and they take on like projects, and one of them, like one of the bins that they organize their projects around was bring computer interfaces. So I got, I probably at least talked to like 10 to 15 students over like a year and a half, and like kind of hands on, mentored about 3 or 4.

179
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.880
Garrett Flynn: I thought that was really rewarding.

180
00:28:53.950 --> 00:29:05.640
Garrett Flynn: And I've done several other like public engagement projects. So Mary and Tina organize this like Burn Camp kind of things for kids with burn injuries.

181
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:23.040
Garrett Flynn: So it was at Usc. They had like a bunch of activities because of burn injuries, and one of them, I was invited to like have them play like a brain controlled game by like it was, it wasn't brain controlled. They were blinking and moving a character, and the character would jump when you blinked, and you'd kind of have like this

182
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.350
Garrett Flynn: collaborative aspect where you

183
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:41.699
Garrett Flynn:  There was 2 characters you were trying to race across the screen. It was like a platformer. And if you you know, couldn't use your hands, or if you just wanted to experiment with this sort of collaborative aspect, like your brother would actually control the movement, and you just control the jumping.

184
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.630
Garrett Flynn: Aye, cool.

185
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:56.519
Garrett Flynn: So yeah, that that was really fun. So II would say II don't think my eyes would have really been turned to these sorts of like educational mentorship activities without having first

186
00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:03.000
Garrett Flynn: gotten acquainted with that in code collective or really just like having my eyes open within

187
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:13.049
Garrett Flynn: the Polymathic Academy code collective, that kind of whole mill you at Usc. because I mean my media arts and practice thesis

188
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:22.010
Garrett Flynn: was like a visions and voices event that I was gonna run that got kind of derailed during the pandemic. And the only reason I did that was because Curtis told me that I could.

189
00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.719
Garrett Flynn: So I did and by extension, and I would have never even thought about

190
00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:38.429
Garrett Flynn:  creating like the the end product was like a website that compared your like brain data across like different locations because of Covid like that would have never happened without

191
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:49.590
Garrett Flynn: both the pandemic and code collective, and the an initial pitch was very heavily influenced by code collective, just by the fact that it was like kind of brain to brain synchronization

192
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:55.129
Garrett Flynn: kind of a visualization, and like a shared space. And all this sort of stuff. So

193
00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:07.979
Garrett Flynn: like the fact that I'm even really wanting to present my work to people. And then by extension also, like really heavily involving them in some tangible like experience. I even think back to like.

194
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:28.610
Garrett Flynn: I think it was also your presentation for map like there was these showcases, every semester every year whatever. And I would go into those spaces and be like, this is really cool. I wanna do something like this where you're actually like, actively involved with something in the physical space. But it's all kind of conditioned upon a lot of software

195
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.259
Garrett Flynn: And so I would say, there's kind of 2 levels to that. One is.

196
00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:52.410
Garrett Flynn: I wanted to help other people with sort of things that I was familiar with, and give sort of this critical feedback to them in the early stages, so that they would be able to kind of adapt accordingly. That that's been kind of a through line for me is, I mean at first, in code collective. It was the people in John's

197
00:31:52.550 --> 00:32:22.329
Garrett Flynn: class where they would come in and be like, I'd have no idea what processing is. I'm like, here you go. And then. That's that's come all the way to like mentoring these students and saying, You know what? You probably shouldn't take this approach because it's too costly, or it like just doesn't make development sense. You should go this way and kind of like putting people on rails in some cases to kind of handle that the use case they want, and then the other side is, in addition to wanting to help people wanting to like

198
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:31.890
Garrett Flynn: go people cause II would say that I tend not to hold off showing or sharing until like the very end.

199
00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:42.759
Garrett Flynn: And that was a really hard part of map for me was like showing anything, and I would say even I would say my like curve of like showing stuff

200
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:59.319
Garrett Flynn: was like peaked around like Covid map and code collective, and has kind of gone back down because they I just don't have that community anymore. But I think that that was like a really rewarding part of being in the community. It was just like

201
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:08.649
Garrett Flynn: at like kind of beyond the getting critical feedback was having a space to get it. In the first place.

202
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:10.560
Sarah Ciston: that's that's great.

203
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:28.029
Sarah Ciston: Yeah. Well, you're always so. Yeah, meetings are sporadic right now. But I do. We have been doing some online while I've been in Berlin, and you're always II wanna do a couple of hybrid while I'm here. Get people together semi in person, and you're always

204
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:50.789
Sarah Ciston: would be welcome to join us that as well. If you have time. I know you're also doing many, many things, wearing many hats now. For sure. Yeah, if you want to invite me to like. If you have a calendar, invite, or anything, or just a time I can put down, then that would be great. But yeah, I don't know for the in person ones. Now we'll probably look at the the new semester

205
00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:58.420
Sarah Ciston: and it's all on the disc. It's all been through discord. So I don't know how much.

206
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.290
Sarah Ciston: But yeah, I can like

207
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:04.620
Sarah Ciston: at you on the discord, if that works or

208
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:16.869
Garrett Flynn: yeah, I can also just follow along. If I know it's there. I haven't monitored the discord very much, but that's just because I don't know that I should be so I'll just bring that to the top of my

209
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:24.039
Garrett Flynn: system there. So yeah, I haven't been as good about like sending emails out wide to everybody.

210
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:39.509
Sarah Ciston: We have like a small core group. It's mostly been Samir and Elia, and sometimes Adda, or and then a couple of people from outside like who have just found us randomly

211
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.870
Sarah Ciston: through through the Internet, who are amazing.

212
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:56.790
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's one thing. You just get gems in code collective. Just yeah. I mean a lot of people like II at least saw like a lot of turnover. But there's a lot of people that come in and are like, really interested, and I don't think we ever

213
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:07.129
Garrett Flynn: try to push them away, or that they I mean, a lot of times. They just come and stay and hang out. But there's always like again, kind of this core group that's like, just like.

214
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:26.300
Garrett Flynn: even now blows me away. And now, Samir, starting a chapter in Santa Cruz. Yeah, yeah. I actually saw him. I was up in the bay and and we met up. Yeah. So we're talking about doing like a joint lead up at some point.

215
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:32.200
Sarah Ciston: Yeah, yeah. So that would be great if we can get that off the ground.

216
00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.999
Sarah Ciston:  But yeah, I don't know.

217
00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:53.140
Sarah Ciston: I was just thinking, as you were talking about that I was thinking about the first time I met you when you came into code collective, and you like the thing that you said. I still talk about this. You blew my mind cause you were like I know how to code, but like, how would I use code for art?

218
00:35:53.470 --> 00:36:01.970
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, yeah. And I was like, what broke my brain. It's funny. Why? Why is that

219
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:14.300
Sarah Ciston: I feel like? Because I was so in a like creative coding like. And then, since then we've had more people come from Cs, but I think you were the first person coming from like

220
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:19.689
Sarah Ciston: cog side neuroscience. Cs kind of side, except maybe like

221
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:21.330
Sarah Ciston: Samir.

222
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:29.479
But like they were also already doing pretty creative. They they were already in a creative, coding mindset. So I'd never

223
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:54.030
Garrett Flynn: like straight up, hung out with somebody who was like, I have the analytical part. I just don't have the creative part. I only been working with people who had the creative part but needed the technical skills like we had Robbie come in who was like, I've never touched any code before. But I wanna code. And I was like, Oh, great! But I never met anybody who had the opposite. And I was like, this is so. That was like

224
00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:07.689
Sarah Ciston: the moment for me that, like code, collective really clicked in this extra way where I thought. you know, I thought I was helping like one audience. which was great. But then I realized, there's actually

225
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.750
Sarah Ciston: 2 or like multiple variations of this audience, that it

226
00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.290
Garrett Flynn: is just as useful. For, like

227
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.220
Sarah Ciston: technically trained people just as much.

228
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.120
Garrett Flynn: Yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense. I would. I would say, I.

229
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.040
That question still lingered in my mind until.

230
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:33.370
Garrett Flynn: like I finished map, like, I really like I kinda got it.

231
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.779
Garrett Flynn: But I didn't feel like I got it up until that point.

232
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:44.960
Garrett Flynn:  and II guess that's kind of led. It's it's a big driver, for where I am

233
00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:52.949
Garrett Flynn: now, in the sense that I feel very comfortable with that, like I whenever I come across really anybody learning the program.

234
00:37:52.990 --> 00:38:15.370
Garrett Flynn: even if they're had like Cs heavy, or want to go see us heavy. I go make make some art stuff like, just go like make some cool art stuff cause like the graphics is like the graphics aspect was really compelling, more so than than like learning straight python. Like I really really loved working with, because it gave me this like

235
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.260
Garrett Flynn: familiarity with

236
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:33.599
Garrett Flynn: like a little bit of design. At least II was working with. I didn't even know that it was with Javascript at first. Took off. You learned one day, and then we're just like I've programmed this entire pro

237
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:56.980
Garrett Flynn: platform for doing presentations. And here we are. Yeah, yeah. But but again, I think even after that, I didn't. Really, it didn't click to me that was art or like that it like like I didn't know where it sat. And I was like, everybody else, is doing these like really cool, like things like, I'm just like trying to push like a square peg into a round hole. I don't get it, you know.

238
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:05.930
Garrett Flynn: but a again I think it's more of. And I think this kind of comes across with code collective in general, like, it's more of a process than it is a product

239
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:15.640
Garrett Flynn: like the fact that you're in involved at all is kind of the art aspect or not necessarily like exactly what you're doing and what you're what you've made and such.

240
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:29.910
Sarah Ciston: Yeah, that's great that this totally resonates with what I've been writing about, too, like everything you've said about craft and about process. And this, this is actually encouraging to hear, too, about the like, go make art, or that

241
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.030
Sarah Ciston: it's interesting that you felt like you didn't quite get

242
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:41.830
Sarah Ciston: it for a while that, like you were already making art. Because I think for many people coming to code from a

243
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:52.850
Sarah Ciston: a creative space, they often feeling like they're not yet coders, even if they're coding. That never goes away. But I think

244
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.299
Sarah Ciston: that's helpful to remember that people might not

245
00:39:56.590 --> 00:40:11.500
Garrett Flynn: be feeling creative yet, either. Yeah, yeah, II think I would describe it as I definitely from the get go. Felt like I was playing, but I didn't. I don't know where that crosses the line into art, and I think a lot of it had to do with.

246
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.690
Garrett Flynn: So for me, I wasn't really part of either the art or the

247
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:23.779
Garrett Flynn: topsy community like II was largely self taught around all of this, and

248
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:37.539
Garrett Flynn: one thing that stood out to me is like has always stood out to me as advice. But I just still, even now, don't feel like I've really nailed is the whole like documentation and portfolio side of things like

249
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:46.069
Garrett Flynn: like, I guess portfolio is more on the art side. Documentation is more on the code side. But like merging those 2 together in a meaningful way. And like.

250
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.790
Garrett Flynn: that's why I like code collective because it wasn't this like

251
00:40:50.340 --> 00:41:05.200
Garrett Flynn: contrived sharing of stuff. It was very organic and didn't require me to kind of conform to those sorts of forms. But I think that that was kind of a conundrum. That again, I'm still to some extent trying to figure out is like.

252
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:06.780
Garrett Flynn: how

253
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.689
Garrett Flynn: how is it ultimately packaged

254
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:18.330
Garrett Flynn: in a way that is consumable? And I didn't feel like I had enough familiarity to package something for the artist.

255
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:32.229
Garrett Flynn: and I definitely was not even trying to package it for the cops I people. but like it was more of like a like a digestion. Kind of thing like was was what I had created, palatable, almost

256
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:42.489
Garrett Flynn: And at the end of the day it didn't really matter, cause it was. It's all like still documentation and like process documentation and things like that. I realized it wasn't

257
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.310
Garrett Flynn: as there aren't a killer lines about how to do that.

258
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.460
Garrett Flynn: And you know, whatever artifact you have at the end of the day is.

259
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.919
Garrett Flynn: it's not necessarily always good enough, but it's good enough

260
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.009
Garrett Flynn: for most things, so you don't have to think about it all that much

261
00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.500
Sarah Ciston: right. And because our our processes were so focused on

262
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:14.120
Sarah Ciston: talking about the works that were in progress rather than a finished object or deliverable. I think, like that really changes the like.

263
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:25.949
Sarah Ciston: Okay, I'm critiquing the report, or I'm critiquing the finished product, or I'm critiquing the artwork we're talking about. Here's where I am in the middle of this. And here's the questions that I have.

264
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.219
Sarah Ciston: and that makes it easier. But I still have that. You know II talk a lot in the

265
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:58.269
Garrett Flynn: book that I'm writing about code, collective about documentation being super important. But I'm still like the worst it's like, don't you know? Take my advice, but I need to take my own advice. Yeah, yeah, II guess the thing for me is like I didn't. I don't think I fully understood that a slice of your work in the middle of reaching your end goal is still a deliverable like it. It's something tangible that people want to see and like represents your work in your process.

266
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.720
Garrett Flynn: I don't think that was something that I

267
00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.530
Garrett Flynn: like. Felt

268
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:10.540
Garrett Flynn: like I didn't. I didn't really wanna do that. I wanted the end thing. And so I just kept going and going and going and never really reaching it.

269
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:21.500
Garrett Flynn: And then eventually kind of realize that that's the point of just like continuing to like. Push your craft as far as possible, and in the meantime kind of like throwing things off.

270
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:32.300
Garrett Flynn: cause I like. I'm sure you feel the same way like you just kind of pick up thing after thing after thing, and you kind of have to close off one. But then the next one's already going.

271
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:37.259
Garrett Flynn: So like, like, I was really invested in finishing

272
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:43.219
Garrett Flynn: when it's just never ending to begin with, yeah. And if you wait for it to be perfect and finished.

273
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:48.950
Sarah Ciston: yeah, until you get feedback, you're never gonna get the feedback you need for it to be finished.

274
00:43:48.970 --> 00:44:01.750
Sarah Ciston: finished enough. And sometimes you just have to be like, Okay, I'm calling this phase of it done because the next project I'm going to deal with the same themes and the same questions through a different

275
00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.349
Sarah Ciston: tool or a different lens. Because I'm always gonna care about the same things. And I'm gonna come back to that.

276
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:16.169
Sarah Ciston: Yeah. it's it's, you know. It's the trouble with having a life's work

277
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.750
totally.

278
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:28.500
Sarah Ciston: And I know you have another big meeting next. So I want to give you a little space in between if you have to jump onto your next call. Yeah.

279
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.170
Sarah Ciston: but it's so good.

280
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:38.870
Garrett Flynn: Yeah. I mean if I still have at least 5 min, if II would love to hear what you're up to. I knew you said you were in Berlin, but for what? Again?

281
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:59.180
Sarah Ciston: Yeah. So I did. An artist Residency last year. Which culminated in a big exhibition this summer. Yeah. So we it was all about like different approaches to AI and machine learning through artistic and subversive lenses. So it was like AI and Ethics

282
00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:05.449
Sarah Ciston: Residency. Or what program is this? It was through a museum in Berlin.

283
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.009
Sarah Ciston: and it was a a

284
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:22.880
Sarah Ciston: 6 months like Residential Residency, where they pay, and you have a studio, and you work there and then we put up the exhibition and it the exhibition was up for a month, so I was doing that.

285
00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:49.339
Sarah Ciston: and I'm also trying to establish like permanent residency there. So I can like, I'm looking for post docs and professorships there now, and mostly just finishing the dissertation which I need to. I'll be defending in February. So it's coming up very soon and like Phd.

286
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:58.890
Sarah Ciston: partly about code, collective, like a guidebook, about how to create spaces like code collective and then partly about

287
00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.860
Sarah Ciston: intersectional approaches to machine learning. So

288
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:10.580
Garrett Flynn: yeah, I'm glad you're able to wrap up. II guess I knew you were doing the AI stuff.

289
00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:19.209
Garrett Flynn: I knew you were doing code collective, but I didn't know if you were like. you know, package up code collective in some way. So I'm really happy to see that as well, cause I think it.

290
00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:39.719
Garrett Flynn: at least in my mind, should be instructive. I'm gonna I'm gonna go through whatever documentation you have at the end, and see what I can glean from that, too. Thanks. Yeah, that's very kind of you. I I'm trying to take my own advice about documentation. Now, finally, yeah. Well, well, again, I think that II haven't seen any good communities

291
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.500
Garrett Flynn: post grad that really bridge these spaces, as

292
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.559
Garrett Flynn: I guess someone who still verges

293
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:56.909
Garrett Flynn: more technical, like, really, really technical. like. I'm sure there's a lot of art art communities that I could get involved in where there's like, not just code happening.

294
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:15.899
Garrett Flynn: But I tend to be much more on the side of just going to the code ones and then being dissatisfied with the fact that it's not as I'd like it to be. Yeah, I mean, I think even the art ones are not as critical as I would like to or as welcoming either. Unfortunately, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

295
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.050
Sarah Ciston: cool.

296
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:35.709
Sarah Ciston: Well, keep me posted on what you're up to. I also met another artist working with Bci stuff that I wanted to connect you with. I forget her name. But I met her at ours electronica, and she's doing crazy like fashion design Bci controlled stuff that
Sarah Ciston: I was like she was like, if you know anybody who's working on stuff. And I was like I do, I could probably call. II think I know who this is. Okay. Yeah, she's based in New York.

Sarah Ciston: she reminded me of Benaz's work. But it's not Benaz. Yeah. I'll send you a link to her work, and if you're interested I'll put you in touch.
Sarah Ciston: Okay, yeah. You, too, have a great day. Yeah, best of luck with the rest of your program, too. Bye.

first impressions? Wow, so long ago? This is probably back in like maybe freshman year, like Freshman Spring or something. I saw a poster or email that mentioned code collective and there's an email that I could email and I guess it was you. Or no. I think it was a for a Google format. first. So I signed up, and then I came to the first meeting.

And I was curious. I wish i'd remember what the what the form had said, but it was something about like creative coding, and I was like, I don't know what i'm gonna do yet. But that sounds really close to what I want to do. They came. There were lots of different people from many disciplines. And we just talked about what we were interested in, and had, like some discussions about like creative ways to use code. 
And that was a really exciting first meeting for me, and then for a while kind of dropped off, because I think I can fit fit in my schedule, or I think, at one point I was like I can make the meetings but now, but but I've like already missed so many that I feel really awkward going back because I felt like I didn't really know anybody, and I didn't want to like barge back in. I didn't know like what necessarily the culture was so I wish I had gone back. I could have had more meetings but at some point I started coming back, and became a regular and then like more and more.

I felt like, Oh, it's like not just like something that Sarah's leading, but also like we're all part of this club, and like we can sort of like talk about whatever we want to it's like what we make of it A. And so now like to me, **the club is like something that's like our home for like discussing and sharing and doing creative code things together**. and it's just like a really positive and safe and exciting environment to be in. 

_Do you know what the things were that let you know that you could make it your own?_

I think it's definitely like the tone that you set of like, I feel like these are things that you you said over and over again. That it's like it's not something it's not like you're you know, like the teacher and like for the students, and like you there's like a like a schedule for each session but it's more like we group of like-minded people who all have things to learn from each other, and cool things that we're working on. 
And so like I feel like it's like natural when you go and you talk to other people. You're like Oh, that's so cool that you're doing so and so like I want to learn more and then the it sort of naturally evolves from there.

**Collective is a collaborative co-working co-learning place for people who are curious about code or are curious about creative ways to use code or code-y ways to be creative. And it's a very welcoming environment, and there's a lot, though we can come and learn together.**

Creative code collective: Come code collaboratively
Okay, all the although, like Co. **the prefix is, is really feels really relevant, like collating, co-working, collaborating just doing things together.**

>what are the essential part essential components of code collective, what parts are important to you like, technically, socially, emotionally, collaboratively, artistically, politically, what makes it what makes it go vroom

**I think the snacks are definitely a big draw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid. I think the the fact that we all like making each other feel like we're all an equal part of the community in terms of, we all have stuff to share, even if it's not like products that we're working on. We have like opinions about things, and we can offer opinions on each other's projects or answers to questions.**

So I think that's really good and in in circumstances where it's like, I think something that I've noticed is like sometimes people who aren't as vocal or proactive in speaking up because I feel like so, sometimes where i'm like like, Other people will be like here's just like out of the blue like, "Here's a project that I'm working on, check it out, it's so cool." And then sort of my my instinct in a lot of situations is I won't necessarily speak, unless asked about it, which I try to be more proactive sometimes, but sometimes that is what I fall back on.

**And so the culture of encouraging each other, and like proactively asking after each other, I think has been really helpful for me.** In terms of asking each other, "What have you been working on, or what do you think of this?" Even when that person isn't necessarily the first to speak up 

'''
<<XXX>>
_or answer to say like proactively asking after each other, I like that._
'''

>>I like that I don't think that that's something that I would like consciously built in, or it felt affected at first. But it really it feels really important it's kind of my favorite part of the meeting.

Now, it always kind of **turns into the whole meeting like there's never a point where it's not that we just sort of unconsciously segue into the troubleshooting of one of the things that people share, yeah show and tell.**

>How would you describe the code collective approach to coding? Does the working, teaching, learning, making style feel different in any way?

Yeah, I feel like I don't I feel like i'm still thinking about this a lot because I feel like by this point we've kind of collected a bunch of regulars. But the regulars that come at this point are people who are more comfortable with code.

I would say and are always working on it project and usually like comfortable with whatever technology that we're talking about, or at least familiar with it or heard of it.

Have some kind of connect, like understanding of how to connect to it. That kind of thing. 

I don't know if, like we haven't been sort of making enough space for people who are more beginners. So I'm still thinking about that. 

But **I think the idea of it has always been to create a space where you don't have to know everything. And it's not like class where you come and you're everyone's working towards one point, and how good you are is it is defined by how well you know the technology, how well you can do something.** Because, the club is like inherently multidisciplinary, so people will have different strengths, a different background. And so **we'll be working with different things. and we'll come with different assumptions about things,** and so the idea is we can <<XXX>> by sort of co-learning and co-working.

We can offer our own unique perspectives. and then, like certifying joy in like the process of like learning, and like going through the journey together. <<XXX Who said this?>>

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, yeah, I Yeah. I think The The goal is always to work towards a culture of encouraging scrappy code.

**And being okay with not being the best at every tool in technology.**

<<ME>>
>>**The approach is that it is possible to learn any part of it. We're not gonna come in knowing everything we're not gonna leave knowing everything either.Everybody comes in with the expectation of capacity, like even if somebody comes in cold, we are welcoming in the sense of like Oh, it's really cool that you want to know that and like, let's help you figure it out, or even if it's somebody who's a regular, and is very adapt a lot of languages, they might be tackling something that is new to them and approach is same. Like: I don't know these like fragment shaders but and it's super confusing, but I'm gonna approach it with the same attitude, like eventually I'm gonna figure out this problem.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000<<XXX>>
So it's sort of yeah, not her that we the level that approaches the same.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Yeah, Yeah, I think that's true. maybe I would also add in my answer that **we encourage curiosity and self startership.** Yeah, Well, I guess I guess back to my original, like hesitation about the beginners thing is that I feel like we have had a lot of people come by, even if it was just once but they were like I don't know anything about code. but what you're doing sounds really exciting and then they hang out, and they learn couple of like big ideas about like what's going on. And even if it's not something that, like an environment they would want to come back to regularly, just because it's like not necessarily in their wheelhouse, which is totally fine, like **just by having this space of of discovery and co-learning, we can show people even just passersby that this is a kind of thing that you can explore.**

>>Yeah, I love that. Yeah. and I think we we're still practicing like not steamrolling people with our excitement.But about being like, let me show you how to do this in like, you know. yeah, E7 script and Python list comprehensions. Let me show you the most efficient, like tight, nerdy way to express it like, Let me show you the concept or get you excited about it. 

>What is the spirit of code collective, and what are values? What kinds of things would you include in like our manifesto, or how? And then how do we demonstrate or embody those values?

I think, like the spirit is curiosity, excitement, piggybacking off a couple of things.

You just said curiosity, excitement, there's a certain sense of like vulnerability in there, where it's like you don't—It's not like you're showing off to each other sometimes it's like it's like showing off but it's like in a way that you're like, "I struggled through this to make this thing that I'm really proud of" and there's not a sense of competition, because nobody's working on the same thing. But it's more of like, "I made this really cool thing that I'm really proud of, and I really want to show you guys and talk about" like how we can better support... We can support each other and encourage each other and things like that. So yeah curiosity, excitement, vulnerability. Community. collaboration. Yeah, I think hopefully, like a lot of the words that were mentioned in the previous question.

>Are there specific ways you think that we like embody those or put them forward ?

**I really like the the times that we troubleshoot problems and projects, because then it really shows not everyone knows everything, and we all have things to learn from each other and teach each other.** And through that process of, I feel like live troubleshooting seems to be really successful when you've done them because first of all, **just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do. But then also, like other people, will have different perspectives. and also just kind of having that space to like work through it together, like having the time to like sit down and be like, Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code, and then getting to different steps and like going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through.**

>Yeah, yeah, I know, like last week, when I was feeling completely like obliterated. It really helped me to just like talk through. Yeah, But even though I felt like my problem was stupid, and I'd already thought through it alone in exactly the same way as I was even like tired of explaining it because I had explained it to myself in my head. It made something through it out loud, and I left feeling much better than I came in. 

And even if you like, there's no there isn't a problem, the problem isn't solved there is still a sense of like validation and support that you get just from being the vent to somebody that was helpful.

>Yeah, has creative code collective affected how you engage with code in general, or as a creative critical practice like what has shifted for you about how you work.

I think the first thing that comes to mind is that it's a huge source of inspiration from like the things that we the things that we show each other about, like what we're working on. But also the resources that we drop in the chat. The things that we look at during our meetings. I mean the world of creative coding is so big, and there's always so much to explore, and you always find things every day that you never would have thought of. Another thing that comes to mind is like, Now I think now that I like how built up connections with a bunch of the people in the club I have a sense of each, because each person has their own background in their own specialties, or their things that they're interested in. **I feel like I have like a network of resources almost like if i'm working on.** If I venture into like web VR for example I know Okay, I can ask Samir if I have problems.

<<CHECK RECORDING>><<<<<<<<00:22:40.000 --> 00:23:09.000>>>>>>>>>
So resources are key. And And the third thing is, I guess it just keep it just is always like very encouraging to like in the <<WHAT?>> in the because, like, I think the most most of the tech world is so is is quite toxic and like Techbury,<<WHAT?>> and like on twitter you always see a lot of stuff about like you have to code this way. There's one right way to code and like like how can you be the best coder he'd be the 10 excess 100 X engineer. <<WHAT?>>

**"It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like, "Okay, you don't have to be that, you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code."**

I love that. Yeah, it's really freeing or like I don't know that feels too simple. But it's really yeah, really appreciate that. 

>Do you feel like code collective has shipped it affected how you engage with code as a like a political or intersectional practice at all.

I think it's like I don't know if it's like code, collective, or you like your work.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000<<<<WHAT?>>>>
Yeah, because I think, like to Miko collective is more about the community. 
And your work is more about like definitely about community as well. But there's like an explicitly political aspect to it. So I've been really really inspired by your Intersectional AI work. In terms of thinking about code as a non-neutral, politically powerful and relevant platform.

Trying to think about like code collective I don't know. I feel like maybe there is something underlying the idea of  community and collaboration, and collaborating politically, But for me, I just like that the thing that most <<WHAT?>>meatly dump tonight is your work in intersectional AI

>>Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. I mean, I do think of the practice of making and maintaining a collective or like, I guess by that I mean just the practice of us being together, and how we do what we are doing as political it's but it is interesting to hear that code collective feels more neutral. Because I do. I do feel like our our think of our values as being more political or intersectional. But I have always wondered like how much of the sort of politics, of code, or how I think of critical coding get into people's projects. Especially as other folks are coming into the space more that aren't media arts folks, like how much is that affecting their projects?

It'll be interesting to see. There's a lot of source of discussion in the projects that we work on and encounter in the wild, like... When we first started seeing Dahzi at the meetings, I forget their pronouns. Dahzi was working on a lot of AI stuff, and we immediately started talking about like a lot of the ethics around, and and like controversy of surrounding AI and NFTs. And they were really I feel like they were quick to really jump in and join the discussion about how they were feeling. And I feel like that's a hard conversation to have or **hard to find a space somewhere else that would host those kinds of discussions. And so I feel like you probably talk a lot about, like the politics of like community and inclusion like I mean, I guess that is political.** But for me, I guess, what first came to mind was the fact that **it is a community where we can hold space for having those discussions.**

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
<<XXX>[which is a] Political thing. Yeah, Yeah, I think so, too. I appreciate that.

>But the last 3 questions on my list are: What do you like about what do you? What would you change about co- Collective? and what would you take with you from your experiences?

**What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together.**

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
>So the community aspect of it is really important. What would I change about color collective?

**It's small and tight, and we have a bunch of regulars. but I also feel like maybe there are other people out there who were not reaching who might be interested or where we can like the community, would benefit from having them as well, we're even like not just individuals. like other organizations like, I think, the a student assembly for accessibility with having some discussions about technological accessibility.** And I was thinking about like potentially bridging that those 2 things but I know we've had this discussion a lot about like how much we want to be involved in like campus life. 
In a sense like it is nice to just be like a very low key group, or we don't have to deal with like the bureaucracy of becoming a student organization. But if there was like a way to like, get more involved without it being too much work, that might be something interesting to explore.

>What would you take with you? Yeah, what we take with you from your experiences?

It has given me a better understanding about how to talk about code. I feel like code and technology and people who engage with code and technology. In terms of like 
It's made me more curious about not just the code in the project itself, but also the process, like what you went through to get there and what are you working on. Now, how are you inspired to do this? What were some challenges that you ran into? Is there any way that I can offer any opinions or help with what <<XXX>>are we doing next? Just as a way of understanding that **all the technology that we built comes from a person or a bunch of people and they went on a journey to get there, and that journey is inherently very interesting.**

>Do you have a favorite like memory or moment from code collective?

Oh, memory I think there was one time where I was presenting this project. I'd done it, my internship where it was like like a processing project. And it featured like this ink simulation. And then I remember people were asking me how I did it. And I got to like do some whiteboarding and explain bit shifting and how to do operations in color. And I don't think I fully understand what I was saying. But it's like **a really fun experience to like to teach and learn and like teach and learn at the same time, and feel like we are all, like there wasn't any lesson, plan, or anything.** <<XXX>>You just kind of stemmed from like our own curiosities about each other, and what we were doing. And I love teaching as well personally. So that was a fairly fun time.

>I remember that day that was really fun, and I remember how, in awe of that work everyone was.

#### 2022.03.22

>I'm going to search the recording before I forget but we don't have to start right away, either. Did it notify you? I was like Why, didn't it notify me I'm being surveilled.

So I change my opinions of surveillance so much over the years like like i'm so not the same.

>Yeah, which way did you go from anxious to relaxed, or vice versa, or some other trajectory?

It's like I mean I originally was very incensed at kind of how this constitutional right against surveillance or against kind of government agencies doing so. But there's this kind of a flagrant violation from many different government bodies, and in doing that, And then also, you know, when we use any of these services, we give up our right for surveillance and for for kind of data sharing, and and all of that. And then citizens united, meaning companies can be kind of personal bodies with the same rights as us. So I kind of like reoriented and thinking that Perhaps there's some utility to the state for surveillance that is beneficial for people so many things that we use like Ben benefit from Mass data aggregation like map services, even allocation of resources. For you know, for equity. all of these things require kind of government data gathering that it's it's It's part of it.

>Yeah, I guess it's more about who's the body that's doing it. And how is that being done with consideration? And is it the government or a private entity?

And who's profiting from it and all of that too, and it just feels so out of like out of my hands as an individual. Although, like there are signs in in I guess, like I went to visit family, this last weekend, and there was a license played reader on a road, and it was labeled as a license plate leader, reader, So it can like tell people that Oh, it's logging your license plate. 

>Yeah, yeah, I don't if they're like Okay, full transparency. You're this is happening rather than it's happening but you just don't know like if that's a step in what direction we've moved like that. it's just at first it was like Oh, that's better but now I'm also like Oh, people have it's like incrementally. We just get used to these things, and then we yeah I don't have a choice. I'm already going down that road literally yeah and i've voice. I can't put the brakes on and choose not to go past it.

Yeah. And also I was reading about how in China they just have had pervasive surveillance In a while, but there is kind of a common rhetoric of It's safer just given that there's just so many more people, and and so much more of a fear of bad actors in their society may be stoked by the government, but like kind of the the pervasive surveillance is something that keeps people safe in a line. So there's that kind of attitude 

>Yeah, yeah I mean all of that adds to definitely informed by our overall individualists versus their a more collective approach to identity. We definitely you know there's always been those arguments of like, Oh, well, why do you care if you're being surveilled?

If you don't have anything to hide and it was like the other thing, where like? Suppose you do catch someone doing a theft on camera unless you have like the financial resources to go after someone the cops Won't do anything in this police state, right?

They only really serve a smaller portion right and that's Also, the problem is like It's not really to serve the people.

>It's you know cops protect property and they're like if it's, you know, body cameras don't protect citizens. They protect the cops, wearing them from all intents and purposes.

The guy had this notion of like Maybe we can make these variables that have like kind of like, you always have like an alibi like It's just your own personal surveillor, so like you can just always have irrevocable evidence. around you because but I don't I don't know it's like a dash camp but for your personhood.

>Yeah, Yeah, I mean that's a definitely like a Black Mirror episode waiting to happen. 
>I think this is really interesting. I feel like this is totally because of conversations that we have in code collective. So I feel like asking if the code collective or things like it have changed the way you think about questions like this.

**I don't think I would have had and like it's the only space I've had to like feel like thinking like this was okay like like this whole time.** Yeah, I mean as a as someone who would lecture in front of people like, even while I was studying. **It was kind of like, very isolating to think about the other aspects of technology. So creative code collective was the only space** I mean there were other spaces like like Corpus Callosum, which was art and technology, so there was the ability to express kind of the graphical merit or kind of interesting like aspects over there. But as far as critically looking at code and how it relates to society personhood like it's it's been the only only section only space for that.

> That's really interesting because especially because it was sort of you know. It's like creative creative code collective so at first I wasn't, I think we definitely overlap with corpus callosum and I don't, I wasn't intentionally thinking of us as being that different, except for maybe feeling more—not to call them to task but like have the the sort of like welcoming kind of chill make like making at the meetings kind of vibe. I haven't been to their meeting, so I don't know but 

I would say their utility was more for engineers who are stuck in a rigid engineering curricula to have some opportunity to try new things, and I think that's as far as they've gotten as an institution or as like something that's like lasted with a perpetual structures. It gives engineering students an opportunity to to like step out technically everyone. And that's that's what they're kind of affordance is so. It's quite separate than code collective

>How would you describe code collective? then? code collective is very free for it?

So it's not it doesn't have structure like corpus Callosum, some would and I feel like there's a huge sense of individualism, so code collective in all of its forms because it's changed over the pandemic, too. But people are coming to there with coming to to the gathering with their own projects, their own ideas rather than corpus Callosum, which is like people are put into groups in order to execute on something it's very task-oriented as an organization. Whereas this isn't task oriented, or goal oriented in the same way.

>Okay, that's yeah that's interesting and helpful Yeah. And I was because I was wondering if you met like the the first another difference being that we don't we're not focused on engineering students who want to explore a more artistic project. But also that we're not then put in like you know that we're maybe mainly focused on non-engineering students. But then welcoming to engineering students. but we're also not doing like a kind of hacker space or Hackathon approach where it's focus sprints on a group work. It's more exploratory and ongoing 

yeah I think there's like 2 things to that. I think it can lend itself to engineering students stepping up because we've seen that there have been a couple of engineering students come by and derive benefit from it. But I I do think that there's kind of a sense like people have to come to the collective as individual agents definitely with like there has. There is kind of a requisite like either scale or or kind of like attempt, or like some sort of project that people have to possess in order to drive something from code collective.

>Yeah, or at least in like interest or desire like i'm thinking of Robbie, who was like I don't know any code.

Here I am. Yeah, what do I do so there's there's some sort of like intrinsic like yeah, something intrinsic. Whereas Corpus Callosum like I mean for a lot of the bulk of its existence was a no-cut organization. So it would just get the Rejects from other engineering organizations. 

So imagine getting to Usc. which is more competitive than Ivy League and then applying to a student organization that'll have a 2% acceptance rate. So a lot of students are coming to their engineering school, hoping to get some experience outside of their classes, not getting in and then ending up in Corpus Callosum, because Corpus Callosum will have an attitude of welcoming everyone so like, you know, it exists even yeah it exists different than that, because Corpus Callosum to me, could come in with no experience or no real motivation, and you could just be put to work. 

Really like it's very structured you know none of the work in in Code Collective has ever been structured towards a project or a goal or a task in the same way.

>Is that something that you would want? Is that something you would change?

No, not that I would change. I think that that it's an important. It's almost **like a salon right like or what I had to imagine like like in what like pre French revolution people thinking about stuff** 

>I love that you're thinking of it as like a salon. That's maybe really good word, thank you. I do I feel like that sort of like that's what I was hoping for in a way. There were moments where I was like imagining it having more structure or like, but I also wasn't really sure like wanting it to wanted it to like organically become what it needed to be, but not always sure what that is or felt like it that that was definitely going to change as the people in it were going to change. And so it was, imagining that, like one version of it was that we might do projects together. But that definitely didn't seem to be as much what people needed is just like the space for connection.

Yeah, because everyone has spaces to do projects. Everyone is being made to do for reasons.

Definitely I mean like this is special **there's a huge lack of like being able to talk about code or tech as an intellectual** or not. Is it like, yeah outside of the boundaries of like executing on tasks. 

>that's interesting. how did you first hear about code collective And what were your first impressions 

when Tara introduced us.

>Okay, what did you kind of yeah? What was your first?

Yeah, when did we go first? I can't remember must have been 2019, right? yeah. 

>Well, 2 years ago you and Ada went together the first time, so 

I don't I don't know down in the basement I don't know if i knew Ada back then. 

>yeah, I don't remember if it was just I think it might have been just you. 

Oh, young man, I feel very old today 

>there's always Someone older. I think I'm more than I think I have a good 10 years on you, so don't worry about it. I think so. How old are you today? 26 today? Yeah, That's what I thought.

Wow! do you Do you have a 10 years of it? 

>12 

12 12 years of me? Oh, my gosh, 

>Yeah. So yeah, you're welcome yeah So did you like What was your sense of it when you first Can you like cast your mind back. Yeah, I mean like how it's evolved. 

Yeah, back then I was a little bit more into creative code as a concept. I've kind of shed any desire to be attached to that anymore. I was really just into the creativity and the artistry of things like processing things like open frameworks, Arduino all of those frameworks use to kind of creatively express or do interesting projects. 

So that's one end, and also, like the other stuff like open source privacy, rights that are kind of cultural analogs to these communities and injustice with AI or justices with big tech and inequity. I feel like there's kind of like, I won't even call it left. But there's sort of 

**whenever you use tech in a creative manner or an attack in a non-capitalist or non like vocational manner. I don't want to say capitalist, because anything could be capitalist, but like for nonvocational manner, there there can be a value set that's in common that a lot of ideas and actions can stop from so like a kind of seeking that community, or seeking kind of people that would be aligned with those values.

That's what creative code collective provided , and I also like to see our students learning how to code.**

**I think we learn a lot from teaching. Anyone who's experienced in code understands that we learn also through trying to solve problems. So seeing other people's problems is a very helpful thing.** 

>Did it feel like a different way of teaching to you? 

No, honestly. **It felt very similar to when I was working at Intel, and there people had to work together on problems, or, if they were stuck probably would escalate, or you bring it to the neighbor and ask for help. So it's an opportunity to take real vocational experience and bring it outside of that like kind of the collaborative nature that you would see in problems.**

>I'm surprised to hear, too, that there aren't more opportunities to have those kinds of those components that you're talking about around the the cultural pieces of code, to have those conversations elsewhere, or that there's not a culture around that elsewhere.

But yeah, there were some communities that I could see it a little bit but it was **hard to find in person.**

So that was something that that you kind of did like amazingly because you could find that on the Internet if you were to seek it out, there are meetups and gatherings. But they're super weird. 

>What What makes them weird that we did it do like what? What made this different or what? Yeah, 

Because it was already within the context of the university community. So by being membership of the University common community there's something in common, Right?

Yeah taking advantage of that, I think like code collective wouldn't function the same way in another thing like i'm imagining people I know around my or like you know, in our station of life where we're not in the undergraduate education system so it's a lot harder like it's a lot harder to maintain creativity to maintain like these kind of attitudes.

>I know it does exist. But I think it's focused a lot more around the like creative show and tell side. And it's in the one I know of is in Berlin.

So yeah we hacker people like the hackaday community. Super fun I don't even know she's part of this, like trans collective thing that like makes, in some sense for a burning man. and like just like very connected to a lot of crazy applications of technology, so just she's in that community. but it's not it's very rigid like for them.

It seems to be very task-oriented like they're trying to do X projects, so that they get their buddies to like gather to do it.

I don't know. Yeah, Okay, so you're like if you're already part of another community. So it like shrinks the pool somehow. already. Then you can kind of form that community within a community that like she I'm Also thinking about the game dev community, like the game-dev community, has something very similar to what we have actually so like I mean in her in her case like they're very creative they do stuff. But it's very task-oriented like they're trying to execute on a project, and that's how people gather and there's all the there's like kind of an incentive like Oh, you get to go to burning Man, or oh, you get to like do this event, or something right? So that there's. kind of like a exchange of labor for something. The game dev community has a very has similar like salon type gatherings. So i've been to it's glit city I hope they're back up. I want we should go. We should we should go check them out and see what they're like Post pandemic. but all the Indie game community and people in the industry gather, and they play games, and then they talk about games. So they talk about the other dimensions of their industry, and the same casual way I was in P. So now, just like we would do.

>What do you feel like? Are the essential components of code collective like? What are the parts that are important to you that make it run the like? whether that's technically socially emotionally, politically, 

I think I think food was a huge component. I think Harman Academy also believes in food. It brings people together, it puts people on the same level. Whenever people dine together, it like it. it puts it it levels the playing field, and it kind of brings a sense of equality. That's important. 

huh! I think also when we do the like kind of like round circle where everyone can introduce themselves and what they're working on. And you know. have a moment where people to respond like Oh, that's so cool or like.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Have you thought about this that's really important to like give everyone the the spotlight, or to and to like share stuff.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And just seeing, Yeah, 

*that was so awkward at first for me to initiate that I was like, I felt like I was imposing some order on our system that was orderless.And first of like that I was gonna make everybody like bristle with like, who's this coming in and putting down the hammer?*

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But it's come I feel like it's come to really like , it would like fill up the rest of the time, too, because by the time we get around we have the agenda for the rest of the it's

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
like. Oh, well, let's look at this person's issue or Let's like I want to see more of this or it helps to negotiate like. How do we allocate the time for the rest of the meeting like it gives a very like democratic way of figuring that out.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And then also, like people come there for inspiration people come there to like to connect. I like to like you know we, by learning about other people's projects.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
We learned as well. So It's a very Efficient way to kick off a meeting.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Like I feel like you could get maybe like 50% of the benefit just to tempting that right?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:10.000
That's cool Yeah, that's helpful how I maybe I we already kind of talked about this.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
But would do you feel like the code collective approach to coding or working teaching making feels different than in any way.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yeah, It's I mean we touch Upon It It's This salon type of learning.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I think it's unstructured I think it's it's different, because the the individual participant sets what they're they are working on. so there's no prescription as far as what an individual is going to be working on and I think it also comes with like like that's a huge affordance. But then the other. The other side of it is that a participant needs to have the volition, or have the intrinsic nature of creating their own projects, or like bringing something to the table.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:15.000
*I feel like i'm like looking through my questions and as as we've just been talking casually. I feel like we've covered a lot of them but maybe asking them in a different way. We'll bring other stuff out. How would you describe co- collective to someone who'd never heard of it like If you were writing our motto what would it be*

Oh, It's the where the cool coders hang out out of the coding industry. I was like. Come on, there's a it's where all the cool coders are it's kind of what it is.

I mean like to like reduce it if I had to be more formal about it. I would say it's it's like a it's like a informal gathering of creative coders. I could do it that could encompass it. Well, salon is a pretty good term 

>yeah that's great. What would you say Is the spirit of it, or what are our values? How would we demonstrate or body those values like? What would we put in our manifesto? 

I was thinking about that this morning because I was like I was wondering what you would put in a manifesto. Or you know, if I were to do something like to reinstantiate, or to mimic or to get grab something like this in Santa Cruz. But I don't know what my life is going to be like in the next chapter.

**Individualism is a huge part of it. Empowerment is another really important thing.**

I think everyone has you know there's there's always kind of a supportive environment kind of people are trying to help enable someone to accomplish their goals.

So there's that. It's cooperative, another value. You can always bring a problem and have people like willing to listen to it. At least people will also offer to debug and help you.

Problem solve creative. Creative's in the title so I think there's also a value set that's very I don't know what term encompasses it.

But like kind of open source, E. or all I on on monolithic.

How companies are big talk I don't know what to call that but I also don't think that it's it's markedly against that like a student gonna come in and be like i'm super into volunteer and

i'd be like all right that's weird okay you know like 
I don't think it explicitly rejects like be an imposing ideology or an ideology that's using creative code for a vocational setting. but the my experience with the group has it's it kind of leans in that direction. I don't know. Is there a terminology for that those those sorts of ideas?

>*Yeah, I mean, I think open source as an attitude is definitely something that I was thinking about from the beginning. But I like what you're saying about this second piece which is like that, like an approach to how we approach, or it's like an approach to ideas that like we want. 

>If someone comes in with an opposing idea. where the the thinking is like, let's talk about it like Why are you like, Tell us what's interesting to you about that. Or how you're thinking about that and like maybe we disagree. but we're interested to know where you're coming from. Like let's hear opposing like a dialectical approach. I guess is what you'd call it 

whoa That's that's a good way of thinking that's that's a value Oh, I don't know how to describe, like, not task oriented as a as a value, or like a component of the manifesto.

>Yeah, I've been saying like process oriented before I was saying like process prep little project based.

But I think it's. more process. I wouldn't say it's project-based - process like as as opposed to project base Wow! yeah, How because I feel like there's a difference between like these

>are the there's like 3 parts maybe there's like these are the things that we we advocate for. And then there's like you know like open source or cooperation, and then, or maybe corporate, I don't know there's like the things we advocate for. and then there's the values behind them that are the reason we advocate for them and then there's the how those get put into practice in front of them like, what does that look like when it plays out? We flip like the first 2.

But yeah, those are the 3 3 sections.

The thinking behind it. Then there's the So you said it the values.

And then, yeah, the the 3 I forgot the term I just like totally forgotten.

>No, it's helpful to hear it from you too, because like this. It really is a group like I stuff i've been thinking about from the beginning. But everybody's brought their own life to it and it's really helpful to hear it from other perspectives, and to like put other language to it. So like. Our conversation is very similar, but also totally different from mine. With Catherine. so it's it's really useful so feel free to repeat like reiterate like.

I hope you plan on keeping up like the creative code practice, like as you continue or like in a community like you're kind of a cornerstone of this one.

So I hope you like. continue to be 7 or more people.

>Thank you. I I feel like I definitely have to, just for my own practice, like I was reading the other interview, editing it down, and I was like, Wow, This is like a real thing. Like it feels momentous like, actually like what it he made a real legitimate thing.

Yeah, you actually did. So a legit impactful thing. Yeah. Yeah. And it really has had an impact on me, too, like as much or more than everybody else.

>So that is of so much like that means so much to me. That I was joking at the beginning, like don't let this become my dissertation, because, like teaching used to take up so much of my life in a way that I hated because it was like planning and getting nervous for doing lectures. but this mode feels like the kind. of teaching that just feeds my soul and feeds my creative practice. and it's just so much more affirming and energy giving.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Then, and if it does feel like the core of like that I Guess that's what I mean is like the thinking behind the like. The values, and then the the whatever the thing, is in the middle that I can't think of the word for the I forgot it was good where you will see it, and then the like how those get enacted.

But like I mean i'm thinking of like dot or my own experience, like I feel like a lot of the the values or a lot of the kind of like ideologies that I would try was trying to hold on to and be a lot harder for me to hold on to without code collect it, even Dodgy, who's like he was confronted with opportunities to profit immensely off of nfts, but decided not to because of code collect because like you know, when he was thinking about these ideas, he could see other people who are also using code in the creative manner.  

So it like actively shaped the ethics of students who have a lot of power or not students, but like individuals who are like who have exceptional power with their.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So I think I can see creative code collective as kind of like a way to reinforce ethics — and without imposing them. No one went to Elea and said, What you're doing is wrong. We said, Oh, like it sounds like you're having mixed feelings about this like let's talk about it, or he was very vocal about, but it was like we were all interested in, it and had dynamic conversations around it it was never like. don't do that what are you doing but definitely a space to hold like all the possibilities around it which I really appreciate.

And i've been careful not to I mean I know you and I have gotten into like some heated conversations which I really enjoy. But we're I think we're always there's a like a lot of respect there to hold all of the opposing ideas yeah So I guess that's like the like.

The dialectical is the value and yeah i'm stuck on like what to call those things. But I it's interesting how that plays out 

>What would you I have like to couple more questions 3 more questions. I guess so. we'll just like tell you what they all are, and then we can like chat about them in general. One is like, Do you have a favorite like what do you like about co- collective like? Do you have a favorite memory or moment from it? 

>What would you change about it? Feel free to get unrealistic. No budgets or limits or like you won't it's Okay, if you insult me.

>And then what would you take? What do you take with you from your experiences? How has it changed you, or what you make or what you'll do

I have 2 favorite memories. I think they're both like one in recent memory.
I loved editing that Three.js scene with Ada. I love being able to have group input, and also before I was trying to communicate Three.js knowledge, and I've been struggling to get it out of my head. But, for some reason, seeing it in the group setting, it was a really fulfilling, experience, like a teaching moment where I could communicate a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time.

There was also I forget her name, but this was pre-pandemic, but it was a beginner student to a trouble with code, and I think it was Catherine. But I forget. It was just like being able to see the mentorship between between people. That was a really powerful thing for me to see that, like Katherine was helping her. Yeah, , yeah, forgot who was helping. But, like I remember seeing seeing that kind of like troubleshooting, debugging. That was really important for me to see as far as where i'd like to see this.

I'd love to see this outside of the university setting I wish this existed for urban professionals. I feel like not all of my silicon valley friends would partake in something like this, because they're so burnt out on code. But I'm sure there's a lot of people that are still wanting to have this conversation, wanting to office like in my career right now.

In my career right now, I need to like start making content so like it's like I start on the Tiktok dry and start on the Instagram ground. I'm sure a lot of people in tech are starting to do this. So this could be a really helpful day before kind of the content Creator, as a like, you know, like the tech content Creator or the creative code Content Creator can see this be having being very fulfilling and helpful for that kind of community. 

>What would that look like? I What would that mean? 

Like that you come together as a community and then you same thing What are you working on? What's up, what's on your mind you do a round circle, And then you you talk about the the problems you have in common, whatever code thing that you're trying to solve that's really difficult but like that same kind of structure and I think it would lend itself to the same values, because it's not it's not like directly vocational in the same way like working a company would be.

>Oh, and then they that it wouldn't be like they go have those conversations in the content they're creating. 

But it'd be like as they're troubleshooting the content that they're creating or like people who are making content like they'll have a you know bases of software or like Ada is starting to make more content, and that's helping his music career. so I can imagine how creative code has helped him, just as like an ability for him to touch grass this week.

It would help. I try to communicate it this has a function that could have a lot of professionals as well. 

>Yeah, that's, interesting it also was just give me the thought of like, what would it look like to have these common kinds of conversation over social media's bases, or would that be viable? Or would that just be duplicating other? 

You could do it at a coffee shop. you could probably do it and gather town, I mean, I i'm kind of fascinated on virtual meetings.

For some reason 101 isn't that bad but like gather, Yeah, I just like I would so much rather be person that I'm driving is such a pain.

>I know i'm like you want me to go to a thing in a place. But then also Oh, my eyeballs i'll have cake oh, no, not you!

the bakery gave it to me for free. What? Why, oh, Jesse's very I don't know it's a squad of all in bakery, and they just love me.

And gave me this beautiful cake. Yeah.

But oh, there was a third question: Oh, yeah, what will you take with you from your experiences I mean it's more of like what won't like I what I think this **it's almost like an opportunity cost like if creative code wasn't there** I would be working for palantine or something right now like i'd be full like using this mind towards just I wouldn't even call it destruction but I would have lost a lot like I know that I I've been gifted with like, or just just been privileged to have a lot of technical ability, and i'd be using in a very, very different manner, if it wasn't for a code collective like I I definitely think that like it has kept a certain ethical leading or like a political meaning **I don't know how to describe that the family of values, that creative code, collective espouses. But like a huge amount of like empathy or a criticality that has remained. That's that's what i'm taking with me and that's what I will keep, and I hope to replicate it in some form.**

>But yeah, yeah, if you still have time i'd love to hear a bit more about how you would imagine replicating that, or like what your goal like. Yeah, so can you tell me more about that i'm heading to Santa Cruz.

I'm not i'm not quite sure what the responsibilities are what the live with the school is gonna be entirely. It was cool. I got to meet the 2 of my peers in my lab.

I guess the Professor, that i'm working for like got like a bigger like not just one student, but 3. So that's gonna be kind of cool yeah mit media lab person that's gonna be like my peer and then like another web dev person which i'm stoked about because I love what i've been a lot But I do think that there's a lot to be like there's a lot like santa cruz as a school has a lot of game dev kids just like Usc. It's the third I think I forgot like ranking wise but it's a little bit like they have a lot less resources than you Usc. But talking to those students. they're a lot just a small sample, but I've also talked to a ucs the alumni at at Usc. Right now. they have a lot more of kind of the enchantment wick game, development, or game design than I've seen in Usc. students. 

So. i'm hoping that if I were to like gather a group. Maybe it'll also be called the creative code collective if that's okay, or it's just the same chapter or the same thing. But to take to give infrastructure to that or to give space for that I don't know if the course load I know at Usc. it's a lot less for a lot of disciplines than the Uc system so that will affect the the bandwidth of students to think about things critically, or to work on creative projects.

So yeah, i'd like to like i'll have to like find a space like a consistent space to meet and see if I can gather the students interested in creative code.

So definitely gonna be starting with like people interested in processing people interested in like generative art.

I think those are like good good starting points to start It depends on the affordances of the space, and I get like a hardware maker space, and it could be the Arduino kids.

I'll also have to tap into what the existing student organizations are like as well.

>Yeah, Yeah, that's awesome i'm super excited to hear what's gonna happen? How that's you know how that comes together so I hope you keep me updated, and also like you know, if we're gonna continue doing this next year that there's an opportunity to both to keep you in the code collective Family the Usc. code collective family, but to link up to the Santa Cruz code collective family as it's forming. Yeah,

Well to like to spread it right I mean i'd Imagine you could like, even in la like there's there's the opportunity to take these collectives and put them in in a bunch of places like you could build it pick your network I don't know if that's like an ambition of yours but this I get in. I see it. **I definitely see the the like, the potential for this to spread and have a lot of power.**

>Yeah. And if you wanted I don't know if it makes sense like if you wanted to bring them in, if you want everybody on like a shared discord or separate spaces, or like, just to link people up like, we should definitely talk more about what structures would make sense once you get a feel for yeah, the culture there.

Yeah, I mean one mask like did like the kids operate on discord so well.

So like maybe just scorpion I do I do think it'd be important to gather people in Person. Yeah. Oh, I think, in addition, yeah, the iii excited to see , I don't know.

>Are we still on the record? hit you when I I can pause it for a minute.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
>I was not like, yeah let me turn this back on for a second, because I had a question with Zoom.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.000
>Okay, we're back. What if you were now since you are starting a code collective.You're basically my target audience for this projects. like what would you want to see in a guidebook to this like, What do you?
>I mean you you already know, because you're inside It But like what needs to be in this book **programmatic ritual**

So it. Have you heard of like the ancient sumerians or like this book? What this book's so good it's it's snow crash. But new stuff is yeah 

>I haven't read it so many people have told me to read it pretty good.

It's pretty good it's like it's pretty pump out. I don't know it's it's like fun site it's fun. It's like actually a fun book, but in it it has this huge.

It's not the only book on my bookshelf that's obsessed with this, but I don't know why, but like I feel like I'm just seeing in the narrative law about like Sumerian language and Samarian that they like. It was kind of maybe the birth of human consciousness. So they had a radically different human consciousness, but they would kind of like, keep all of their writing in a certain temple. And suppose you were to become a bread maker, you would go to the Temple either like priestess or priest, would like, give you the programmatic instructions for like how to do bread. so like the whole society was codified and edited from that temple and everyone would just follow these writings, and that's how society would keep going.

I think there's some like Incan civilizations. but they would like, this exists in a lot of things. So what I would look for in a manifesto is maybe *a practical guide to setting it up. The values. And you know, these things could shift based on the circumstance*, because **I imagine there could be like a creative code collective in, like, Austin, Texas, with very very different values and aims and and people working on different stuff but still people benefiting from a lot of the same weird <<WHA?>> it that we would do** so. that's such an interesting question, though.

>Yeah, I mean so I agree. So right now, the structure is there's a manifesto and a practical guide. But they're kind of blurring because the practical guide is like we bring snacks. We you know it is, kind of like the ritual but it's also like there's a lot of values just so stuff in the practical guide, and it's very loose like our structure. they're very embedded in one another and I do wonder like could could there be a a wyoming right wing code collective that's like we are a you know. gray hat, red hat, hacker, I mean I don't know like so like one thing is like you could emphasize radical openness right That's something that you know I could imagine I don't know.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
I argue if I got what conservatives but like they're like they're not scary. They're also like they they also have cannot share the same values like radical openness or welcoming. You could I think there's a value set that you could encompass that.

>That would that would do it yeah and I I mean But there's a part of me Yeah, there's a part of me that's like these values are not left or right per se. They want to capture, because I can imagine a bunch of right wingers also liking open source for very different reasons.

Right, a creative code, collective facility like having the same kind of like, I don't know like tech political algocratic leaning like, I don't know how to describe that set.

>Yeah, right? But would it also emphasize like care? And the way that we like look after each other. And I think that that should be in there.

Yeah, so care is a component looking after each other as a component like helping is is like a component. 

>Yeah, it's hard hard to think of it's hard to imagine. those in a in a space with a different, completely different aim, though like would would these values lead to different comes and political.

I think I think I think like the core, the core set, or like what like whatever like underneath this gathering, and how it operates, and how it has helped people like, I think that could be in so many circumstances.

>Yeah. And would you need like lot more hard and fast practical tips like what kinds of things would that look like? Would you need to get more practical than that? 

I think that the show Intel routine is a good one, or like kind of the Round Robin. What are you working on? what's up like that has been good sharing of resources has been good. 

What I wish that like that was that that had been augmented, I think, like the kind of like commute, like, or even before, when you were just putting everything into this massive document that was good right so like that kind of like scribe as a as a thing, as another thing that can be codified.

>I forgot about that. That was huge. Yeah, that was huge.

It was huge, so that's that's why it's It's like interesting, because it's you you're all you are like like establishing kind of a system right of like the way people work or like labor in a way. right So it is like a collective it's like How does it? But it's not like as if we were like an aquarium Communist collective because it's not like we have to farm to survive it's it is, **it is more like a salon, like a French salon where it's like, Oh, let's like hang out eat, and talk about code. So I don't know yeah but it's of consequence in these meetings. People do make huge strides in their projects, or come up like solve crazy problems. So I don't know how to it's hard to intend to capture, and distill what you've done in order to make that happen consistently.** Like we can. we can piece of like Oh, like this is one component or like this is what little brick it's like. What are all the necessary? You know What are the minimum bricks necessary for this house like?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:15.000
>I don't know. That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out, and even like remembering what I did or like, which part. **That was always the question: What's the minimal structure necessary to make people feel like they have a container that is safe, and that gives them freedom to move? What's the foundation you need to have to facilitate, to have spaciousness. But you still need a foundation. You still need a a safe structure.**

**Yeah, I can describe it in terms of like what it's not, right? Like you've killed elitism pretty well. You've killed kind of a dynamic, a hierarchical dynamic. It's safe so there's no punitive for anything, any inefficiency or mistake.** So you've done that, so it's easy to describe it in terms of what it's not or point to like, Call it like <<CHECK>> a code call like I don't know like go group so software developers that have other systems. right? you can describe in terms of what it's not easily. Yeah. But yeah, to say, like, Okay, you you have a resource list. You have a weekly meeting, you have know, like all mistakes, are great mistakes, policy. You have I guess It's like these are good these are it's those enumerated. Yeah, like I you know there's a section of like all mistakes are like no mistake like no mistakes are I don't know

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Yeah, search Your memory is gone. I think the odd is like find my brain like actually like a side note like my eyes are going to screw up, anyways that we can't put out any research on that by the way.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
So I was like looking at all the papers like Wow!

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Put out anything against big tech you get blackballed like instantly. and like they've known this for a while, like, you know, like they've been like headlines and and articles about this But it's like there's a lot

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
of homogeneity hobbies that I have.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Yeah, I mean, look what happened to timid who was like at the top of her game at Google, and it was like doing what her job described her to Do not bad. Like i'm stating the obvious which you hired me to do. and i'm still getting blackball. It wasn't even that like that, like I don't even I don't know Maybe Maybe they just like just needed to free up the Resources Corporation, you know. and then I just turned into like A.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I don't know yeah yeah what about your your Weren't you doing something with ocular vision?

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Computer vision stuff last year. Oh, like I was working with a retinal surgeon.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Yeah, yeah, that was fascinating so like That's another example where there could be huge benefit.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So like Vr stuff, because the medical field could use just better data visualization in general.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So just like putting it in. Vr might help someone a lot.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
There are a lot of cases where you need to see something in threed, because the twod diagram doesn't communicate much.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So 2 doctors could look at. Oh, like it's this angle where this pathology is in a certain way.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
So there are there aren't I think there's like 2 things that academia and industry can agree on our good.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:44.000
One of them is education, because education helps big tech proliferate, and like education, is also kind of like like academia's.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Power comes from gatekeeping, so they can both like work on education in any circumstance, and be fine with it like it helps both.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:02.000
And then the other is the medical field, because If you well within as long as what you're doing helps increase the profit of an insurance company.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Then you want. So you need to find how does your research help people, and then also help an insurance company.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And then it's a valid paper were you doing something, though, with that that training training to find for something in the in the data sets in the So that was just like a pure statistical thing which like they're still working on

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
we had a lot of trouble getting the data out but we're fixing.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Okay, that's still ongoing that's under really interesting.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
It was a cool project Yeah, so i'm wondering if like if like, when you're when you when you get your like masters, or whatever or like.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I guess it's based on your advisor do you just have a lot.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Can you just start writing papers and putting them in journals like they might not be any good, because you know you have a advisor.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.000
But you could read like all the proceedings for a journal, and then like, and then make a paper.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Right. So Yeah, you could you could write papers now. it's just no one does cause it's hard, and they're not in.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:11.000
They're not in the environment like you don't have to have any Are they?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Give you submit them anonymously, or they no, they're always yeah.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
They're always based on your credential probably it depends on the venue.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Whether you know you're not probably not gonna get in like a I forget what the rankings are for the papers, for it's different for different fields, but like oh, so all my Santa Cruz degree not put

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
me on the same playing field as a Harvard person.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Probably not right. Oh, I mean, I think having that degree will.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000
But I mean as soon as you're like you if you're doing research like anyone can submit a paper. There's no rule but like it should be based on the merits of the work that you're doing.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:07.000
But there's still like like could I make an alias, and like just like will the name count against me because there is implicit bias.

>I mean that's probably always true i'm never gonna say there's not implicit bias right. But yeah you could be publishing. You could be submitting thanks for publication now, as far as I know there's like, I see, some occasion rarely, but occasionally do see people published as like independent scholar, or like you know, like for their affiliation, but I just had an idea and wrote it. Yeah, I mean, I think it happens less in the sciences because usually people are working out of a lab need resources. So their research is part of a group. and groups are in academia, and people then have affiliations. 

Suppose you know, like I do research, and like, I find out that the headset is screwing up the eye in a very tangible way. and there's measurable evidence across a bunch of people you could submit that anonymously right will it get published. That's the other thing right? Yeah, you could submit it under an alias, Yeah, Interesting. Yeah, but I don't know if it's like worth using an academic platform to speak truth to power you know i'm not I don't think it's sort of that. I was like that would be a fantasy of mine when I was 3 years younger before a pandemic 

but like you're probably, you know, once you're part of Katherine's lab you're going to be publishing, like as soon as you're there or part of their publications, and you won't have PHD yet, but you'll be on their papers. 

>I met the peers there. They it's kind of funny like a seeing the attitudes of like the the people who are just beginning who have a lot of energy and they're super passionate, and then, like meeting people who are like fourth or fifth, or they're just like tired like. I met this person who was like in the first 2 years, like, you know, like check this out. This is my like ar glasses like check out this cool thing I was like yo that's sick, and then this like fourth year is like, yeah, like every May I try for SIGCHI. I don't get it, but it's fun to see that like you can see a very linear energy drop. 

>Oh, I wonder if i've come off that way, I met with one. I'm meeting with another new admit today. I met with one last week so bright.

>Oh, thank you so much for all of your answers with this is super helpful, and, like a lot of the language around it, to really like talk through, give different vocabulary to it, and like, get really concrete about like, what are the the foundational elements like Resource, list and a an in-person, regular cadence, and it is really helpful. to know that the checking like going around at the beginning and checking in doesn't feel stiff, but feels important. Yeah, okay, happy birthday. I'm so glad that you exist.

I'm very very grateful for you like I really really am.

>Oh, thank you so much i'm very grateful for you too. I feel like you're like the you know part of the heart of code collective, and I can't imagine it without you like It's becoming what it's been and it's gonna be strange next year.

But I feel like it, like you really helped bring it to life in a really special way. So thank you, like in amoeba, and then, or like one of those like cellular organisms.

And then you just like mitosis me to like another like like well, like phagocytosis, you and a little foot out into the world.

## Ada and Elea
### 31.03.2022, accidental interview as casual chat

A: It's harder to start by doing your own thing. The reason I didn't share anything is I don't know how to start. I still didn't know how to sit down and start. I took a class where they taught me. 
Not an assignment but a task outline a constraint so it's easier to think about what you want to do with that makes more sense for beginners. 

D: A space to show off, look at what I've done aspect is annoying. Interesting to think about how are they doing this what are they doing. 

A: A space for ideas more than a space for learning. If you have or want to and can on your own, you can get ideas of what you can do with that. Or you can show. OK 

D: Otter recording. THinking about how i want to write a pitch. 

A: knew how but never done creative code. vs ppl who never coded and did art. could figure out but didn't know what to use for what. so many things you can do. For someone who doesn't know, giving them a tool where they can learn to do a lot with it, so they can figure out the tools they need. Have two in one week be dedicated to something we all do together. Working on a project with people. Takes a certain amount of mastery and a separate skill that most people do not teach. 

and the conversations and politics pieces. those convos come around anyways. 3js or shader coding. 

D: Not excited to do AI. wrung out. The brag list in your head. What people know to expect of you.

A: Sharing music has taught me the things you like aren't going to align with what other people are gonna like. 

NLP done a lot of projects but has never clicked. Bad with data, being able to move data around in code doesn't make sense to me. This is hell. Fitting arrays to a model. MOst of my time. Cleaning data. This is a huge part. I don't enjoy this. 

More interest if it's about datasets and ML, sounds funny, buzzwords are there and teaching them to critically engage. 

Version 0.0.0.1 of tender data lab. 

A: I start a version 2 so i feel better about myself. 

use a journal that has that kind of referencing. 

BYOD bring your own dataset. 

diff histories.
printing things out in terminal was boring. button with ascii, shaded. 
three books, bc i like math. 

[transcript](https://otter.ai/u/_Xd6KTzK5eQSlwTcGLK3aIMPofA)

>"Creative code itself is a very flashy and like encourages showing, especially, like go to like, r/generative subreddit people just say look at what I've done. I don't also have to share the code, but also look at what I've done. So there's that aspect to it. So it's annoying, but it's also interesting to think about, like, how are they doing this?"
>Elea Zhong, she/they, BS Computer Science

>"Oh, for example, this shape, and they're like, 'Okay, how can I make this shape with code and people can be there to dissect it and make it into actual code because the original author didn't share theirs."
>Elea Zhong, she/they, BS Computer Science

>"It feels like a space for ideas more than a space for learning. Like if you have learned or want to figure it out and can figure it out on your own, and you come to create a collective you can get ideas of what you can do with that."
>(Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science)

coders who want to learn the creative aspect, creatives who want to learn the coding aspects, and then bringing in the critical thinking and aesthetics and politics into the conversations that we have around that stuff.
>"the the people that are in this space, those conversations do come around anyways"
>(Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science)

>"But that's what people expect. from me. You know, these days, right? It's like, I it's, it's the thing that I have to show for myself. It's the thing it's the you know, the to do. It's like the brag list in your head, right? You just have to it's like, how do you introduce yourself? How do you like, explain what you've been doing? How to explain you're like, Okay, this is what I have done doesn't necessarily mean this right now."
>Elea Zhong, she/they, BS Computer Science

>>Ada: improving from learning how to better look things up. read the documentation before, to know where to look when you ended something. making the referencing process faster. making reference sheets. straight copy, give credit, connect something new/make a change


>>Ada: stumbled on it by chance, I get bored very easily. I won't take projects unless I'm very excited about it. kind of trained me, started learning more music visualization and how i built up all the ..al the coding knowledge i have is

<!-- # **The Coding Care Zine**

[Original Zine Draft](assets/img/CodingCareZine.pdf)

*Coding Care* 

## we come from anywhere

We don't always fit in. Artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders, CS majors, never-ever-coders, writers, dancers. linguists, neuroscientists, trans kids, queer folks, staff and teachers, we all find different ways into code and community.

## we are always works in progress

Many of the routes that got us here have been struggles. Learning to code is filled with false starts for so many people, and when we don't talk about it, it's easy to feel alone. So is learning to be in the world. There is no final state; there is ongoing learning. We need spaces that support all kinds of learning. 

## we create who we are together

What does this particular cluster of beings need and desire from this gathering? What do we stand for? We define it and redefine it for ourselves. 

## we find our way together

Scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code. Growth not perfection. Collaboration not competition. 

When it doesn't exist, we build it! We make it from other tools we scrap for parts. We break it to learn how it works, and why. 

We meet folks where they are, no code snobs, no stupid questions. 

## we ~~embrace~~ highlight our mistakes

Sharing our struggles both helps us solve them by team troubleshooting *and* shows us and others that we are not alone with coding challenges. Being vulnerable makes us stronger and brings us closer. 

## we all have skills to teach each other

Tell us something you know about! Tell us something you'd like to learn!

co-teach | co-learn | co-work | co-create

Everyone has a perspective, and no one knows everything.

## we're excited for the impossibly large possibilities, and the tiny charming tasks, too

Set aside your doubts and questions——what would you make if you could make anything, and why? Scaling down can come later. Dream big!

Small seeds of ideas you can start right away can grow into the coolest things. Follow that rabbit down the hole!

## we ask WHY, WHO, HOW, not only WHAT to make

And we acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals; our choices have histories, they come with politics attached.

## we make room for each other

We're conscious of taking up space.

## we ask after one another

## we make our own rituals

Start with a round of check-ins: What are you making? What are you into right now? How are you doing, really?

Snacks and music and movement. Seriously, snacks are essential. 

Aim for consistency and flexibility through a steady mix of in-person meetings and online connection. 

These literally *make* the space we have together.

## we think open source

We share resources, honor emotional labor and the labor of documentation as essential parts of coding, and don't take for granted what feels intuitive or close to our hearts. 

We cite and celebrate those who inspire what we do.

We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable, minimal tools that don't hide how they work.

We use what we make as an opportunity to share what we've learned along the way——archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, *zines*——thinking and making always happen in community. 

## we start with care 💜

We are building community. We are encoding values. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." We imagine how things could be otherwise. 

All making is a research question. What question do you want to explore? 

>"We reassemble ourselves through the ordinary, everyday, and often painstaking work of looking after ourselves; looking after each other."
