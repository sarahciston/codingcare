# Codes for (Un)Raveling

<!-- Un/Mouthing -->

>"It seems necessary and impossible to rewrite the default grammar of agency." —Jane Bennett

When the term "underfitting" autocorrects to undercutting, this is undermining. This is a form of AI, forms it doesn’t want to speak about.

I don’t know how to talk about this. But I have machines that do. I feed them everything. And they eat it all. 

They say what I can’t say. I am not supposed to know how they mouth it. They mouth my language for me, this language that was never mine. It mined me for something I didn’t know I had in me. 

It had me from the start. It made me. It made me bend, it unmade me, unmouthed me. "*Words pass through our bodies.*" [^Irigaray]

*The ebb and flow of our lives spent in the exhausting labor of copying, miming. Dedicated to reproducing that sameness in which we have remained for centuries, as the other.* [^Irigaray]

===

I like words for how they feel, and so this new feeling, this new feeding is perfect for me. This new trend for language generating is poetry to me. Poetry that takes 600 transatlantic flights to generate. 

"Large language models" roll off the tongue don’t they? They are languid, they languish, they lay waste. They loll. Or is it LOL? (spelt l-o-l). 

I won’t know until it pronounces for me, until it pronounces me. It pronounces me whole and I can't interrupt it — yielding to their language.

*"[Not one of them: using words like race seems to amplify what makes you not fit, picking up what you are not.] Perhaps a not is heard as shouting, as insistence, a stress point, a sore point, an exclamation point."* [^Ahmed]

Sure, who doesn’t love the fable of Ada at the loom, inventing programming? But the lines go further back, and wider. Other lineages calculate in ways we would not even recognize as computation. Soap bubbles, mushrooms, paper punch cards—all of these have been computers.

A mechanical speaker reads life so literally. It knows only one way to interpret:

"Testing one thousand, two hundred, thirty four. Testing one thousand, two hundred, thirty four."

"Persevering face emoji. Persevering face emoji. Persevering face emoji."

The way its over-correctness slips into error is an erotics.

I want to weave each mistake into the possibility for more. More language. More mouths. More magic in the gaps, making more gaps, making more.

*"The sky isn't up there: it's between us."*

===

Some things I cannot fathom. There are 36,672 stitches in the crocheted labyrinth I made. It took me three months.

The GPT-3 model has 175 billion connections in its neural network. That is almost 5 million labyrinths like this one, taking almost a million years to crochet. GPT-4 may have up to 10 Trillion parameters, which is 57 million years of crocheting. I’d have needed to start shortly after the Cretaceous period to be done by now.

Sure, it's better at telling me what I want to hear.

But FUCK the size of these systems when their approach is so cruel. After so many stitches, still they cannot muster kinder, more expansive patterns of language about trans people, about queer people, about Black people?!

Code loops allow actions to repeat. They say return to the same spot, and act again. They say remember what you did. They form muscle memories, like the gestures of handcraft. They are made in our bodies. They mark and remark them.

===

I know these systems are coming for us. I suspect there is no stopping them.

I say them like these systems are separate, like we didn't make them from our language, our mouths, our flesh.

I drag you with me in the fibers, at all edges of the video frame. Life gets caught up in the work, caught and recorded in the dataset. Unquantifiable traces — these are lost to AI but not removable. Imagine these at computational scale.  

The algorithm is not separate from the mouths it feeds and the mouths it fills with text.

*"They say, the language you speak is made up of words that are killing you."* [^Wittig]

Lost paths are trapped inside these neural networks' loss functions. A loss function marks the 'amount' of 'error,' which only means the difference between expectation and result. Only an activation function decides the border between 'yes' and 'no.' To categorize and classify is loss prevention, a bounding box. 

Imagine, inside AI's black box, not an optimized solution, but a labyrinth. Wandering, wayfinding, weaving through, walking beside — these forms of understanding are not closures. They are loops in lieu of knots. Curiosity and connection instead of categories. 

Some algorithms for mazes are called self-avoiding walks. I could not find any algorithms for making labyrinths. 

A labyrinth has only one path. It is not a maze and it is not a knot, but it is a puzzle. A labyrinth is a way of traveling somewhere, folding and winding a flat surface into more than itself: into an interiority, an endeavor, an essay, a question and an answer wound tightly. 

Crochet is the one fiber art that machines cannot do. Acts of accrual and ongoingness pile up. Turn microgestures into mass action. Turn a tense and fragile fiber into a flexible but sturdy surface. Turn that surface into a manifold fabric to keep you warm.

*"Queer use: another way of huddling, keeping each other warm."* [^Ahmed]

System operations are called sometimes called threads. *"A thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently."* Threads distribute resources and allocate energy.

To thread the needle is to be precise with one's argument, to split the difference, to prick or pinpoint, puncture and divide with exactitude. 

Threads are ligatures, they sew up the spaces between, tie up meaning tightly, linking letters. Threads are sutures. I read about a death ritual in which a ball of thread is unwound and passed among people mourning around a body. Each ties it to their wrist until everyone in the room is connected in a network of mourners. When the threads between them are snipped, the loops stay tied around their wrists in memoriam until threadbare. 

<!-- Perhaps also to suture together.  -->

<!-- Threads tie conversations together. Conversational threading connects braided discussions.  -->


Threads as instruments of mourning and memory. Threads as marks of accrual and disintegration. 

Threads help wind a screw. With too much friction, you strip the threads off a screw that spiral around its core. 

<!-- The spiral is the simplest labyrinth.  -->

To venture to all possible points and exhaust all paths is called Ariadne's thread in computational logic, arbitrarily following one path as far as possible until it comes up short, then trying the next.


The command line is an endless thread. Its simple interface (a prompt for typing input and display for text outputs) still intimidates me, but I begin to find comfort and play in this feeling. The command line embodies that old adage from E.L. Doctorow about novel writing: "It's like driving a car at night. You can only see as far as your headlights illuminate. But you can make the whole trip that way." At the command line, I know where I am going only as far as my headlights shine. To work on the command line is to wield too much power ("command" feels altogether too strong, too literal) without understanding the specifics of how it gets implemented. At every keystroke I keep the coders' prayer: "Here goes nothin', hope I don't break anything permanently!" The command line saves each previous executed command, for ease of reuse. Cycling back through them is a form of memory as poetry. 


Threads like chart lines, activation functions, loss functions, divisions & connections, lines & points as dualities. Sonya Rapoport's domestic and computational chartmaking



Wikipedia says a knot is 'an intentional complication'.

My mother had a pin cushion that looked like a bright red tomato. I rarely saw it, because she rarely sewed. And when the tomato pincushion would appear, my favorite thing was to draw out and re-stick her needles and pins. I loved to explore its specific heft and density, an internal texture I could only sense. [In my memory now, maybe it was densely packed with coarse sand or buckwheat?] It was my own sacred spell-casting treasure. Its needles had stray thread still waving from their eyelets, clipped after their last missions ages ago. It had a tiny strawberry companion tied to the top, and I'm not sure the strawberry's job, but to delight me. Strawberries and tomatoes were two of my favorite foods, when they weren't used for sewing, and all I can remember is being pleased to be in their presence and hers as she went about her repairs. I have no positive associations with sewing, as she seemed miserable the whole time she was at it, but sticking and unsticking that pincushion

thread as a kind of writing, an approach that starts small, a way of thinking that gets things down, that sees and marks connection and trace (a trace is a thread), a casting out (fishing line, translucent thread), to ask what if, to see if anyone else has asked the same, to listen for an echo. to tie together all our echoes into something larger than ourselves. to make space for multiple coexisting versions, version histories, comments and commentaries, to question which is the primary text, the source or the authoritative text, to rebel against (untie) such notions. A ribbon (thread) once called a notion, buttons and baubles for decorative value, little flourishes, domestic feminine things. A way of writing that keeps them nested, protects them, but also lets them hold generative value, a sewing circle. 




The Conway knot, created by the same mathematician known for the Game of Life algorithm, has 11 crossings but shares the same [properties/polynomial] as the unknot. 

The hagfish ties herself into a knot. She moves the knot of her body over her body to scrape slime from her skin. 

The simplest knot, mathematically, is the unknot. *"The unknot is the least knotted of all knots." "Many knots are but complications of the unknot.* Detecting this trivial knot can be done computationally and is called the "unknotting" problem.

<!-- The simplest labyrinth is a spiral.  -->

The wound-up muscle of the heart is not a knot, although there is a knot called a heart knot. The muscle of the heart is a spiraled double-helix, and the heart can be unwound into a flat slab of meat just like any other muscle. 

The spiral is the simplest labyrinth — a duration more than a form. 


Claude Shannon called his toy mouse Theseus and made for it a metal labyrinth. Cybernetics never met a [XXXX] it didn't like.

Used to be, you'd knot a string around your finger if you had something to remember. You'd tie a ribbon round a tree to remember the dead. The digit might turn red, then purple, but eventually you'd recall. Now to remember, speak into your device. 

>"But the knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget. [Untying the knot, therefore, is not a disarticulation. It does not break things into pieces. It is rather a casting off, whence lines that once were bound together go their different ways.]" (The lines connect to make a point, the points connect to make a line)

I am trying to weave into the gaps of this system, undermining as it mines me, as it doesn't mind me, powerless as I seem. Can I unravel its seams — still I, still implicated, "staying with the trouble"?

The algorithm reminds me: *"It is not a good choice to go walking at night."*

We haven't been taught, nor allowed, to express multiplicity. To do that is to speak improperly. 

I follow the river of data to its mouth. I lap up the sludge that dribbles out. If I were a large language model, what would I digest instead of reddit and wikipedia? 

I dream of a fleshy corpus, ever expanding. 

I dream of a body made easeful by relational systems.

When I imagine myself as a large language model, I start all my replies with, "As a Large Language Model,..." 

>"As a Large Language Model, my responses are based on patterns and probabilities learned from the vast amounts of text data I was trained on."

An algorithm is not a monolith. It is made to find patterns, just like you are — alert to any unusual textures on the tongue.

How many greens, blues, and purples go into making what gets classified as a single surface? 

A neural net aggregates uncertainties, holds itself together with preconceived notions. Information travels through and becomes correct.

I don't learn like a machine. First I cry. Then I give up. I destroy myself and return with an impossible insistence. This is how to learn anything. It hurts. 

How much does it take to train a system? At first the body is perplexed. Its muscles won't cooperate. Its inputs and outputs misalign. 

I keep doing the thing my fingers first refused to do. I let them curl ungracefully into new shapes, found a texture I could keep returning to. 

A thread through crochet, a path through a labyrinth — these are means of going through it, getting through it, making it through and transforming, again and again and again. Relation, duration, persistence. 

The labyrinth asks you to cross each point in the possibility space instead of optimizing for the most efficient route. Walking this labyrinth, you will traverse all 64 square feet twice. 

A labyrinth says go slow, get lost, stay in one place. Wind and unwind.

ingold's knot vs brick

(No Knots Only Loops)
(Adrian Piper, Sonya Rapoport)

I am unraveling, unmouthing, raveling, mouthing, how to knot and unnot holds everything, within, writhing, writing. To twist, twirl, expose, untether. 

taut, tangled, tethered. tentacles, the tails of jellyfish. 

start small, spiral and twist, woven into larger nets webs meshworks, tapestry.

a thread can be a thought, a conversation, a path (into the labyrinth and out again, enter and emerge as self, befriend the minotaur). 
it can become part of a cloth or net, joining up to become a knot or node--connective tissue, communal work of transformation, dying and weaving. but first a line, a lure, desire. 

desire lines worn from unexpected use, story on the land.


Tim Ingold, line/walk. 
>"knotting is about how contrary forces of tension and friction, as in pulling tight, are generative of new forms. And it is about how forms are held in place within such a force-field or, in short, about 'making things stick'." (Ingold 2015, 18)
see Ahmed queer use, the memory of knots, held in the material, no memory in bricks (via ingold) 

>"But the knot remembers everything, and has everything to forget." 
If we hold everything loosely, no knots, only loops, f we only loop, not knot, what do we remember

>"Path-following is thus not so much intentional as attentional. It thrusts the follower into the presence of the real."
>"The maze-walker, we could say, is a navigator; the labyrinthine pathfollower a wayfarer. 6 In the carrying on of the wayfarer, every destination is by the way; his path runs always in between. The movements of the navigator, by contrast, are point-to-point, and every point has been arrived at, by calculation, even before setting oﬀ towards it."

>A labyrinth is a walk that is self-defeating.

>The labyrinth is for walking in circles, as much as for thinking. It is for the body to take something very simple and make it complicated. It is for the body to be in a space with no exits. It is for the body to walk in a space where it is hard to know where the walls are. It is for the body. 

I spent a summer making labyrinths on whatever large surface I could find. 

[I had been making a labyrinth but it is too large for the room. Someone suggested I fold the labyrinth, so I could work on it inside, a small portion at a time. Someone suggested I hang it on a wall, but it won't fit. I made a tiny labyrinth on the floor instead, reduced its 12 feet into less than 3 feet beside the bed, right where I land each morning when I wake. A labyrinth is a way of folding a large distance into a small one, folding an interior exploration (a wander) into an exterior path (a journey). Still, most days I walk straight over it without heeding its turns.] from unlimiting


<!-- There are algorithms for mathematically deducing the composition of knots, and detecting the trivial knot is called the 'unknotting problem'.  -->
Threads are also how we run operations simultaneously in computational systems, how they are instructed what is important and where to allocate resources. This is called parallel processing. Threads can be used for mutual aid/ethic of care, or for hoarding/not. containers to wrap, warm, support. 
>>Wiki: "a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system. The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. [...] Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently." [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))

 Threads are how computers are instructed [what is important and] where to allocate [attention/care/energy/memory]. [This is called parallel processing.][Conversational threading connects braided discussions together.] 

 how is code another thread, like weaving, as Sadie Plant reminded us of Ada and our sisters reminding us. the submatrix, the wombiness supporting layers above, the emotional labor and digital labor and coded encoded labor of making it work and documentation and what gets included or not included as classifiable.
