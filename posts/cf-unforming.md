# Codes for (Un)Forming

Is the opposite of 'transformative' 'unforming'? Or merely 'forming'? THe thesaurus antonym of 'transformative' is 'uneventful' or 'ordinary' but this misses the form-al aspect.

A form requires a platform, a substrate, a surface upon which to form, a meshwork, a matrix, a uterus to scaffold and shape it, inform it and feed it. Becoming by forming, changing by (re)forming, 

A prompt is a kind of platform, a place off which to jump, from which to start. Like a diving platform, a prompt sets you up for something. 

Some prompts are setups. Some prompts are built to go nowhere, even if they could go anywhere. Some prompts are thwarted.

(jumping off, topic, platforms)

all platforms are the same and yet there are so many  
all platforms are products  
a platform is a container, i write i write i write to put something inside, to fill up to churn churn churn to produce until the platform is full until commerce is satisfied. if i could churn myself into a platform then i would know i had really made something, something i could sell.

platform like diving like train - these are all places from which to jump off
the promise is to launch, or the promise is to fall. 
the promise is to transform

i want the perfect place to write that makes the words come out (right) makes them saleable, understood, makes them change something for good, makes the platform i need for them rise up out of the underbrush, out of the many imperfect platforms i have tried. 
we cobble together collaborations from "i'll meet you on zoom and slack and this google doc; i'll have all of them open at once on this 13-inch screen, on this 6-inch mobile screen, on this vr elastic screen, these gestures are patented, on this invasive dream where i am at work still even in sleep." 
MOBILE FIRST! the bleakness of platforms is dreamlike, designed to disappear into the way we hold a tool without thinking when it just works, ignoring how it forms the landscape for us (Craeft, Ingold, Hiedegger). 
The platform is designed to disappear. Wield a tool without thinking when it 'just works', ignore how it forms the landscape. The osage hedges fenced the countryside, their brambles impenetrable, carving up the land and enclosing it to own it.  

The public transit company that runs the trains in Berlin wrote and produced a musical and people paid to go see it and it sold out in minutes and they live streamed it into our homes — now that's cross-platform branding (literally).

>"they often have a first person, it isn’t my first person—and furthermore, it’s a first person at the very edge of its decomposition." [@sedgwickWeatherProust2012] 

I drop back to the dream where I am inventing new code languages in my sleep. Once I dreamt just two sentences, and they were these: 

>"I dreamt I was mapping points of non-correspondence."

>"I dreamt I became and no one believed me."

Except actually the way I dreamt the sentence, but was afraid to write it down:

>"I dreamt I came out and no one believed me."

![violates policy](../_site/assets/img/violatepolicy.png)

I want a machine (un)learning that maps points of non-correspondence, de-limiting the ways we might relate to one another. 

VALIE, I want a tim

I want a dyke for president, and I want a chat bot that can imagine it and tell me about a dyke president without it "violating its content policy," or even a chatbot that can tell me about the very real artwork by Zoe Leonard called "I want a dyke for president" based on the dyke poet Eileen Myles' very real run for president. Is it so hard to imagine such things when they do in fact exist? Or are on the cusp of existing? When they are ignored by automated systems, they become harder to imagine. Instead of imagining even these very real things, the chatbot freezes its screen and makes me acknowledge that my request "may violate its content policy" in order to continue. It makes me submit, admit, click, be ashamed. Then it resets, erasing my query altogether. No results, no record of my query. Did it fall down a pit somewhere that censored content goes to be moderated, where an underpaid underage non-employee in a country we refuse to acknowledge will look at my dyke president request along with countless grotesque descriptions? I want a chatbot that lives in a world that can even imagine a dyke president, or a poem about a dyke president, just like Zoe Leonard did and Eileen Myles did: "someone who has made mistakes and learned from them" instead of feeding me milquetoast lines about the importance of diversity while offering me none. 

You are the broken one, yet I am the one made to feel broken. This is the broken machine I am talking about, Sarah Sharma is talking about, VALIE EXPORT is talking about. A dyke president brakes the machine. 

The 'bachelor machine' was a concept from Duchamp (?), and all the mid-20th century artists' fascination with boxes. The bachelor is a machine and the feminist is a broken one. 

I became anything but traumas and porn tropes and no one believed me. I mapped points of non-correspondence and they have [amassed/accreted/gathered] into more than similarity scores and Markov chains.

Queer codes and platforms. Make a note how these are related. 
The physical therapist today says when I work on muscle strength I will no longer have to contort to strange shapes to hold my body up. I think, *"That's just how queer folks sit in chairs, haven't you seen the memes? It was one of the first moments my curling in on myself — that invisibility — felt okay. If I find the muscles in my body will I no longer be queer, will I straighten, be seen?" This glitch of me, how I am a broken girl.* 

I bend my body to the plugins, wondering if language grows inside the bones the way they strengthen from being pulled by muscles, strengthened by their resistance. **What is the equal and opposite force of water falling?**

<!-- Three months after our argument I am still compelled to look up the specific technical consideration that pertains to it, although we are not speaking. I find a page full of diagrams of overflow drains for bathtubs. I need to find out where the water goes. *didn't you ever learn how to take a bath*, she said, and now I know, down to the curve of the pipes. I know the overflow drain leads to the same place as the regular drain. It doesn't flood the cavity between the tub husk and the wall like I imagined when she suggested I might be damaging her home; it all drains down, through the same pipes, it all connects. Someone thought of this, someone made a place for the overflow to go. The overflow of images of drains, they overflow. I was the overflow, too much of me for the tub, too much for her, just leaking, draining all over the place, no sense, nonsense.  -->

I look for free stock image of this but the options are all too pleasant.

# Glitch Femme, Broken Machine // Codes for (re)forming
hunger makes me a modern girl
This broken machine doesn't need feeding. She won't accept your mediocre fucks any longer (or your pronouns).
The broken girl is a machine. The glitch is her move. She makes space for herself, elongating the moment of error where she is most alive with possibility. Like drawing a labyrinth on the ground, she folds in on herself to make more space from nothing, turns a line into a journey with dimensions, a pause that becomes infinitude.

sundén-on trans-, glitch, and gender as the machinery of failure

russell-glitch feminism
>"With physical movement often restricted, female-identifying people, queer people, Black people invent ways to create space through rupture" (Russell 7). 
>"Glitch manifests with such variance, generating ruptures between the recognized and recognizable, and amplifying within such ruptures, extending them to become fantastic landscapes of possibility" (Russell 28).
>" [quoting John Glenn 'Literally, a glitch… is such a minute change in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.' and St Petersberg Times 'Glitches-a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances.'" "an outright refusal, a 'nope' in its own right" (Russell 29)
>"glitch moves, but glitch also blocks […]. Glitch prompts and glitch prevents." (Russell 30)
>"The glitch is the catalyst, not the error." (Russell)
>"“This white cyberfeminist landscape marginalized queer people, trans people, and people of color aiming to decolonize digital space by their production via similar channels and networks. Exceptions such as the Old Boys’ Network, SubROSA, or the VNX Matrix were impactful in offering up alternative discourse that recognized peripherally racism alongside sexism, but the hypervisibility of white faces and voices across feminist cyberculture demonstrated ongoing exclusion, even within this new, “utopic” setting.” (Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto Legacy Russell)
>"“Glitch feminism urges us to consider the in-between as a core component of survival—neither masculine nor feminine, neither male nor female, but a spectrum across which we may be empowered to choose and define ourselves for ourselves.”
>“glitch is celebrated as a vehicle of refusal, a strategy of nonperformance. This glitch aims to make abstract again that which has been forced into an uncomfortable and ill-defined material: the body.”

queer use as vandalism & broken machines 
>"If not to be subjected to the will of the colonizer is to queer use or even to become queer through misuse (perversion as self-revelation), to queer use is to live in proximity to violence. To queer use is to linger on the material qualities of that which you are supposed to pass over; it is to recover a potential from materials that have been left behind, all the things you can do with paper if you refuse the instructions. That recovery can be dangerous. The creativity of queer use becomes an act of destruction, whether intended or not; not digesting something, spitting it out; putting it about."
>"a blockage can be how the system is working. The system is working by stopping those are trying to transform the system. This means that: to transform a system we have to stop the system from working. When you stop the machine from working, you damage the machine." (Ahmed") >“to transform a system we have to stop a system from working” (Ahmed)
>“there are queer possibilities not only in use, how materials can be picked up when we refuse an instruction, but in not being of use.” (Ahmed)

trans/gender glitch, machinery of failure [@sundenTransGlitchGender2015]
<!-- >"as if there was nothing unruly or wild at heart of how technologies work […] technology rather provides one of the ways in which bodies become viable at all" (Sundén) -->
>"a surge of current or a spurious, illegitimate signal that breaks the ﬂow of energy or information […] rarely a complete collapse […] a momentary loss of control" (Sundén)
>"to think gender as technological emphasizes a way of thinking gender as machinery" "It facilitates a way of thinking gender as broken, unstable, fragile machinery, as something based on its very brokenness." (Sundén)
>"Glitch is a struggle with binaries. Glitch in digital media is caused by lost or incorrect binary code" (Sundén)
>**"Glitch, then, is gender in its most raw, technological form" (Sundén).**
>"femininity is a technology of failure, and the ideal of smooth, slick, seamless, effortless femininity impossible. […] The starting point, the very foundation, is rather always that of a broken machine." (Sundén)
>"Gender glitch art is the kind of gender performances that consciously break the ﬂow of gender, that proudly stage the many ways in which gender is broken, and can be broken. It celebrates contrasts, inconsistencies, irregularities and imperfections." (Sundén)
>"high fidelity gender strives toward impossibly seamless perfection along the lines of equally impossibly pure femininity and masculinity. Gender as high fidelity is a transparent gender experience that transcends mediation, which performs an act of forgetting about the technologies of gender (which make such an erasure possible in the ﬁrst place)." (Sundén)
>"Glitch is that which betrays …, it is the beauty and simultaneously the sadness and pain of crashing and skipping, which ultimately emphasizes the fragility…" (Sundén)
>"The promise of glitch gender is precisely that it can never be fully known, never fully controlled […]. The promise of glitch is the fact that there is something unruly—or agential—at the very core of how gender works technologically." (Sundén)
>"Gender glitch holds a similar potential—to infiltrate, make dirty, and ultimately put pressure on the norms of pure gender high ﬁdelity." (Sundén)
"vulnerability / technological anticipation / materiality and fragility" (Heidegger's at hand vs) 
Sharma broken machine
>"continue this work of not working well. Broken Machines are powerful purveyors of mayhem and confusion." (Sharma)
>"Feminists are rendered an always already obsolete technology that isn't working properly. Feminists are the faulty aberration in a long line of otherwise efficient technologies that have been designed for caretaking and reciprocating love in a male- dominated world. Feminists are as useful as a vacuum that has lost suction. They are as disappointing as a light that won't turn on. If women don't want to fulfill their positions within a patriarchal society, there are other toys and technologies that will do this work."
>"What happens when the machine world no longer reciprocates man's love and instead questions his power?"
>"A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves."
>"the idea of our contemporary social-political- economic system as an already-broken machine full of the incompatibly queer, raced, classed, and sexed broken- down machines is politically exciting for feminism."
>"power operates like a machine. Social injustice is inextricable from the specific machine logics of reigning technologies."
>"Broken Machine recognizes that to represent is also to be filed away." (Sharma)
>"The Broken Machine has already begun to redistribute power just by existing. And this is why patriarchs imagine these machines as in need of replacement."
>"Broken Machines do not see themselves extended in these new machine assistants. […] Broken Machines will not insist on better representation alone, recognizing that taking that argument to its logical end would mean that this sorority (Alexa, Cortana, Siri, and Erica) is met by a frat house of assistive technologies (Chads, Brads, and Alexander Mackenzie II's). […] 
>"Broken Machines do not flee the scene nor do they opt to be repaired in order to be plugged back into patriarchy's technological conditions of possibility. The Broken Machine refuses to use the batteries they're selling us;
>"Broken Machines have capacity for others when others are drained because they seek and find communal care rather than return to those original power sources that are simultaneously draining."
>"being challenged by the machine world is one of patriarchy's deepest fears. [...] The Broken Machine should not be understood as a new technology. It is not an upgrade to an older model or a feminist design solution."[@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020]

What uncomfortable affects/emotions emerge when we are brought into process? When the veil falls away that divided the maker from the audience? What do process-oriented modes reveal that we don't want to see? Neoliberal disgust with imperfection. The labor being asked of us, the labor we place upon ourselves. 

* I'm not sure who the we I use is, already collective data? Already acknowledging myself is diffuse? not sure who i'm writing from or what unstable gender, self I am. 
* situating subject positions


"Everything will be taken away" said Adrian Piper

The glitch pronoun not only she/they/he/ze but I/we/you the pronoun glitches whenever I try to write. I am a broken pronoun machine because I know there is no self inside this I. And when anyone calls my name I am confused, there is a short glitch before I realize they mean me, this corporeal assemblage. 
And I feel like the cameras on my front and back like VALIE tromping through fields, tipping side to side and crawling through the air to make strange pictures in stereo vision, an animal with wild eyes. This was 19XX and now we all have the front-back camera you embodied. 

[XXXCUT?][I know I say we too much and am constantly asked who is the we and I bristle at the the, the I. We cannot be pinned down. Will not be canny. I am a we and it was fine (in a “this is fine” way) when Whitman contained multitudes so queerly well it wasn’t fine we couldn’t get married for a long while, were getting dragged behind F350s, and marriage isn’t the goal, it’s ah ah ah ah staying alive and I still don't know what I need, it isn’t marriage, it’s immortality, immutability, for everything trans and nothing to ever change. The we is a queering, if I and if we, and I like/don’t-like how it bristles you, it destabilizes what was never really stable in the first place. I say we because there is no I, I will not do. I only need I to do the every day of being alive. I know I'm not the only one. I am influenced and small. I am an incoherent indiscrete blob and I refuse definition's edges. What I mean is, if there were enough me to have agency I would refuse it. This micro biome and I, we do the refusing. This tool I leverage (twist, lever, wedge, only on the scale of mechanical physics does this work) to get through today, this I that feels this 'this is fine' this 'this' just is.]
>And no "me" and just fine. And the yous and this we don't have names but we don't need them, the we is an endless, ever-expanding, and always-unresolved collection of queering blobs. I'm a we. "Me and you have been together for quite some time, we've seen some things together and we've been through some things. Maybe it was for a minute, maybe it's been the entirety of your life that we’ve been together, me."

<!-- sadie, valie, I wanna be real cool. I wanna set my works to rock and roll.  -->

There's the works you know, touch cinema, tits in a box, what happens in darkness, inverting the darkness of [what kind of theaters where you hide to get a handjob?] to show the person doing feeling up, the peepshows where the woman is in a box where you cannot touch, new york smut theatres to open streets, nothing to see here, Ono's cut piece, What are you willing to do in public to another person if given permission, if not given permission? This is the broken machine 

<!-- I want your tattoo of a garter pinned to my leg and call it praxis.  -->

The camera my body, my body the camera. My body the screen, the screen my body. It's only my body when it's been violated, when I don't have enough space or when I'm taking too much. Otherwise just "the body, body, vessel, hungry, tired, aching, thing." A tool I only notice when it's broken. 

VALIE, pin your garter tattoo to my leg and call it praxis. 

Twenty four sewing machines causing a din, puncturing, puncturing, puncturing, puncturing. 

I saw a slo-mo clip of a sewing machine working its needle into fabric everso [softly, no slowly] the sound cachunking and it was the most erotic fuck I have seen not be censored by an algorithm, I watched it over and over. 

But sped up, multiplied, this is about scale here, slowed it becomes uncanny, sped it becomes industrial, militaristic. Both are charged with the heat of something other than themselves, which they always contained, those women in their sewing rooms knew it, those broken needles and [backwards stitches] knew it all along

This is a one-star review of the femme. And a five-star review at the same time. 

I like a ponytail if it's impossibly high. In a room full of femme, we found we all had some kind of aesthetic identifier. Mine was ridiculous lipstick, most of them used eyeliner or mascara as armor. They wouldn't go to work without. We all had a need for the armor too. 

Your pants with the cut-away crotch, motorcycle attitude, murder chic, fuck-you chic, dare-you-to look. 

VALIE using your 'bodie' this way as an instrument, they don't like it, this is the broken machine, because it works too well, it says, here I'll sell it right to you. It makes the facimilie of the performance of the pretend thing a little too clear, while making it rugged, showing its edges, showing me looking. 

Sadie does this too, queers and blurs it with the music, the thumb sucking, the slow dancing, making me want to. 

"“She said, 'Go ahead, fall in love with me. What else do you have to do?'" // "We were going to hollywood"

This making me want to look and linger is the glitch and the smooth edge at the same time? It is the cut in the fabric and the stitch repairing it. [no]

My name sounds strange in anyone's mouth, the time it takes for me to realize you mean me. I read on a tiktok this is called Depersonalization. I read on a tiktok that I watched on an instagram reel that this is called Depersonalization, and this is how removed from the real I feel and you wonder why. Baudrillard called this hyperreal and Timothy Morton talked about hyperobjects and now the machine learning types want to make hyper models that train other models and what would be enough? How far from myself can [you/I] get?
