first impressions? Wow, so long ago? This is probably back in like maybe freshman year, like Freshman Spring or something. I saw a poster or email that mentioned code collective and there's an email that I could email and I guess it was you. Or no. I think it was a for a Google format. first. So I signed up, and then I came to the first meeting.

And I was curious. I wish i'd remember what the what the form had said, but it was something about like creative coding, and I was like, I don't know what i'm gonna do yet. But that sounds really close to what I want to do. They came. There were lots of different people from many disciplines. And we just talked about what we were interested in, and had, like some discussions about like creative ways to use code. 
And that was a really exciting first meeting for me, and then for a while kind of dropped off, because I think I can fit fit in my schedule, or I think, at one point I was like I can make the meetings but now, but but I've like already missed so many that I feel really awkward going back because I felt like I didn't really know anybody, and I didn't want to like barge back in. I didn't know like what necessarily the culture was so I wish I had gone back. I could have had more meetings but at some point I started coming back, and became a regular and then like more and more.

I felt like, Oh, it's like not just like something that Sarah's leading, but also like we're all part of this club, and like we can sort of like talk about whatever we want to it's like what we make of it A. And so now like to me, **the club is like something that's like our home for like discussing and sharing and doing creative code things together**. and it's just like a really positive and safe and exciting environment to be in. 

_Do you know what the things were that let you know that you could make it your own?_

I think it's definitely like the tone that you set of like, I feel like these are things that you you said over and over again. That it's like it's not something it's not like you're you know, like the teacher and like for the students, and like you there's like a like a schedule for each session but it's more like we group of like-minded people who all have things to learn from each other, and cool things that we're working on. 
And so like I feel like it's like natural when you go and you talk to other people. You're like Oh, that's so cool that you're doing so and so like I want to learn more and then the it sort of naturally evolves from there.

**Collective is a collaborative co-working co-learning place for people who are curious about code or are curious about creative ways to use code or code-y ways to be creative. And it's a very welcoming environment, and there's a lot, though we can come and learn together.**

Creative code collective: Come code collaboratively
Okay, all the although, like Co. **the prefix is, is really feels really relevant, like collating, co-working, collaborating just doing things together.**

>what are the essential part essential components of code collective, what parts are important to you like, technically, socially, emotionally, collaboratively, artistically, politically, what makes it what makes it go vroom

**I think the snacks are definitely a big jaw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid. I think the the fact that we all like making each other feel like we're all an equal part of the community in terms of, we all have stuff to share, even if it's not like products that we're working on. We have like opinions about things, and we can offer opinions on each other's projects or answers to questions.**

So I think that's really good and in in circumstances where it's like, I think something that I've noticed is like sometimes people who aren't as vocal or proactive in speaking up because I feel like so, sometimes where i'm like like, Other people will be like here's just like out of the blue like, "Here's a project that I'm working on, check it out, it's so cool." And then sort of my my instinct in a lot of situations is I won't necessarily speak, unless asked about it, which I try to be more proactive sometimes, but sometimes that is what I fall back on.

**And so the culture of encouraging each other, and like proactively asking after each other, I think has been really helpful for me.** In terms of asking each other, "What have you been working on, or what do you think of this?" Even when that person isn't necessarily the first to speak up 

'''
<<XXX>>
_or answer to say like proactively asking after each other, I like that._
'''

>>I like that I don't think that that's something that I would like consciously built in, or it felt affected at first. But it really it feels really important it's kind of my favorite part of the meeting.

Now, it always kind of **turns into the whole meeting like there's never a point where it's not that we just sort of unconsciously segue into the troubleshooting of one of the things that people share, yeah show and tell.**

>How would you describe the code collective approach to coding? Does the working, teaching, learning, making style feel different in any way?

Yeah, I feel like I don't I feel like i'm still thinking about this a lot because I feel like by this point we've kind of collected a bunch of regulars. But the regulars that come at this point are people who are more comfortable with code.

I would say and are always working on it project and usually like comfortable with whatever technology that we're talking about, or at least familiar with it or heard of it.

Have some kind of connect, like understanding of how to connect to it. That kind of thing. 

I don't know if, like we haven't been sort of making enough space for people who are more beginners. So I'm still thinking about that. 

But **I think the idea of it has always been to create a space where you don't have to know everything. And it's not like class where you come and you're everyone's working towards one point, and how good you are is it is defined by how well you know the technology, how well you can do something.** Because, the club is like inherently multidisciplinary, so people will have different strengths, a different background. And so **we'll be working with different things. and we'll come with different assumptions about things,** and so the idea is we can <<XXX>> by sort of co-learning and co-working.

We can offer our own unique perspectives. and then, like certifying joy in like the process of like learning, and like going through the journey together. <<XXX Who said this?>>

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, yeah, I Yeah. I think The The goal is always to work towards a culture of encouraging scrappy code.

**And being okay with not being the best at every tool in technology.**

<<ME>>
>>**The approach is that it is possible to learn any part of it. We're not gonna come in knowing everything we're not gonna leave knowing everything either.Everybody comes in with the expectation of capacity, like even if somebody comes in cold, we are welcoming in the sense of like Oh, it's really cool that you want to know that and like, let's help you figure it out, or even if it's somebody who's a regular, and is very adapt a lot of languages, they might be tackling something that is new to them and approach is same. Like: I don't know these like fragment shaders but and it's super confusing, but I'm gonna approach it with the same attitude, like eventually I'm gonna figure out this problem.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000<<XXX>>
So it's sort of yeah, not her that we the level that approaches the same.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Yeah, Yeah, I think that's true. maybe I would also add in my answer that **we encourage curiosity and self startership.** Yeah, Well, I guess I guess back to my original, like hesitation about the beginners thing is that I feel like we have had a lot of people come by, even if it was just once but they were like I don't know anything about code. but what you're doing sounds really exciting and then they hang out, and they learn couple of like big ideas about like what's going on. And even if it's not something that, like an environment they would want to come back to regularly, just because it's like not necessarily in their wheelhouse, which is totally fine, like **just by having this space of of discovery and co-learning, we can show people even just passersby that this is a kind of thing that you can explore.**

>>Yeah, I love that. Yeah. and I think we we're still practicing like not steamrolling people with our excitement.But about being like, let me show you how to do this in like, you know. yeah, E7 script and Python list comprehensions. Let me show you the most efficient, like tight, nerdy way to express it like, Let me show you the concept or get you excited about it. 

>What is the spirit of code collective, and what are values? What kinds of things would you include in like our manifesto, or how? And then how do we demonstrate or embody those values?

I think, like the spirit is curiosity, excitement, piggybacking off a couple of things.

You just said curiosity, excitement, there's a certain sense of like vulnerability in there, where it's like you don'tâ€”It's not like you're showing off to each other sometimes it's like it's like showing off but it's like in a way that you're like you I struggle to I struggle through this to make this thing that I'm really proud of and there's it's not a sense of competition, because nobody's working on the same thing. But it's more of like I made this really cool thing that I'm really proud of, and I really want to show you guys and talk about like how we can better support... We can support each other and encourage each other and things like that.
<<WHO?>>
So yeah curiosity, excitement, vulnerability. Community. collaboration. Yeah, I think hopefully, like a lot of the words that were mentioned in the previous question.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000
>Are there specific ways you think that we like embody those or put them forward that share not to you.

**I really like the the times that we troubleshoot problems and projects, because then it really shows not everyone knows everything, and we all have things to learn from each other and teach each other.**

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000<<WHAT?>>
And through that process of I feel like I troubleshooting.

That seems to be really successful when you've done them because first of all, **just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do.**

**But then also, like other people, will have different perspectives. and also just kind of having that space to like work through it together, like having the time to like sit down and be like, Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code, and then getting to different steps and like going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through.**

>Yeah, yeah, I know, like last week, when I was feeling completely like obliterated. It really helped me to just like talk through. Yeah, But even though I felt like my problem was stupid, and I'd already thought through it alone in exactly the same way as I was even like tired of explaining it because I had explained it to myself in my head. It made something through it out loud, and I left feeling much better than I came in. 

And even if you like, there's no there isn't a problem, the problem isn't solved there is still a sense of like validation and support that you get just from being the vent to somebody that was helpful.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:30.000
>Yeah, has creative code collective affected how you engage with Code in general, or as a creative critical practice like what has shifted for you about how you work.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I think the first thing that comes to mind is that it's a huge source of inspiration from like the things that we the things that we show each other about, like what we're working on. But also the resources that we drop in the chat. The things that we look at during our meetings. I mean the world of creative coding is so big, and there's always so much to explore, and you always find things every day that you never would have thought of. Another thing that comes to mind is like, Now I think now that I like how built up connections with a bunch of the people in the club I have a sense of each, because each person has their own background in their own specialties, or their things that they're interested in. **I feel like I have like a network of resources almost like if i'm working on.** If I venture into like web VR for example I know Okay, I can ask Samir if I have problems.

<<CHECK RECORDING>><<<<<<<<00:22:40.000 --> 00:23:09.000>>>>>>>>>
So resources are key. And And the third thing is, I guess it just keep it just is always like very encouraging to like in the <<WHAT?>> in the because, like, I think the most most of the tech world is so is is quite toxic and like Techbury,<<WHAT?>> and like on twitter you always see a lot of stuff about like you have to code this way. There's one right way to code and like like how can you be the best coder he'd be the 10 excess 100 X engineer. <<WHAT?>>

**It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like. Okay, you don't have to be that you can go in your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one but one right way to code.**

I love that. Yeah, it's really freeing or like I don't know that feels too simple. But it's really yeah, really appreciate that. 

>Do you feel like code collective has shipped it affected how you engage with code as a like a political or intersectional practice at all.

I think it's like I don't know if it's like code, collective, or you like your work.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000<<<<WHAT?>>>>
Yeah, because I think, like to Miko collective is more about the community. 
And your work is more about like definitely about community as well. But there's like an explicitly political aspect to it. So I've been really really inspired by your Intersectional AI work. In terms of thinking about code as a non-neutral, politically powerful and relevant platform.

Trying to think about like code collective I don't know. I feel like maybe there is something underlying the idea of  community and collaboration, and collaborating politically, But for me, I just like that the thing that most <<WHAT?>>meatly dump tonight is your work in intersectional AI

>>Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. I mean, I do think of the practice of making and maintaining a collective or like, I guess by that I mean just the practice of us being together, and how we do what we are doing as political it's but it is interesting to hear that code collective feels more neutral. Because I do. I do feel like our our think of our values as being more political or intersectional. But I have always wondered like how much of the sort of politics, of code, or how I think of critical coding get into people's projects. Especially as other folks are coming into the space more that aren't media arts folks, like how much is that affecting their projects?

It'll be interesting to see. There's a lot of source of discussion in the projects that we work on and encounter in the wild, like... When we first started seeing Dahzi at the meetings, I forget their pronouns. Dahzi was working on a lot of AI stuff, and we immediately started talking about like a lot of the ethics around, and and like controversy of surrounding AI and NFTs. And they were really I feel like they were quick to really jump in and join the discussion about how they were feeling. And I feel like that's a hard conversation to have or **hard to find a space somewhere else that would host those kinds of discussions. And so I feel like you probably talk a lot about, like the politics of like community and inclusion like I mean, I guess that is political.** But for me, I guess, what first came to mind was the fact that **it is a community where we can hold space for having those discussions.**

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
<<XXX>[which is a] Political thing. Yeah, Yeah, I think so, too. I appreciate that.

>But the last 3 questions on my list are: What do you like about what do you? What would you change about co- Collective? and what would you take with you from your experiences?

**What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together.**

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
>So the community aspect of it is really important. What would I change about color collective?

**It's small and tight, and we have a bunch of regulars. but I also feel like maybe there are other people out there who were not reaching who might be interested or where we can like the community, would benefit from having them as well, we're even like not just individuals. like other organizations like, I think, the a student assembly for accessibility with having some discussions about technological accessibility.** And I was thinking about like potentially bridging that those 2 things but I know we've had this discussion a lot about like how much we want to be involved in like campus life. 
In a sense like it is nice to just be like a very low key group, or we don't have to deal with like the bureaucracy of becoming a student organization. But if there was like a way to like, get more involved without it being too much work, that might be something interesting to explore.

>What would you take with you? Yeah, what we take with you from your experiences?

It has given me a better understanding about how to talk about code. I feel like code and technology and people who engage with code and technology. In terms of like 
It's made me more curious about not just the code in the project itself, but also the process, like what you went through to get there and what are you working on. Now, how are you inspired to do this? What were some challenges that you ran into? Is there any way that I can offer any opinions or help with what <<XXX>>are we doing next? Just as a way of understanding that **all the technology that we built comes from a person or a bunch of people and they went on a journey to get there, and that journey is inherently very interesting.**

>Do you have a favorite like memory or moment from code collective?

Oh, memory I think there was one time where I was presenting this project. I'd done it, my internship where it was like like a processing project. And it featured like this ink simulation. And then I remember people were asking me how I did it. And I got to like do some whiteboarding and explain bit shifting and how to do operations in color. And I don't think I fully understand what I was saying. But it's like **a really fun experience to like to teach and learn and like teach and learn at the same time, and feel like we are all, like there wasn't any lesson, plan, or anything.** <<XXX>>You just kind of stemmed from like our own curiosities about each other, and what we were doing. And I love teaching as well personally. So that was a fairly fun time.

>I remember that day that was really fun, and I remember how, in awe of that work everyone was.

>I'm going to search the recording before I forget but we don't have to start right away, either. Did it notify you? I was like Why, didn't it notify me I'm being surveilled.

So I change my opinions of surveillance so much over the years like like i'm so not the same.

>Yeah, which way did you go from anxious to relaxed, or vice versa, or some other trajectory?

It's like I mean I originally was very incensed at kind of how this constitutional right against surveillance or against kind of government agencies doing so. But there's this kind of a flagrant violation from many different government bodies, and in doing that, And then also, you know, when we use any of these services, we give up our right for surveillance and for for kind of data sharing, and and all of that. And then citizens united, meaning companies can be kind of personal bodies with the same rights as us. So I kind of like reoriented and thinking that Perhaps there's some utility to the state for surveillance that is beneficial for people so many things that we use like Ben benefit from Mass data aggregation like map services, even allocation of resources. For you know, for equity. all of these things require kind of government data gathering that it's it's It's part of it.

>Yeah, I guess it's more about who's the body that's doing it. And how is that being done with consideration? And is it the government or a private entity?

And who's profiting from it and all of that too, and it just feels so out of like out of my hands as an individual. Although, like there are signs in in I guess, like I went to visit family, this last weekend, and there was a license played reader on a road, and it was labeled as a license plate leader, reader, So it can like tell people that Oh, it's logging your license plate. 

>Yeah, yeah, I don't if they're like Okay, full transparency. You're this is happening rather than it's happening but you just don't know like if that's a step in what direction we've moved like that. it's just at first it was like Oh, that's better but now I'm also like Oh, people have it's like incrementally. We just get used to these things, and then we yeah I don't have a choice. I'm already going down that road literally yeah and i've voice. I can't put the brakes on and choose not to go past it.

Yeah. And also I was reading about how in China they just have had pervasive surveillance In a while, but there is kind of a common rhetoric of It's safer just given that there's just so many more people, and and so much more of a fear of bad actors in their society may be stoked by the government, but like kind of the the pervasive surveillance is something that keeps people safe in a line. So there's that kind of attitude 

>Yeah, yeah I mean all of that adds to definitely informed by our overall individualists versus their a more collective approach to identity. We definitely you know there's always been those arguments of like, Oh, well, why do you care if you're being surveilled?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If you don't have anything to hide and it was like the other thing, where like?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Suppose you do catch someone doing a theft on camera unless you have like the financial resources to go after someone the cops Won't do anything in this police state, right?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They only really serve a smaller portion right and that's Also, the problem is like It's not really to serve the people.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It's you know cops protect property and they're like if it's, you know, body cameras don't protect citizens.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
They protect the cops, wearing them from all intents and purposes.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The guy had this notion of like Maybe we can make these variables that have like kind of like, you always have like an alibi like It's just your own personal surveillor, so like you can just always have irrevocable evidence. around you because but I don't I don't know it's like a dash camp but for your personhood.

>Yeah, Yeah, I mean that's a definitely like a blackmail episode waiting to happen. 
>I think this is really interesting. I feel like this is totally because of conversations that we have in code collective. So I feel like asking if the code collective or things like it have changed the way you think about questions like this.

**I don't think I would have had and like it's the only space I've had to like feel like thinking like this was okay like like this whole time.** Yeah, I mean as a as someone who would lecture in front of people like, even while I was studying. **It was kind of like, very isolating to think about the other aspects of technology. So creative code collective was the only space** I mean there were other spaces like like Corpus colosum, which was art and technology, so there was the ability to express kind of the graphical merit or kind of interesting like aspects over there. But as far as critically looking at code and how it relates to society personhood like it's it's been the only only section only space for that.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
That's really interesting because especially because it was sort of you know.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's like creative creative code collective so at first I wasn't.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I think we definitely overlap with corpus callosum and I don't.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I wasn't intentionally thinking of us as being that different, except for maybe feeling more not to like put them on a put.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Call them to task but like have the the sort of like welcoming kind of chill make like making at the meetings kind of vibe. I haven't been to their meeting, so I don't know but I don't like that I

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:31.000
would say their utility was more for engineers who are stuck in a rigid engineering curricula to have some opportunity to try new things, and I think that's as far as they've gotten as an institution or as like something

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that's like lasted with a perpetual structures. It gives engineering students an opportunity to to like step out technically everyone.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And that's that's what they're kind of affordance is so.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It's quite separate than than than code collective

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:55.000
How would you describe code collective? then? code collective is very free for it?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So it's not it doesn't have structure like corpus closed, some would and I feel like there's a huge sense of individualism, so code collective in all of its forms because it's changed over the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:23.000
pandemic, too. But people are coming to there with coming to to the gathering with their own projects, their own ideas rather than corpus closing, which is like people are put into groups in order to execute on something it's

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:34.000
very task-oriented as a womanization. Whereas this Isn't is a task oriented, or goal, or like a like goal oriented in the same way.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay, that's yeah that's interesting and helpful Yeah.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And I was because I was wondering if you met like the the first another difference being that we don't we're not focused on engineering students who want to explore a more artistic project.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But also that we're not then put in like you know that we're maybe mainly focused on non-engineering students.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:12.000
But then welcoming to engineering students. but we're also not doing like a kind of hacker space or hack.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Hackathon approach where it's focus sprints on a group work.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It's more exploratory and ongoing yeah I think there's like 2 things to that there's.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Yeah, I think it can lend itself. to engineering students stepping up because we've seen that there have been a couple of engineering students come by and derive benefit from it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000
But I I do think that there's kind of a sense like people have to come to the collective as individual agents definitely with like there has.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:59.000
There is kind of a requisite like either scale or or kind of like attempt, or like some sort of project that people have to possess in order to drive something from code collective.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Yeah, or at least in like interest or desire like i'm thinking of Robbie, who was like I don't know any code.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Here I am. Yeah, what do I do so there's there's some sort of like intrinsic like yeah, something intrinsic.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Whereas co-operosome like I mean for a lot of the bulk of its existence was a no-cut organization.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So it would just get the Rejects from other engineering organizations.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So imagine getting to Usc. which is more competitive than Ivy League and then applying to a student organization that'll have a 2% acceptance rate.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So a lot of students are coming to their engineering school, hoping to get some experience outside of their classes, not getting in and then ending up in corpus course, because Corpus Closer will have an attitude of welcoming

00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:03.000
everyone so like, you know, it exists even yeah it exists different than that, because Corpus close to me, could come in with no experience or no real motivation, and you could just be put to work.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Really like it's very structured you know none of the work in in Code Collective has ever been structured towards a project or a goal or a task in the same way.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That something that you would want? Is that something you would change?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:39.000
No, Okay, that I would change I think that that it's an important. It's almost like a salon right like or what I had to imagine like like in what like pre French revolution people thinking about stuff ha Yeah, Yeah, I like that

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I'm gonna tap off coffee really quick, and Then Okay, sorry.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:25.000
The coffee is really full, and I made a huge mess.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:06.000
When you can see the coffee from the zoom you know It's full the spill later i'm like imagining bumping the desk.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I love that i'm thinking of it as like a salon. That's maybe really good word, thank you.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I do I feel like that sort of like that's what I was hoping for in a way.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:46.000
There were moments where I was like imagining it having more structure or like, but I also wasn't really sure like wanting it to wanted it to like organically become what it needed to be, but not always sure what that is or felt like

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it that that was definitely going to change as the people in it were going to change.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And so it was, imagining that, like one version of it was that we might do projects together.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But that definitely didn't seem to be as much what people needed is just like the space for connection.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Yeah, because everyone has spaces to do projects. Everyone is being made to do for reasons.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Definitely I mean like this is special there's a huge lock of like being able to talk about code or tech as an intellectual or not. Is it like, yeah outside of the boundaries of like executing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:46.000
On tasks. that's interesting. how did you first hear about co- collective And what were your first impressions when Tara introduces?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Okay, yeah, very cool. what did you kind of yeah? What was your first?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Yeah, when did we go first? I can't remember must have been 20?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000
19, right? yeah. Well, 2 years ago you and auto went together the first time, so I don't.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I don't know down in the basement I don't know if i'm you auto back.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Then. yeah, I don't remember if it was just I think it might have been just you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Oh, young man, I feel very old today there's always Someone older. I think I'm more than I think I have a good 10 years on you, so don't worry about it. I think so.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
How old are you today? 26 today? Yeah, That's what I thought.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Wow! do you Do you have a 10 years of it? 1212 12 years of me?

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Oh, my gosh, Yeah. So yeah, you're welcome yeah So did you like What was your sense of it when you first Can you like?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Cast your mind back. Yeah, I mean like how it's evolved. Yeah, back.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Then I was a little bit more into creative code as a concept I i've kind of like i've like shed any desire to be attached to that anymore.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I was really just into the creativity and the artistry of things like processing things like open frameworks.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Arduino all of those frameworks use to kind of creatively express or do interesting projects, So that's one end, and also, like the other stuff like open source privacy, rights that are kind of cultural analogs to these

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
communities and injustice with Ai or justices with big tech and inequity.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I feel like there's kind of like I I won't even call it left.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But there's sort of whenever you use tech in a creative manner or an attack in a non-capitalist or non like vocational manner.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I don't want to say capitalist, because anything could be complex, but like for nonvocational manner, there there can be a value set that's in common that a lot of ideas and actions can stop from so like a kind of seeking that

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
community, or seeking kind of people that would be aligned with those values.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:37.000
That's what create a code club to provide it we are, and I like to be, I mean, I also like to be our out students learning how to code.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I think we learn a lot from teaching anyone who's experienced in code can be like understands that we learn also through trying to solve problems.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So seeing other people's problems is a very helpful thing Yeah. yeah, definitely.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Did it feel like a different way of teaching 2? No, it felt very honestly.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:13.000
It felt very similar to when I was working at Intel, and there were people people had to work together on problems, or, if they were, probably would escalate, or you bring it to the neighbor and ask for it. so opportunity to take like real vocational experience and

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
bring it outside of that like kind of the collaborative nature that you would see in problems.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Yeah, you could see that there interesting yeah i'm I'm.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Surprised to hear, too, that there are more opportunities to have those kinds of those components that you're talking about around the the cultural pieces of code.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Those to have those conversations elsewhere, or that there's not a culture around that elsewhere.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
But yeah, there were some communities that I could see it a little bit but it was hard to find in person.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So that was something that that you kind of did like amazingly because you could find that on the Internet if you were to seek it out, there are meetups and gatherings.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000
But they're super weird. What What makes them weird that we did it do like what?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
What made this different or what? Yeah, Because it was already within the context of the university community.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
So by being membership of the University common community there's something in common, Right?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yeah taking advantage of that, I think like code collective wouldn't function the same way in another thing like i'm imagining people I know around my or like you know, in our station of life where we're kind of like it's

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:44.000
like not in the undergraduate education system so it's a lot harder like it's a lot harder to maintain creativity to maintain like these kind of attitudes.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Yeah, Yeah, I know it does exist. But I think it's focused a lot more around the like creative human show in tel side.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And it's in the one I know of is in Berlin.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:04.000
So yeah we hacker people like the hockey day community.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Super fun I don't even know she's part of this, like trans collective thing that like makes, in some sense for a burning man. and like just like very connected to a lot of crazy applications of technology, so just

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
she's in that community. but it's not it's very rigid like for them.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It seems to be very task-oriented like they're trying to do X projects, so that they get their buddies to like gather to do it.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I don't know. Yeah, Okay, so you're like if you're already part of another community.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So it like shrinks the pool somehow. already. Then you can kind of form that community within a community that like she I'm.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Also thinking about the game. Deaf community, like the game-depth community, has something very similar to what we have actually so like.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I mean in her in her case like they're very creative they do stuff.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But it's very task-oriented like they're trying to execute on a project, and that's how people gather and there's all the there's like kind of an incentive like Oh, you get to

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
go to burning Man, or oh, you get to like do this event, or something right?

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So that there's. kind of like a exchange of labor for something. The game deaf community has a very has similar like salon type gatherings.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
So i've been to it's glit city I hope they're back up.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I want we should go. We should we should go check them out and see what they're like.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Post pandemic. but all the Indie game community and people in the industry gather, and they play games, and then they talk about games.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So they talk about the other dimensions of their industry, and the same casual way.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I was in P. So now, just like we would do.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000
What do you feel like? Are the essential components of code collective like?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:14.000
What are the parts that are important to you that make it run the like? whether that's technically socially emotionally, politically, I think I think food was a huge component.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I think Harvard Academy also believes in food.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
It brings people together, it puts people on the same level.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Whenever people die together, it like it. it puts it it levels the playing field, and it kind of brings a sense of equality.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:36.000
That's important. huh! I think also when we do the like kind of like round circle where everyone can introduce themselves and what they're working on.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And you know. have a moment where people to respond like Oh, that's so cool or like.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Have you thought about this that's really important to like give everyone the the spotlight, or to and to like share stuff.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And just seeing, Yeah, that was so awkward at first for me to initiate that I was like, I felt like I was imposing some order on our system that was orderless.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And first of like that I was gonna make everybody like bristle with like, who's this coming in and putting down the hammer?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:24.000
But it's come I feel like it's come to really like , it would like fill up the rest of the time, too, because by the time we get around we have the agenda for the rest of the it's

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:35.000
like. Oh, well, let's look at this person's issue or Let's like I want to see more of this or it helps to negotiate like. How do we allocate the time for the rest of the meeting like it gives a

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
very like democratic way of figuring that out.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And then also, like people come there for inspiration people come there to like to connect. I like to like you know we, by learning about other people's projects.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
We learned as well. So It's a very Efficient way to kick off a meeting.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Like I feel like you could get maybe like 50% of the benefit just to tempting that right?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:10.000
That's cool Yeah, that's helpful how I maybe I we already kind of talked about this.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:20.000
But would do you feel like the code collective approach to coding or working teaching making feels different than in any way.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yeah, It's I mean we touch Upon It It's This salon type of learning.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I think it's unstructured I think it's it's different, because the the individual participant sets what they're they are working on. so there's no prescription as far as what an

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
individual is going to be working on and I think it also comes with like like that's a huge affordance.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:02.000
But then the other. The other side of it is that a participant needs to have the volition, or have the intrinsic nature of creating their own projects, or like bringing something to the table.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:15.000
I feel like i'm like looking through my questions and as as we've just been talking casually.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I feel like we've covered a lot of them but maybe asking them in a different way.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000
We'll bring other stuff out. How would you describe co- collective to someone who'd never heard of it like.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:34.000
If you were writing our motto what would it be Oh, It's the where the cool coders hang out out of the caddling industry.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I was like. Come on, there's a it's where all the cool coders are it's kind of what it is.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I mean like to like reduce it if I had to be more formal about it.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I would say it's it's like a it's like a informal gathering of creative coders. I could do it that could encompass it.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Well, salon is a pretty good term yeah that's great

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
What would you say? Is the spirit of it, or what are our values?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:25.000
How would we demonstrate or body those values like? What would we put in our manifesto? I was thinking about that this morning because I was like I was wondering what you would put in a manifesto.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Or you know, if I were to do something like to reinstantiate, or to mimic or to get grab something like this in Santa Cruz.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
But I don't know what my life is going to be like in the next chapter.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
But yeah, individualism is a huge part of It I think that There's definitely the like.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
The empowerment, like empowerment, is another is a really important thing.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I think everyone has you know there's there's always kind of a supportive environment kind of people are trying to help enable someone to accomplish their goals.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
So there's that there's it's cooperative another value.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
You can always bring a problem and have people like willing to listen to it.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
At least people will also offer a debug offer to debug and help you.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Problem solve creative. the creatives in the title so I think there's also a value set that's very I don't know what term encompasses it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
But like kind of open source, E. or all I on on monolithic.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:42.000
How companies are big talk I don't know what to call that but I also don't think that it's it's markedly against that like a student gonna come in and be like i'm super into volunteer and

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:56.000
i'd be like all right that's weird okay you know like I don't think it explicitly rejects like be an imposing ideology or an ideology that's using creative code for a vocational

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
setting. but the my experience with the group has it's it kind of leans in that direction.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I don't know. Is there a terminology for that those those sorts of ideas?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Yeah, I mean, I think open source as an attitude is definitely something that I was thinking about from the beginning.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:24.000
But I like what you're saying about this second piece which is like that, like an approach to how we approach, or it's like an approach to ideas that like we want.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.000
If someone comes in with an opposing idea. where the the thinking is like, let's talk about it like Why are you like, Tell us what's interesting to you about that.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Or how you're thinking about that and like maybe we disagree. but we're interested to know where you're coming from.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Like let's hear opposing like a dialectical approach. I guess is what you'd call it whoa That's that's a good way of thinking that's that's a value Oh, I don't know

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:03.000
how to describe, like, not task oriented as a as a value, or like a component of the manifesto.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Yeah, I've been saying like process oriented before I was saying like process prep little project based.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:43.000
But I think it's. more process. I wouldn't say it's project-based - process like as as opposed to project base Wow! yeah, How because I feel like there's a difference between like these

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:54.000
are the there's like 3 parts maybe there's like these are the things that we we advocate for.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And then there's like you know like open source or cooperation, and then, or maybe corporate, I don't know there's like the things we advocate for. and then there's the values behind them that are the reason

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:21.000
we advocate for them and then there's the how those get put into practice in front of them like, what does that look like when it plays out? We flip like the first 2.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
But yeah, those are the 3 3 sections.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
The thinking behind it. Then there's the So you said it the values.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
And then, yeah, the the 3 I forgot the term I just like totally forgotten.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
No, it's helpful to hear it from you too, because like this.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
It really is a group like I stuff i've been thinking about from the beginning.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:58.000
But everybody's brought their own life to it and it's really helpful to hear it from other perspectives, and to like put other language to it.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
So like. Our conversation is very similar, but also totally different from mine.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000
With Catherine. so it's it's really useful so feel free to repeat like reiterate like.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I hope you plan on keeping up like the creative code practice, like as you continue or like in a community like you're kind of a cornerstone of this one.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
So I hope you like. continue to be 7 or more people.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Thank you. I I feel like I definitely have to, just for my own practice, like I was reading the other interview, editing it down, and I was like, Wow, This is like a real thing.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Like it feels momentous like, actually like what it he made a real legitimate thing.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Yeah, you actually did. So a legit impactful thing. Yeah. Yeah.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And it really has had an impact on me, too, like as much or more than everybody else.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
So that is of so much like that means so much to me.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:17.000
That I was joking at the beginning, like don't let this become my dissertation, because, like teaching used to take up so much of my life in a way that I hated because it was like planning and getting nervous for doing

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:31.000
lectures. but this mode feels like the kind. of teaching that just feeds my soul and feeds my creative practice. and it's just so much more affirming and energy giving.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Then, and if it does feel like the core of like that I Guess that's what I mean is like the thinking behind the like.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:58.000
The values, and then the the whatever the thing, is in the middle that I can't think of the word for the I forgot it was good where you will see it, and then the like how those get enacted.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:14.000
But like I mean i'm thinking of like dot or my own experience, like I feel like a lot of the the values or a lot of the kind of like ideologies that I would try was trying to hold on to and be a lot

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:26.000
harder for me to hold on to without code collect it, even Dodgy, who's like he was confronted with opportunities to profit immensely off of nfts, but decided not to because of code collect because like

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
you know, when he was thinking about these ideas, he could see other people who are also using code in the creative manner.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:45.000
So it like actively shaped the ethics of of like students who have a lot of power or not students, but like individuals who are like who have exceptional power with their.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
So I think I can see creative code collective as kind of like a way to like reinforce ethics.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Yeah, and without imposing them like, no one went to Daji and said, What you're doing is wrong.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:21.000
We said, Oh, like it sounds like you're having mixed feelings about this like let's talk about it, or he was very vocal about, but it was like we were all interested in, it and had dynamic conversations around

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:33.000
it it was never like. don't do that what are you doing but definitely a space to hold like all the possibilities around it which I really appreciate.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:42.000
And i've been careful not to I mean I know you and I have gotten into like some heated conversations which I really enjoy.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
But we're I think we're always there's a like a lot of respect.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Yeah there to hold all of the opposing ideas yeah So I guess that's like the like.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
The dialectical is the value and yeah i'm stuck on like what to call those things.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:12.000
But I it's interesting how that plays out What would you I have like to couple more questions 3 more questions.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
I guess so. we'll just like tell you what they all are, and then we can like chat about them in general.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000
One is like, Do you have a favorite like what do you like about co- collective like?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Do you have a favorite memory or moment from it? What would you change about it?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Feel free to get unrealistic. No budgets or limits or like you won't it's Okay, if you insult me.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And then what would you take? What do you take with you from your experiences?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
How has it changed you, or what you make or what you'll do

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I have 2 favorite memories. I think they're both like one in recent memory.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I loved editing that 3 Js scene with autumn.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Like. I love being able to like have group input and just also I was as before I was trying to communicate threejs knowledge, and I've been struggling to get it out of my head.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
But to like, for some reason like seeing it in the group setting.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:20.000
It was like a really fulfilling, experienced like a teeth like a teaching moment where I could, I could communicate a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:31.000
There was also I forget her name, but this was pre-pandemic, but it was a bigner student to a trouble with code, and I think it was Catherine. But I forget.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
It was just like being able to see, like the the mentorship between between people.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:43.000
That was a really powerful thing for me to see that, like Catherine was helping her.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Yeah, , yeah, forgot who was helping. But, like I remember seeing seeing that kind of like troubleshooting, debugging.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
That was really important for me to see as far as where i'd like to see this.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I'd love to see this outside of the university setting I wish this existed for urban professionals.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
I feel like not all of my silicon valley friends would partake in something like this, because they're so burnt out on code.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
But I'm sure there's a lot of people that are still wanting to have this conversation wanting to office like in my career right now.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I need to like start making content so like it's like I start on the Tiktok dry and start on the Instagram ground.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I'm sure a lot of people in tech are starting to do this.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:42.000
So this could be a really helpful day before kind of the content Creator, as a like, you know, like the tech content Creator or the creative code Content Creator can see this be having being very fulfilling and helpful for that kind

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
of community. What What would that look like? I What would that mean?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Like that you come together as a community and then you same thing What are you working on?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:06.000
What's up, what's on your mind you do a round circle, And then you you talk about the the problems you have in common, whatever code thing that you're trying to solve that's really difficult but like that same kind of structure and I think it would

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:16.000
lend itself to the same values, because it's not it's not like directly vocational in the same way like working a company would be, I see.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Oh, and then they that it wouldn't be like they go have those conversations in the content they're creating.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:35.000
But it'd be like as they're troubleshooting the content that they're creating or like people who are making content like they'll have a you know bases of software or like aud is starting to make more

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:44.000
content, and that's helping his music career. so I can imagine how creative code has helped him, just as like an ability for him to touch grass this week.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:52.000
It would help. I try to communicate it this has a function that could have a lot of professionals.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:08.000
As well. Yeah, that's, interesting it also was just give me the thought of like, what would it look like to have these common kinds of conversation over social media's bases, or would that be viable?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Or would that just be duplicating other? It could.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.000
You could do it at a coffee shop. you could probably do it and gather town, I mean, I i'm kind of fascinated on virtual meetings.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:29.000
For some reason 101 isn't that bad but like gather, Yeah, I just like I would so much rather be person that I'm driving is such a pain.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So like, yeah, I know i'm like you want me to go to a thing in a place.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
But then also Oh, my eyeballs i'll have cake oh, no, not you!

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Not you the bakery gave it to me for phrase. What?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Why, oh, Jesse's very I don't know it's a squad of all in bakery, and they just love me.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
And gave me this beautiful cake. Yeah.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:02.000
But oh, there was a third question: Oh, yeah, what will you take with you?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:21.000
From your experiences I mean it's more of like what won't like I what I think this it's almost like an opportunity cost like if creative code wasn't there I would be working for palantine or something right now like i'd be full like using this

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:35.000
mind towards just I wouldn't even call it destruction but I would have lost a lot like I know that I I've been gifted with like, or just just been privileged to have a lot of technical ability, and i'd

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:49.000
be using in a very, very different manner, if it wasn't for a code collective like I I definitely think that like it has kept a certain ethnic, ethical leading or like a political meaning I don't know how to describe that

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
the family of values, that creative code, collective espouses.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
But like a huge amount of like empathy or a criticality that has remained.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:06.000
That's that's what i'm taking with me and that's what I will keep, and I hope to replicate it in some form.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But yeah, yeah, if you still have time i'd love to hear a bit more about how you would imagine replicating that, or like what your goal like.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Yeah, so can you tell me more about that i'm heading to Santa Cruz.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:28.000
I'm not i'm not quite sure what the responsibilities are what the live with the school is gonna be entirely. It was cool.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I got to meet the 2 of my peers in my lab.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I guess the Professor, that i'm working for like got like a bigger like not just one student, but 3.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:51.000
So that's gonna be kind of cool yeah mit media lab person that's gonna be like my peer and then like another web deaf person which i'm stoked about because I love what i've been a lot But I do think that there's a lot to

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
be like there's a lot like santa cruz as a school has a lot of game dev kids just like Usc.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000
It's the third I think I forgot like ranking wise but it's a little bit like they have a lot less resources than you Usc.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:12.000
But talking to those students. they're a lot just a small sample, but I've also talked to a ucs the alumni at at Usc.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Right now. they have a lot more of kind of the enchantment wick game, development, or game design than I've seen in Usc. students.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
So. i'm hoping that if I were to like gather a group.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Maybe it'll also be called the creative code collective if that's okay, or it's just the same chapter or the same thing.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:47.000
But to take to give infrastructure to that or to give space for that I don't know if the course load I know at Usc. it's a lot less for a lot of disciplines than the Uc system so

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:56.000
that will affect the the bandwidth of students to think about things critically, or to work on creative projects.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:07.000
So yeah, i'd like to like i'll have to like find a space like a consistent space to meet and see if I can gather the students interested in creative code.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
So definitely gonna be starting with like people interested in processing people interested in like generative art.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:25.000
I think those are like good good starting points to start It depends on the affordances of the space, and I get like a hardware maker space, and it could be the Arduino kids.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
I'll also have to tap into what the existing student organizations are like as well.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Yeah, Yeah, that's awesome i'm super excited to hear what's gonna happen?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:48.000
How that's you know how that comes together so I hope you keep me updated, and also like you know, if we're gonna continue doing this next year that there's an opportunity to both to keep you in the code collective.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Family the Usc. code collective family, but to link up to the Santa Cruz code collective family as it's forming. Yeah,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Well to like to spread it right I mean i'd Imagine you could like, even in la like there's there's the opportunity to take these collectives and put them in in a bunch of places like you could build it pick your network I don't know if that's like an ambition of yours but this I get

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
in. I see it. I definitely see the the like, the potential for this to spread and have a lot of power.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah. And if you wanted I don't know if it makes sense like if you wanted to bring them in, if you want everybody on like a shared discord or separate spaces, or like, just to link people up like, we should definitely talk more

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
about what structures would make sense once you get a feel for yeah, the culture there.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Yeah, I mean one mask like did like the kids operate on discord so well.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:53.000
So like maybe just scorpion I do I do think it'd be important to gather people in.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Person. Yeah. Oh, I think, in addition, yeah, the iii excited to see , I don't know.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Are we still on the record? hit you when I I can pause it for a minute.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I was not like, yeah let me turn this back on for a second, because I had a question with Zoom.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Okay, we're back. What if you were now since you are starting a code collective.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:29.000
You're basically my target audience for this projects. like what would you want to see in a guidebook to this like, What do you?

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:37.000
I mean you you already know, because you're inside It But like what needs to be in this book programmatic ritual.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
So it. Have you heard of like the ancient sumerians or like this book?

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
What this book's so good it's it's no crash.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
But new stuff is yeah I haven't read it so many people have told me to read it pretty good.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
It's pretty good it's like it's pretty pump out.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I don't know it's it's like fun site it's fun.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
It's like actually a fun book, but in it it has this huge.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:10.000
It's not the only book on my bookshelf that's obsessed with this, but I don't know why, but like I feel like I'm just seeing in the narrative law about like Sumerian language

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
and Samarian that they like. It was kind of maybe the birth of human consciousness.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:22.000
So they had a radically different human consciousness, but they would kind of like, keep all of their writing in a certain temple.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:33.000
And suppose you were to become a bread maker, you would go to the Temple either like priestess or priest, would like, give you the programmatic instructions for like how to do bread. so like the whole society was

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000
codified and edited from that temple and everyone would just follow these writings, and that's how society would keep going.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I think there's some like inkin civilizations. but they would like this exists in a lot of things. So what I would look for in a manifesto is maybe a practical guide to setting it up. The values. And you know, these things could shift based on the circumstance, because I imagine there could be like a creative code collective in, like, Austin, Texas, with very very different values and aims and and people working on different stuff but still people benefiting from a lot of the same weird <<WHA?>> it that we would do so. that's such an interesting question, though.

>Yeah, I mean so I agree. So right now, the structure is there's a manifesto and a practical guide. But they're kind of blurring because the practical guide is like we bring snacks. We you know it is, kind of like the ritual but it's also like there's a lot of values just so stuff in the practical guide, and it's very loose like our structure. they're very embedded in one another and I do wonder like could could there be a a wyoming right wing code collective that's like we are a you know. gray hat, red hat, hacker, I mean I don't know like so like one thing is like you could emphasize radical openness right That's something that you know I could imagine I don't know.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
I argue if I got what conservatives but like they're like they're not scary. They're also like they they also have cannot share the same values like radical openness or welcoming. You could I think there's a value set that you could encompass that.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:43.000
That would that would do it yeah and I I mean But there's a part of me Yeah, there's a part of me that's like these values are not left or right per se.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000
They want to capture, because I can imagine a bunch of right wingers also liking open source for very different reasons.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Right, a creative code, collective facility like having the same kind of like, I don't know like tech political algocratic leaning like, I don't know how to describe that set.

>Yeah, right? But would it also emphasize like care? And the way that we like look after each other. And I think that that should be in there.

Yeah, so care is a component looking after each other as a component like helping is is like a component. 

>Yeah, it's hard hard to think of it's hard to imagine. those in a in a space with a different, completely different aim, though like would would these values lead to different comes and political.

I think I think I think like the core, the core set, or like what like whatever like underneath this gathering, and how it operates, and how it has helped people like, I think that could be in so many circumstances.

>Yeah. And would you need like lot more hard and fast practical tips like what kinds of things would that look like? Would you need to get more practical than that? 

I think that the show Intel routine is a good one, or like kind of the Round Robin. What are you working on? what's up like that has been good sharing of resources has been good. 

What I wish that like that was that that had been augmented, I think, like the kind of like commute, like, or even before, when you were just putting everything into this massive document that was good right so like that kind of like scribe as a as a thing, as another thing that can be codified.

>I forgot about that. That was huge. Yeah, that was huge.

It was huge, so that's that's why it's It's like interesting, because it's you you're all you are like like establishing kind of a system right of like the way people work or like labor in a way. right So it is like a collective it's like How does it? But it's not like as if we were like an aquarium Communist collective because it's not like we have to farm to survive it's it is, **it is more like a salon, like a French salon where it's like, Oh, let's like hang out eat, and talk about code. So I don't know yeah but it's of consequence in these meetings. People do make huge strides in their projects, or come up like solve crazy problems. So I don't know how to it's hard to intend to capture, and distill what you've done in order to make that happen consistently.** Like we can. we can piece of like Oh, like this is one component or like this is what little brick it's like. What are all the necessary? You know What are the minimum bricks necessary for this house like?

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:15.000
>I don't know. That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out, and even like remembering what I did or like, which part. **That was always the question: What's the minimal structure necessary to make people feel like they have a container that is safe, and that gives them freedom to move? What's the foundation you need to have to facilitate, to have spaciousness. But you still need a foundation. You still need a a safe structure.**

**Yeah, I can describe it in terms of like what it's not, right? Like you've killed elitism pretty well. You've killed kind of a dynamic, a hierarchical dynamic. It's safe so there's no punitive for anything, any inefficiency or mistake.** So you've done that, so it's easy to describe it in terms of what it's not or point to like, Call it like <<CHECK>> a code call like I don't know like go group so software developers that have other systems. right? you can describe in terms of what it's not easily. Yeah. But yeah, to say, like, Okay, you you have a resource list. You have a weekly meeting, you have know, like all mistakes, are great mistakes, policy. You have I guess It's like these are good these are it's those enumerated. Yeah, like I you know there's a section of like all mistakes are like no mistake like no mistakes are I don't know

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Yeah, search Your memory is gone. I think the odd is like find my brain like actually like a side note like my eyes are going to screw up, anyways that we can't put out any research on that by the way.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000
So I was like looking at all the papers like Wow!

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Put out anything against big tech you get blockballed like instantly. and like they've known this for a while, like, you know, like they've been like headlines and and articles about this But it's like there's a lot

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
of homogeneity hobbies that I have.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Yeah, I mean, look what happened to timid who was like at the top of her game at Google, and it was like doing what her job described her to Do not bad.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Like i'm stating the obvious which you hired me to do. and i'm still getting blackball. It wasn't even that like that, like I don't even I don't know Maybe Maybe they just like just needed to free up

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.000
the Resources Corporation, you know. and then I just turned into like A.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I don't know yeah yeah what about your your Weren't you doing something with ocular vision?

00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Computer vision stuff last year. Oh, like I was working with a retinal surgeon.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Yeah, yeah, that was fascinating so like That's another example where there could be huge benefit.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So like Vr stuff, because the medical field could use just better data visualization in general.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:18.000
So just like putting it in. Vr might help someone a lot.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
There are a lot of cases where you need to see something in threed, because the twod diagram doesn't communicate much.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
So 2 doctors could look at. Oh, like it's this angle where this pathology is in a certain way.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:35.000
So there are there aren't I think there's like 2 things that academia and industry can agree on our good.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:44.000
One of them is education, because education helps big tech proliferate, and like education, is also kind of like like academia's.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Power comes from gatekeeping, so they can both like work on education in any circumstance, and be fine with it like it helps both.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:56:02.000
And then the other is the medical field, because If you well within as long as what you're doing helps increase the profit of an insurance company.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Then you want. So you need to find how does your research help people, and then also help an insurance company.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:28.000
And then it's a valid paper were you doing something, though, with that that training training to find for something in the in the data sets in the So that was just like a pure statistical thing which like they're still working on

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000
we had a lot of trouble getting the data out but we're fixing.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Okay, that's still ongoing that's under really interesting.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:42.000
It was a cool project Yeah, so i'm wondering if like if like, when you're when you when you get your like masters, or whatever or like.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I guess it's based on your advisor do you just have a lot.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Can you just start writing papers and putting them in journals like they might not be any good, because you know you have a advisor.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:58.000
But you could read like all the proceedings for a journal, and then like, and then make a paper.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Right. So Yeah, you could you could write papers now. it's just no one does cause it's hard, and they're not in.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:11.000
They're not in the environment like you don't have to have any Are they?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Give you submit them anonymously, or they no, they're always yeah.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
They're always based on your credential probably it depends on the venue.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Whether you know you're not probably not gonna get in like a I forget what the rankings are for the papers, for it's different for different fields, but like oh, so all my Santa Cruz degree not put

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
me on the same playing field as a Harvard person.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Probably not right. Oh, I mean, I think having that degree will.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:48.000
But I mean as soon as you're like you if you're doing research like anyone can submit a paper. There's no rule but like it should be based on the merits of the work that you're doing.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:07.000
But there's still like like could I make an alias, and like just like will the name count against me because there is implicit bias.

>I mean that's probably always true i'm never gonna say there's not implicit bias right. But yeah you could be publishing. You could be submitting thanks for publication now, as far as I know there's like, I see, some occasion rarely, but occasionally do see people published as like independent scholar, or like you know, like for their affiliation, but I just had an idea and wrote it. Yeah, I mean, I think it happens less in the sciences because usually people are working out of a lab need resources. So their research is part of a group. and groups are in academia, and people then have affiliations. 

Suppose you know, like I do research, and like, I find out that the headset is screwing up the eye in a very tangible way. and there's measurable evidence across a bunch of people you could submit that anonymously right will it get published. That's the other thing right? Yeah, you could submit it under an alias, Yeah, Interesting. Yeah, but I don't know if it's like worth using an academic platform to speak truth to power you know i'm not I don't think it's sort of that. I was like that would be a fantasy of mine when I was 3 years younger before a pandemic 

but like you're probably, you know, once you're part of Katherine's lab you're going to be publishing, like as soon as you're there or part of their publications, and you won't have PHD yet, but you'll be on their papers. 

>I met the peers there. They it's kind of funny like a seeing the attitudes of like the the people who are just beginning who have a lot of energy and they're super passionate, and then, like meeting people who are like fourth or fifth, or they're just like tired like. I met this person who was like in the first 2 years, like, you know, like check this out. This is my like ar glasses like check out this cool thing I was like yo that's sick, and then this like fourth year is like, yeah, like every May I try for SIGCHI. I don't get it, but it's fun to see that like you can see a very linear energy drop. 

>Oh, I wonder if i've come off that way, I met with one. I'm meeting with another new admit today. I met with one last week so bright.

>Oh, thank you so much for all of your answers with this is super helpful, and, like a lot of the language around it, to really like talk through, give different vocabulary to it, and like, get really concrete about like, what are the the foundational elements like Resource, list and a an in-person, regular cadence, and it is really helpful. to know that the checking like going around at the beginning and checking in doesn't feel stiff, but feels important. Yeah, okay, happy birthday. I'm so glad that you exist.

I'm very very grateful for you like I really really am.

>Oh, thank you so much i'm very grateful for you too. I feel like you're like the you know part of the heart of code collective, and I can't imagine it without you like It's becoming what it's been and it's gonna be strange next year.

But I feel like it, like you really helped bring it to life in a really special way. So thank you, like in amoeba, and then, or like one of those like cellular organisms.

And then you just like mitosis me to like another like like well, like phagocytosis, you and a little foot out into the world.
