Innovation and finding your own unique solutions have been pushed aside, easing us into lazy comfort. Together with designers, writers and artists from all over the world we want to go off grid for a breather and get out of our cozy pillows. Together we want to be nostalgic about a new web that has yet to be conjured by us and share new possibilities and viewpoints for a happier and more diverse time in front of and behind the screen. We envision a digital detox from the online anecdotes and how the internet should look and delve deep into new narrations that break up with our templated reality.

  {"id":"abdallaGreyHoodieProject2021","abstract":"As governmental bodies rely on academics' expert advice to shape policy regarding Artificial Intelligence, it is important that these academics not have conflicts of interests that may cloud or bias their judgement. Our work explores how Big Tech can actively distort the academic landscape to suit its needs. By comparing the well-studied actions of another industry (Big Tobacco) to the current actions of Big Tech we see similar strategies employed by both industries. These strategies enable either industry to sway and influence academic and public discourse. We examine the funding of academic research as a tool used by Big Tech to put forward a socially responsible public image, influence events hosted by and decisions made by funded universities, influence the research questions and plans of individual scientists, and discover receptive academics who can be leveraged. We demonstrate how Big Tech can affect academia from the institutional level down to individual researchers. Thus, we believe that it is vital, particularly for universities and other institutions of higher learning, to discuss the appropriateness and the tradeoffs of accepting funding from Big Tech, and what limitations or conditions should be put in place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdalla","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Abdalla","given":"Moustafa"}],"citation-key":"abdallaGreyHoodieProject2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society","DOI":"10.1145/3461702.3462563","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,21]]},"page":"287-297","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Grey Hoodie Project: Big Tobacco, Big Tech, and the threat on academic integrity","title-short":"The Grey Hoodie Project","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13676"},
  {"id":"abebeRolesComputingSocial2020","abstract":"A recent normative turn in computer science has brought concerns about fairness, bias, and accountability to the core of the field. Yet recent scholarship has warned that much of this technical work treats problematic features of the status quo as fixed, and fails to address deeper patterns of injustice and inequality. While acknowledging these critiques, we posit that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems --- roles whose value can be recognized even from a perspective that aspires toward fundamental social change. In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Abebe","given":"Rediet"},{"family":"Barocas","given":"Solon"},{"family":"Kleinberg","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Raghavan","given":"Manish"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"David G."}],"citation-key":"abebeRolesComputingSocial2020","collection-title":"FAT* '20","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3351095.3372871","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6936-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,27]]},"page":"252–260","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Roles for computing in social change","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3351095.3372871"},

  {"id":"ademaLivingBooks350","abstract":"Reimagining the scholarly book as living and collaborative—not as commodified and essentialized, but in all its dynamic materiality.\n                In this book, Janneke Adema proposes that we reimagine the scholarly book as a living and collaborative project—not as linear, bound, and fixed, but fluid, remixed, and liquid, a space for experimentation. She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality.Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Adema","given":"Janneke"}],"citation-key":"ademaLivingBooks350","ISBN":"978-0-262-04602-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["350"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Living Books","type":"book","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/living-books"},

  {"id":"ademaUnrulyGesturesSeven2019","abstract":"Unruly gestures presents a hybrid performative intervention by means of video, text, and still images. With this experimental essay we aspire to break down various preconceptions about reading/writing gestures. Breaking away from a narrative that sees these gestures foremost as passive entities – as either embodiments of pure subjective intentionality, or as bodily movements shaped and controlled by media technologies (enabling specific sensory engagements with texts) – we aim to reappraise them. Indeed, in this essay we identify numerous dominant narratives that relate to gestural agency, to the media-specificity of gestures, and to their (linear) historicity, naturalness and humanism. This essay disrupts these preconceptions, and by doing so, it unfolds an alternative genealogy of ‘unruly gestures.’ These are gestures that challenge gestural conditioning through particular media technologies, cultural power structures, hegemonic discourses, and the biopolitical self. We focus on reading/writing gestures that have disrupted gestural hegemonies and material-discursive forms of gestural control through time and across media. Informed by Tristan Tzara’s cut-up techniques, where through the gesture of cutting the Dadaists subverted established traditions of authorship, intentionality, and linearity, this essay has been cut-up into seven semi-autonomous cine-paragraphs (accessible in video and print). Each of these cine-paragraphs confronts specific gestural preconceptions while simultaneously showcasing various unruly gestures.\n*Please note that the link http://www.cultureunbound.ep.liu.se/v11/a11/unruly_gestures.mp4 referred to in the article is no longer accessible, but the video is available for viewing under the link to the PDF on this page or at https://cultureunbound.ep.liu.se/article/view/255/2577.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Adema","given":"Janneke"},{"family":"Kuc","given":"Kamila"}],"citation-key":"ademaUnrulyGesturesSeven2019","container-title":"Culture Unbound","DOI":"10.3384/cu.2000.1525.2019111190","ISSN":"2000-1525","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,12]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2019 Janneke Adema, Kamila Kuc","number":"1","page":"190-208","source":"cultureunbound.ep.liu.se","title":"Unruly Gestures: Seven Cine-Paragraphs on Reading/Writing Practices in our Post-Digital Condition","title-short":"Unruly Gestures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://cultureunbound.ep.liu.se/article/view/255","volume":"11"},

Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.\n\nThe Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.\n\n2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic:\n\n\n\n\nA High-Level Look\nLet’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box.

  {"id":"alpaydinMachineLearningNew2016","abstract":"A concise overview of machine learning―computer programs that learn from data―which underlies applications that include recommendation systems, face recognition, and driverless cars.Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition―as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning―the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge―has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications.Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty. Alpaydin then considers some future directions for machine learning and the new field of “data science,” and discusses the ethical and legal implications for data privacy and security.","author":[{"family":"Alpaydin","given":"Ethem"}],"citation-key":"alpaydinMachineLearningNew2016","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-52951-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,7]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"230","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Amazon","title":"Machine Learning: The New AI","title-short":"Machine Learning","type":"book"},

  {"id":"amaroMachineLearningSociogeny2019","abstract":"This thesis examines the relationship between machine learning, sociogeny, and race. Machine learning is understood here as an epistemic process that organises data into discrete spatio- temporal classifications. Following Kara Keeling, the thesis defines spatio-temporal classification as a coordinate that makes the racial imaginary possible, while itself eluding representation. Lastly, sociogeny, as defined by Frantz Fanon, is a ‘sociodiagnostic’ phenomenon that emerges at the ontological limit of the episteme, resulting in the discursive exclusion of the lived reality of racialised individuals. \n\nThe thesis argues that an immediate parallel can be drawn between the scientific production of knowledge, as established truths, and perceptions of otherness. While historically science and technology have worked to support racial classification, contemporary machine leaning algorithms have been shown, even unwittingly, to replicate existing race relations. The thesis contends that racial classification in machine learning is symptomatic of a wider logics of pathology, as well as enumeration — which, if taken as a spatio-temporal coordinate, arrests self-actualisation. By aligning machine learning with Fanon’s notion of sociogeny, and the spatio-temporal coordinate, the thesis challenges views of a causal relationship between classification, racial position and psychic fragmentation. Instead, the thesis argues for an alternative view of sociogeny as a non-linear process, always-already in excess of racial perception under the conditions of duress. Ultimately, the thesis investigates machine learning as a methodological space to re-articulate the spatio-temporal coordinate and, in turn, affirmative black psychic generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Amaro","given":"Ramon"}],"citation-key":"amaroMachineLearningSociogeny2019","genre":"doctoral","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,31]]},"language":"eng","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","number-of-pages":"274","publisher":"Goldsmiths, University of London","source":"research.gold.ac.uk","title":"Machine Learning, Sociogeny, and the Substance of Race","type":"thesis","URL":"https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/26850/"},

The interface has moved from office into culture, with devices, apps, the cloud, and data streams as new cultural platforms. In The Metainterface, Christian Ulrik Andersen and Søren Bro Pold examine the relationships between art and interfaces, tracing the interface's disruption of everyday cultural practices. They present a new interface paradigm of cloud services, smartphones, and data capture, and examine how particular art forms―including net art, software art, and electronic literature―seek to reflect and explore this paradigm.Andersen and Pold argue that despite attempts to make the interface disappear into smooth access and smart interaction, it gradually resurfaces; there is a metainterface to the displaced interface. Art can help us see this; the interface can be an important outlet for aesthetic critique. Andersen and Pold describe the “semantic capitalism” of a metainterface industry that captures user behavior; the metainterface industry's disruption of everyday urban life, changing how the city is read, inhabited, and organized; the ways that the material displacement of the cloud affects the experience of the interface; and the potential of designing with an awareness of the language and grammar of interfaces.","author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Christian Ulrik"},{"family":"Pold","given":"Søren Bro"}],"citation-key":"andersenMetainterfaceArtPlatforms2018","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London, England","ISBN":"978-0-262-03794-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,27]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"248","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London, England","source":"Amazon","title":"The Metainterface: The Art of Platforms, Cities, and Clouds","title-short":"The Metainterface","type":"book"},

In Technologies of Vision, Steve Anderson argues that visual culture and the methods developed to study it have much to teach us about today's digital culture; but first we must examine the historically entangled relationship between data and images. Anderson starts from the supposition that there is no great divide separating pre- and post-digital culture. Rather than creating an insular field of new and inaccessible discourse, he argues, it is more productive to imagine that studying \"the digital\" is coextensive with critical models – especially the politics of seeing and knowing – developed for understanding \"the visual.\"Anderson's investigation takes on an eclectic array of examples ranging from virtual reality, culture analytics, and software art to technologies for computer vision, face recognition, and photogrammetry. Mixing media archaeology with software studies, Anderson mines the history of technology for insight into both the politics of data and the pleasures of algorithms. He proposes a taxonomy of modes that describe the functional relationship between data and images in the domains of space, surveillance and data visualization. At stake in all three are tensions between the totalizing logic of data and the unruly chaos of images.","author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Steve F."}],"citation-key":"andersonTechnologiesVisionWar2017","ISBN":"978-0-262-03701-3","issued":{"literal":"-10-13 2017"},"language":"en","publisher":"MIT Press","title":"Technologies of Vision: The War Between Data and Images","type":"book"},

The results revealed that participants who engaged in compassionate thinking and cognitive reappraisal reported signiﬁcantly lower levels of negative emotions compared to those in the responsibility reattribution and control conditions. Furthermore, results of hierarchical regression analyses suggested that habitual use of self-compassion reduced negative emotions in all conditions.

  {"id":"asanoPASSImageNetReplacement2021","abstract":"Computer vision has long relied on ImageNet and other large datasets of images sampled from the Internet for pretraining models. However, these datasets have ethical and technical shortcomings, such as containing personal information taken without consent, unclear license usage, biases, and, in some cases, even problematic image content. On the other hand, state-of-the-art pretraining is nowadays obtained with unsupervised methods, meaning that labelled datasets such as ImageNet may not be necessary, or perhaps not even optimal, for model pretraining. We thus propose an unlabelled dataset PASS: Pictures without humAns for Self-Supervision. PASS only contains images with CC-BY license and complete attribution metadata, addressing the copyright issue. Most importantly, it contains no images of people at all, and also avoids other types of images that are problematic for data protection or ethics. We show that PASS can be used for pretraining with methods such as MoCo-v2, SwAV and DINO. In the transfer learning setting, it yields similar downstream performances to ImageNet pretraining even on tasks that involve humans, such as human pose estimation. PASS does not make existing datasets obsolete, as for instance it is insufficient for benchmarking. However, it shows that model pretraining is often possible while using safer data, and it also provides the basis for a more robust evaluation of pretraining methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Asano","given":"Yuki M."},{"family":"Rupprecht","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Zisserman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Vedaldi","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"asanoPASSImageNetReplacement2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2109.13228","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,27]]},"language":"en","source":"arxiv.org","title":"PASS: An ImageNet replacement for self-supervised pretraining without humans","title-short":"PASS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13228v1"},

However, over the centuries, many inscriptions have been damaged to the point of illegibility, transported far from their original location and their date of writing is steeped in uncertainty. Here we present Ithaca, a deep neural network for the textual restoration, geographical attribution and chronological attribution of ancient Greek inscriptions. Ithaca is designed to assist and expand the historian’s workflow. The architecture of Ithaca focuses on collaboration, decision support and interpretability. While Ithaca alone achieves 62% accuracy when restoring damaged texts, the use of Ithaca by historians improved their accuracy from 25% to 72%, confirming the synergistic effect of this research tool. Ithaca can attribute inscriptions to their original location with an accuracy of 71% and can date them to less than 30 years of their ground-truth ranges, redating key texts of Classical Athens and contributing to topical debates in ancient history. This research shows how models such as Ithaca can unlock the cooperative potential between artificial intelligence and historians, transformationally impacting the way that we study and write about one of the most important periods in human history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Assael","given":"Yannis"},{"family":"Sommerschield","given":"Thea"},{"family":"Shillingford","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Bordbar","given":"Mahyar"},{"family":"Pavlopoulos","given":"John"},{"family":"Chatzipanagiotou","given":"Marita"},{"family":"Androutsopoulos","given":"Ion"},{"family":"Prag","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Freitas","given":"Nando","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"assaelRestoringAttributingAncient2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04448-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7900","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"7900","page":"280-283","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Restoring and attributing ancient texts using deep neural networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04448-z","volume":"603"},

  {"id":"audryArtAgeMachine2021","abstract":"An examination of machine learning art and its practice in new media art and music. Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art.  Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.","author":[{"family":"Audry","given":"Sofian"}],"citation-key":"audryArtAgeMachine2021","ISBN":"978-0-262-36710-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,23]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"215","publisher":"MIT Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Art in the Age of Machine Learning","type":"book"},

  {"id":"baeza-yatesQualityefficiencyTradeoffsMachine2017","abstract":"As the amount of available digital documents keeps growing rapidly, extracting useful information from them has become a major challenge. Data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning are powerful techniques that can be used together to deal with this problem. Depending on the task at hand, there are many different approaches that can be used. The methods available are continuously improved, but not all of them have been tested and compared in a set of coherent problems using supervised machine learning algorithms. For example, what happens to the quality of the methods if we increase the training data size from, say, 100 MB to over 1 GB? Moreover, are quality gains worth it when the rate of data processing diminishes? Can we trade quality for time efficiency and recover the quality loss by just being able to process more data? We attempt to answer these questions in a general way for text processing tasks, considering the trade-offs involving training data size, learning time, and quality obtained. For this, we propose a performance trade-off framework and apply it to three important tasks: Named Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis and Document Classification. These problems were also chosen because they have different levels of object granularity: words, paragraphs, and documents. For each problem, we selected several supervised machine learning algorithms and we evaluated the trade-offs of them on large publicly available data sets (news, reviews, patents). To explore these trade-offs, we use different data subsets of increasing size ranging from 50 MB to several GB. For the last two tasks, we also consider similar algorithms with two different data sets and two evaluation techniques, to study their impact on the resulting trade-offs. We find that the results do not change significantly and that most of the time the best algorithms are the ones with fastest processing time. However, we also show that the results for small data (say less than 100 MB) are different from the results for big data and in those cases the best algorithm is much harder to determine.","author":[{"family":"Baeza-Yates","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Liaghat","given":"Zeinab"}],"citation-key":"baeza-yatesQualityefficiencyTradeoffsMachine2017","container-title":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","DOI":"10.1109/BigData.2017.8258006","event-title":"2017 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"page":"897-904","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Quality-efficiency trade-offs in machine learning for text processing","type":"paper-conference"},

This paper aims to help address documentation debt for BookCorpus, a popular text dataset for training large language models. Notably, researchers have used BookCorpus to train OpenAI's GPT-N models and Google's BERT models, even though little to no documentation exists about the dataset's motivation, composition, collection process, etc. We offer a preliminary datasheet that provides key context and information about BookCorpus, highlighting several notable deficiencies. In particular, we find evidence that (1) BookCorpus likely violates copyright restrictions for many books, (2) BookCorpus contains thousands of duplicated books, and (3) BookCorpus exhibits significant skews in genre representation. We also find hints of other potential deficiencies that call for future research, including problematic content, potential skews in religious representation, and lopsided author contributions. While more work remains, this initial effort to provide a datasheet for BookCorpus adds to growing literature that urges more careful and systematic documentation for machine learning datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bandy","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Vincent","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"bandyAddressingDocumentationDebt2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2105.05241","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2105.05241","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Addressing \"Documentation Debt\" in Machine Learning Research: A Retrospective Datasheet for BookCorpus","title-short":"Addressing \"Documentation Debt\" in Machine Learning Research","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05241"},

  {"id":"banksRaceRhetoricTechnology2006","abstract":"In this book Adam Banks uses the concept of the Digital Divide as a metonym for America's larger racial divide, in an attempt to figure out what meaningful access for African Americans to technologies and the larger American society can or should mean. He argues that African American rhetorical traditions--the traditions of struggle for justice and equitable participation in American society--exhibit complex and nuanced ways of understanding the difficulties inherent in the attempt to navigate through the seemingly impossible contradictions of gaining meaningful access to technological systems with the good they seem to make possible, and at the same time resisting the exploitative impulses that such systems always seem to present.Banks examines moments in these rhetorical traditions of appeals, warnings, demands, and debates to make explicit the connections between technological issues and African Americans' equal and just participation in American society. He shows that the big questions we must ask of our technologies are exactly the same questions leaders and lay people from Martin Luther King to Malcolm X to slave quilters to Critical Race Theorists to pseudonymous chatters across cyberspace have been asking all along. According to Banks the central ethical questions for the field of rhetoric and composition are technology access and the ability to address questions of race and racism. He uses this book to imagine what writing instruction, technology theory, literacy instruction, and rhetorical education can look like for all of us in a new century.Just as Race, Rhetoric, and Technology: Searching for Higher Ground is a call for a new orientation among those who study and profess African American rhetoric, it is also a call for those in the fields that make up mainstream English Studies to change their perspectives as well.

We observe that the generative behavior of diffusion models is not strongly dependent on the choice of image degradation, and in fact an entire family of generative models can be constructed by varying this choice. Even when using completely deterministic degradations (e.g., blur, masking, and more), the training and test-time update rules that underlie diffusion models can be easily generalized to create generative models. The success of these fully deterministic models calls into question the community's understanding of diffusion models, which relies on noise in either gradient Langevin dynamics or variational inference, and paves the way for generalized diffusion models that invert arbitrary processes.

  {"id":"bassettAnticomputingProvisionalTaxonomy2022","abstract":"In this chapter anti-computing is introduced, being explored from two connected directions. First it is defined as a series of dissenting responses to computerization, and its social or cultural impacts which have arisen since the 1950s are identified. What these share is that that they refuse the powerful and teleologically inspired myth that computational progress automatically constitutes progress in general, or in common. Dissent takes heterogeneous forms, operates in different registers, and rarely fully succeeds, since digitalization continues to expand its reach globally and at expanding scales – but it persists and rearises, older arguments finding new salience in relation to developing events. Responding to this anti-computing is elaborated as a critical theoretical approach drawing on media archaeology, media theory, and media history, constituting a means through which computational dissent, found ‘on the ground’ or ‘in theory’ can be explored. In the final third of the chapter this approach begins to be operationalized; a series of provisional taxonomies of anti-computing being generated and briefly explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bassett","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"bassettAnticomputingProvisionalTaxonomy2022","container-title":"Anti-computing","ISBN":"978-1-5261-6072-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"language":"en_US","page":"1-33","publisher":"Manchester University Press","section":"Anti-computing","source":"www.manchesterhive.com","title":"Anti-computing: A provisional taxonomy","title-short":"Anti-computing","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.manchesterhive.com/display/9781526160720/9781526160720.00007.xml"},

  {"id":"beckTechnocratsImaginationArt2020","abstract":"\"TECHNOCRATS OF THE IMAGINATION traces the rise of collaborative art and technology labs in the U.S. from WWII to the present. Ryan Bishop and John Beck reveal the intertwined histories of the avant-garde art movement and the military-industrial complex, showing how radical pedagogical practices traveled from Germany's Bauhaus movement to the U.S. art world and interacted with government-funded military research and development in university laboratories. During the 1960s both media labs and studio labs leaned heavily on methods of interdisciplinary collaboration and the power of American modernity to model new modes of social organization. The book's chapters take up MIT's Center for Art, Science, and Technology, Bell Labs's E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology) Salon, and Los Angeles Museum of Art's Art + Technology Program. Their interconnected history illuminates how much of contemporary media culture and aesthetics depends on the historical relationship between military, corporate, and university actors. In light of revived interest in Black Mountain College and other 1960s art and technology labs, this book draws important connections between the contemporary art world and the militarized lab model of research that has dominated the sciences since the 1950s. The authors situate the rise of collaborative art and technology projects in the 1960s within John Dewey's ideology of scientific democracy, showing how leading thinkers from the Bauhaus movement in Germany immigrated to the U.S. and brought with them a Deweyan model for collaborative and interdisciplinary art and technology research. Over the course of the decade, the U.S. government increased funding to scientific research at university and private laboratories. Beck and Bishop investigate how various art and technology projects incorporated the collaborative and innovative interdisciplinarity of the avant-garde art movement with the corporate funding structure driven by the U.S. government's military and technoscientific interests. Finally, the authors consider the legacy of 1960s art and technology projects. During the 1970s and 80s, defense R&D funding was less motivated by a Cold War corporate state, and was instead restructured according to an entrepreneurial and neoliberal model. At the same time, funding in the art world also became increasingly financialized and globalized. Today's art and technology work happens collaboratively not because of an intellectual commitment to interdisciplinarity, but because of the precarity of the contemporary labor market. This book will interest students and scholars in art history and theory, media studies, history of technology, American studies, cultural studies, and critical university studies\"--","author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"John"},{"family":"Bishop","given":"Ryan"}],"call-number":"NX180.T4 B43 2020","citation-key":"beckTechnocratsImaginationArt2020","event-place":"Durham","ISBN":"978-1-4780-0595-7 978-1-4780-0660-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"229","publisher":"Duke University Press Books","publisher-place":"Durham","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Technocrats of the imagination: art, technology, and the military-industrial avant-garde","title-short":"Technocrats of the imagination","type":"book"},

  {"id":"benamaraIntroductionSpecialIssue2018","abstract":"Social media content is changing the way people interact with each other and share information, personal messages, and opinions about situations, objects, and past experiences. Most social media texts are short online conversational posts or comments that do not contain enough information for natural language processing (NLP) tools, as they are often accompanied by non-linguistic contextual information, including meta-data (e.g., the user’s profile, the social network of the user, and their interactions with other users). Exploiting such different types of context and their interactions makes the automatic processing of social media texts a challenging research task. Indeed, simply applying traditional text mining tools is clearly sub-optimal, as, typically, these tools take into account neither the interactive dimension nor the particular nature of this data, which shares properties with both spoken and written language. This special issue contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of these interactions to process social media data from a new perspective in discourse interpretation. This introduction first provides the necessary background to understand what context is from both the linguistic and computational linguistic perspectives, then presents the most recent context-based approaches to NLP for social media. We conclude with an overview of the papers accepted in this special issue, highlighting what we believe are the future directions in processing social media texts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Benamara","given":"Farah"},{"family":"Inkpen","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Taboada","given":"Maite"}],"citation-key":"benamaraIntroductionSpecialIssue2018","container-title":"Computational Linguistics","container-title-short":"Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1162/coli_a_00333","ISSN":"0891-2017","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,18]]},"page":"663-681","source":"MIT Press Journals","title":"Introduction to the Special Issue on Language in Social Media: Exploiting Discourse and Other Contextual Information","title-short":"Introduction to the Special Issue on Language in Social Media","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00333","volume":"44"},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.","author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"},{"family":"McMillan-Major","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Shmitchell","given":"Shmargaret"}],"citation-key":"benderDangersStochasticParrots2021","collection-title":"FAccT '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3442188.3445922","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8309-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"page":"610–623","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?","title-short":"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922"},

  {"id":"benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019","abstract":"From everyday apps to complex algorithms, Ruha Benjamin cuts through tech-industry hype to understand how emerging technologies can reinforce White supremacy and deepen social inequity. Benjamin argues that automation, far from being a sinister story of racist programmers scheming on the dark web, has the potential to hide, speed up, and deepen discrimination while appearing neutral and even benevolent when compared to the racism of a previous era. Presenting the concept of the “New Jim Code,” she shows how a range of discriminatory designs encode inequity by explicitly amplifying racial hierarchies; by ignoring but thereby replicating social divisions; or by aiming to fix racial bias but ultimately doing quite the opposite. Moreover, she makes a compelling case for race itself as a kind of technology, designed to stratify and sanctify social injustice in the architecture of everyday life. This illuminating guide provides conceptual tools for decoding tech promises with sociologically informed skepticism. In doing so, it challenges us to question not only the technologies we are sold but also the ones we ourselves manufacture.

The paper's goal is to build towards a common framework for data licensing akin to the licensing of open source software. Increased transparency and resolving conceptual ambiguities in existing licensing language are two noted benefits of the approach proposed in the paper. In parallel, such benefits may help foster fairer and more efficient markets for data through bringing about clearer tools and concepts that better define how data can be used in the fields of AI and ML. The paper's approach is summarized in a new family of data license language - \\textit{the Montreal Data License (MDL)}. Alongside this new license, the authors and their collaborators have developed a web-based tool to generate license language espousing the taxonomies articulated in this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Benjamin","given":"Misha"},{"family":"Gagnon","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Rostamzadeh","given":"Negar"},{"family":"Pal","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Yoshua"},{"family":"Shee","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"benjaminStandardizationDataLicenses2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,20]]},"number":"arXiv:1903.12262","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Towards Standardization of Data Licenses: The Montreal Data License","title-short":"Towards Standardization of Data Licenses","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12262"},

  {"id":"bennettAGENTICDESIGNEMERGENT2021","abstract":"The extractive economy of mass production has resulted in the design of a vast array of destructive technologies. Labor value is extracted from poorly paid workers; ecological value is stripped from nature, and social value extracted by the commodification of nearly every communication form we encounter. What alternative design approach might provide a more generative economy, one in which value is circulated in unalienated forms rather than extracted? With that end in mind, I propose agentic design (AD), a framework for allowing human, non-human, and social agencies to collaborate in an emergent process. The case study in this paper is focused on quilting, an artisanal design practice that has been tied to more egalitarian and sustainable lifeways (Kuhn, 2016). I begin with a discussion on how traditional quilting itself can be understood as an emergent process. I then examine how these attributes can be merged with computational capabilities in the context of underserved educational communities, and report on the design process that develops from these intersections. Together these domains indicate that agentic design can offer more than just hybridity; with the right guidance, it can offer pathways to a more just and generative future.","author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Audrey G"}],"citation-key":"bennettAGENTICDESIGNEMERGENT2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"AGENTIC DESIGN: AN EMERGENT APPROACH TO GENERATIVE JUSTICE","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"bernsteinEthicsSocietyReview2021","abstract":"Significance\n            Research fields that hold transformative possibilities for improving the human condition also raise risks of negative ethical and societal outcomes. These ethical and societal risks fall outside the purview of most research reviews. We introduce an iterative review process that draws these fields into reflection and mitigation of ethical and societal risks by conditioning access to grant funding on completion of the process. A 1-y evaluation of our approach with an artificial intelligence funding program at our university suggests that this approach is well-received by researchers and positively influenced the design of their research. This process has also generated lists of common risks and mitigation strategies, to provide scaffolding for future processes.\n          , \n            Researchers in areas as diverse as computer science and political science must increasingly navigate the possible risks of their research to society. However, the history of medical experiments on vulnerable individuals influenced many research ethics reviews to focus exclusively on risks to human subjects rather than risks to human society. We describe an Ethics and Society Review board (ESR), which fills this moral gap by facilitating ethical and societal reflection as a requirement to access grant funding: Researchers cannot receive grant funding from participating programs until the researchers complete the ESR process for their proposal. Researchers author an initial statement describing their proposed research’s risks to society, subgroups within society, and globally and commit to mitigation strategies for these risks. An interdisciplinary faculty panel iterates with the researchers to refine these risks and mitigation strategies. We describe a mixed-method evaluation of the ESR over 1 y, in partnership with an artificial intelligence grant program run by Stanford HAI. Surveys and interviews of researchers who interacted with the ESR found 100% (95% CI: 87 to 100%) were willing to continue submitting future projects to the ESR, and 58% (95% CI: 37 to 77%) felt that it had influenced the design of their research project. The ESR panel most commonly identified issues of harms to minority groups, inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research plan, dual use, and representation in datasets. These principles, paired with possible mitigation strategies, offer scaffolding for future research designs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Levi","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Magnus","given":"David"},{"family":"Rajala","given":"Betsy A."},{"family":"Satz","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Waeiss","given":"Charla"}],"citation-key":"bernsteinEthicsSocietyReview2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"beysolowiiWorkingRawText2018","abstract":"Those who approach NLP with the intention of applying deep learning are most likely immediately confronted with a simple question: How does a machine learning algorithm learn to interpret text data? Similar to the situations in which a feature set may have a categorical feature, we must perform some preprocessing. While the preprocessing we perform in NLP often is more involved than simply converting a categorical feature using label encoding, the principle is the same. We need to find a way to represent individual observations of texts as a row, and encode a static number of features, represented as columns, across all of these observations. As such, feature extraction becomes the most important aspect of text preprocessing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Beysolow II","given":"Taweh"}],"citation-key":"beysolowiiWorkingRawText2018","container-title":"Applied Natural Language Processing with Python : Implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Natural Language Processing","DOI":"10.1007/978-1-4842-3733-5_3","editor":[{"family":"Beysolow II","given":"Taweh"}],"event-place":"Berkeley, CA","ISBN":"978-1-4842-3733-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"43-75","publisher":"Apress","publisher-place":"Berkeley, CA","source":"Springer Link","title":"Working with Raw Text","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-3733-5_3"},

  {"id":"birchallShareveillanceSubjectivityOpen2016","abstract":"This article attempts to question modes of sharing and watching to rethink political subjectivity beyond that which is enabled and enforced by the current data regime. It identifies and examines a ‘shareveillant’ subjectivity: a form configured by the sharing and watching that subjects have to withstand and enact in the contemporary data assemblage. Looking at government open and closed data as case studies, this article demonstrates how ‘shareveillance’ produces an anti-political role for the public. In describing shareveillance as, after Jacques Rancière, a distribution of the (digital) sensible, this article posits a politico-ethical injunction to cut into the share and flow of data in order to arrange a more enabling assemblage of data and its affects. In order to interrupt shareveillance, this article borrows a concept from Édouard Glissant and his concern with raced otherness to imagine what a ‘right to opacity’ might mean in the digital context. To assert this right is not to endorse the individual subject in her sovereignty and solitude, but rather to imagine a collective political subjectivity and relationality according to the important question of what it means to ‘share well’ beyond the veillant expectations of the state.","author":[{"family":"Birchall","given":"Clare"}],"citation-key":"birchallShareveillanceSubjectivityOpen2016","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951716663965","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"English","page":"2053951716663965","title":"Shareveillance: Subjectivity between open and closed data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951716663965","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"birhaneAutomatingAmbiguityChallenges2022","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools increasingly permeate every possible social, political, and economic sphere; sorting, taxonomizing and predicting complex human behaviour and social phenomena. However, from fallacious and naive groundings regarding complex adaptive systems to datasets underlying models, these systems are beset by problems, challenges, and limitations. They remain opaque and unreliable, and fail to consider societal and structural oppressive systems, disproportionately negatively impacting those at the margins of society while benefiting the most powerful. The various challenges, problems and pitfalls of these systems are a hot topic of research in various areas, such as critical data/algorithm studies, science and technology studies (STS), embodied and enactive cognitive science, complexity science, Afro-feminism, and the broadly construed emerging field of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT). Yet, these fields of enquiry often proceed in silos. This thesis weaves together seemingly disparate fields of enquiry to examine core scientific and ethical challenges, pitfalls, and problems of AI. In this thesis I, a) review the historical and cultural ecology from which AI research emerges, b) examine the shaky scientific grounds of machine prediction of complex behaviour illustrating how predicting complex behaviour with precision is impossible in principle, c) audit large scale datasets behind current AI demonstrating how they embed societal historical and structural injustices, d) study the seemingly neutral values of ML research and put forward 67 prominent values underlying ML research, e) examine some of the insidious and worrying applications of computer vision research, and f) put forward a framework for approaching challenges, failures and problems surrounding ML systems as well as alternative ways forward.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Birhane","given":"Abeba"}],"citation-key":"birhaneAutomatingAmbiguityChallenges2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.04179","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,8]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.04179","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Automating Ambiguity: Challenges and Pitfalls of Artificial Intelligence","title-short":"Automating Ambiguity","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04179"},

The rise of these gargantuan datasets has given rise to formidable bodies of critical work that has called for caution while generating these large datasets. These address concerns surrounding the dubious curation practices used to generate these datasets, the sordid quality of alt-text data available on the world wide web, the problematic content of the CommonCrawl dataset often used as a source for training large language models, and the entrenched biases in large-scale visio-linguistic models (such as OpenAI's CLIP model) trained on opaque datasets (WebImageText). In the backdrop of these specific calls of caution, we examine the recently released LAION-400M dataset, which is a CLIP-filtered dataset of Image-Alt-text pairs parsed from the Common-Crawl dataset. We found that the dataset contains, troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of rape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other extremely problematic content.

Conclusions and implications Since the epistemological underpinnings of Bumble's design centre gender as the solitary axis of oppression, the authors argue that the app's infrastructure generates an ontological relationship between gender, sex, and sexuality that narrows the capacity to achieve its creators' stated social justice objectives.

Following that development, what concerns us in this article is the analysis of emotions from facial expressions using computer-based systems, in relation to which we critically investigate the use of theories of basic emotions. We explore in depth the company Affectiva’s attempts to translate, represent and schematize human emotions, as they raise a variety of problems and issues of uncertainty. We analyse the uncertainties concerning the processing of the human face ‘as image’ due to issues concerning temporality and static images as well as polyphony and modulations of the spectrum of expressions. One of our key arguments concerns the temporal character of human emotions, and we address how algorithmically regulated protocols of discretization may be said to prompt specific patterns of emotional responses and expressions based on an ideal of eliminating uncertainty. Through discussions via art pieces by Lauren McCarthy and Kyle McDonald, we question what happens when the protocols of computer systems start to perform aspects of emotional labour for us, making judgments by predicting adequate emotional responses based on the use of the strict metrics criticized in the article.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bjørnsten","given":"Thomas Bøgevald"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Mette-Marie Zacher"}],"citation-key":"bjornstenUncertaintiesFacialEmotion2017","container-title":"Digital Creativity","DOI":"10.1080/14626268.2017.1383271","ISSN":"1462-6268","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,2]]},"page":"297-307","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Uncertainties of facial emotion recognition technologies and the automation of emotional labour","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2017.1383271","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"BlackSoftwareInternet2019","abstract":"Activists, pundits, politicians, and the press frequently proclaim today's digitally mediated racial justice activism the new civil rights movement. As Charlton D. McIlwain shows in this book, the story of racial justice movement organizing online is much longer and varied than most people know. In fact, it spans nearly five decades and involves a varied group of engineers, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, journalists, and activists. But this is a history that is virtually unknown even in our current age of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Black Lives Matter. Beginning with the simultaneous rise of civil rights and computer revolutions in the 1960s, McIlwain, for the first time, chronicles the long relationship between African Americans, computing technology, and the Internet. In turn, he argues that the forgotten figures who worked to make black politics central to the Internet's birth and evolution paved the way for today's explosion of racial justice activism. From the 1960s to present, the book examines how computing technology has been used to neutralize the threat that black people pose to the existing racial order, but also how black people seized these new computing tools to build community, wealth, and wage a war for racial justice.Through archival sources and the voices of many of those who lived and made this history, Black Software centralizes African Americans' role in the Internet's creation and evolution, illuminating both the limits and possibilities for using digital technology to push for racial justice in the United States and across the globe.","citation-key":"BlackSoftwareInternet2019","event-place":"Oxford, New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-086384-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"number-of-pages":"312","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, New York","source":"Oxford University Press","title":"Black Software: The Internet & Racial Justice, from the AfroNet to Black Lives Matter","title-short":"Black Software","type":"book"},

  {"id":"blairInformationHistoricalCompanion2021","abstract":"A landmark history that traces the creation, management, and sharing of information through six centuries Thanks to modern technological advances, we now enjoy seemingly unlimited access to information. Yet how did information become so central to our everyday lives, and how did its processing and storage make our data-driven era possible? This volume is the first to consider these questions in comprehensive detail, tracing the global emergence of information practices, technologies, and more, from the premodern era to the present. With entries spanning archivists to algorithms and scribes to surveilling, this is the ultimate reference on how information has shaped and been shaped by societies. Written by an international team of experts, the book's inspired and original long- and short-form contributions reconstruct the rise of human approaches to creating, managing, and sharing facts and knowledge. Thirteen full-length chapters discuss the role of information in pivotal epochs and regions, with chief emphasis on Europe and North America, but also substantive treatment of other parts of the world as well as current global interconnections. More than 100 alphabetical entries follow, focusing on specific tools, methods, and concepts—from ancient coins to the office memo, and censorship to plagiarism. The result is a wide-ranging, deeply immersive collection that will appeal to anyone drawn to the story behind our modern mania for an informed existence. Tells the story of information’s rise from 1450 through to today Covers a range of eras and regions, including the medieval Islamic world, late imperial East Asia, early modern and modern Europe, and modern North America Includes 100 concise articles on wide-ranging topics: Concepts: data, intellectual property, privacy Formats and genres: books, databases, maps, newspapers, scrolls and rolls, social media People: archivists, diplomats and spies, readers, secretaries, teachers Practices: censorship, forecasting, learning, political reporting, translating Processes: digitization, quantification, storage and search Systems: bureaucracy, platforms, telecommunications Technologies: cameras, computers, lithography Provides an informative glossary, suggested further reading (a short bibliography accompanies each entry), and a detailed index Written by an international team of notable contributors, including Jeremy Adelman, Lorraine Daston, Devin Fitzgerald, John-Paul Ghobrial, Lisa Gitelman, Earle Havens, Randolph C.

We further find that these papers' proposed quantitative techniques for measuring or mitigating \"bias\" are poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage with the relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing \"bias\" in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of \"bias\"---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements---and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Blodgett","given":"Su Lin"},{"family":"Barocas","given":"Solon"},{"family":"Daumé III","given":"Hal"},{"family":"Wallach","given":"Hanna"}],"citation-key":"blodgettLanguageTechnologyPower2020","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2005.14050","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,29]]},"number":"arXiv:2005.14050","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Language (Technology) is Power: A Critical Survey of \"Bias\" in NLP","title-short":"Language (Technology) is Power","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14050"},
  {"id":"blodgettResponsibleLanguageTechnologies2022","abstract":"As increasingly powerful natural language generation, representation, and understanding models are developed, made available and deployed across numerous downstream applications, many researchers and practitioners have warned about possible adverse impacts. Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Blodgett","given":"Su Lin"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Q.

  {"id":"bodWorldPatternsGlobal2022","abstract":"A comprehensive account of the methods of knowledge production throughout human history and across the globe.The idea that the world can be understood through patterns and the principles that govern them is one of the most important human insights—it may also be our greatest survival strategy. Our search for patterns and principles began 40,000 years ago, when striped patterns were engraved on mammoths' bones to keep track of the moon's phases. What routes did human knowledge take to grow from these humble beginnings through many detours and dead ends into modern understandings of nature and culture? In this work of unprecedented scope, Rens Bod removes the Western natural sciences from their often-central role to bring us the first global history of human knowledge. Having sketched the history of the humanities in his ground-breaking A New History of the Humanities, Bod now adopts a broader perspective, stepping beyond classical antiquity back to the Stone Age to answer the question: Where did our knowledge of the world today begin and how did it develop? Drawing on developments from all five continents of the inhabited world, World of Patterns offers startling connections. Focusing on a dozen fields—ranging from astronomy, philology, medicine, law, and mathematics to history, botany, and musicology—Bod examines to what degree their progressions can be considered interwoven and to what degree we can speak of global trends.In this pioneering work, Bod aims to fulfill what he sees as the historian's responsibility: to grant access to history's goldmine of ideas. Bod discusses how inoculation was invented in China rather than Europe; how many of the fundamental aspects of modern mathematics and astronomy were first discovered by the Indian Kerala school; and how the study of law provided fundamental models for astronomy and linguistics from Roman to Ottoman times. The book flies across continents and eras. The result is an enlightening symphony, a stirring chorus of human inquisitiveness extending through the ages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bod","given":"Rens"}],"citation-key":"bodWorldPatternsGlobal2022","event-place":"Baltimore","ISBN":"978-1-4214-4346-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","publisher-place":"Baltimore","source":"Project MUSE","title":"World of Patterns: A Global History of Knowledge","title-short":"World of Patterns","type":"book","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/oa_monograph/book/98273"},

To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Bommasani","given":"Rishi"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Drew A."},{"family":"Adeli","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Altman","given":"Russ"},{"family":"Arora","given":"Simran"},{"family":"Arx","given":"Sydney","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Bohg","given":"Jeannette"},{"family":"Bosselut","given":"Antoine"},{"family":"Brunskill","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Brynjolfsson","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Buch","given":"Shyamal"},{"family":"Card","given":"Dallas"},{"family":"Castellon","given":"Rodrigo"},{"family":"Chatterji","given":"Niladri"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Creel","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Jared Quincy"},{"family":"Demszky","given":"Dora"},{"family":"Donahue","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Doumbouya","given":"Moussa"},{"family":"Durmus","given":"Esin"},{"family":"Ermon","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Etchemendy","given":"John"},{"family":"Ethayarajh","given":"Kawin"},{"family":"Fei-Fei","given":"Li"},{"family":"Finn","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Gale","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Gillespie","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Goel","given":"Karan"},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Grossman","given":"Shelby"},{"family":"Guha","given":"Neel"},{"family":"Hashimoto","given":"Tatsunori"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"John"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Daniel E."},{"family":"Hong","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Icard","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Saahil"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Kalluri","given":"Pratyusha"},{"family":"Karamcheti","given":"Siddharth"},{"family":"Keeling","given":"Geoff"},{"family":"Khani","given":"Fereshte"},{"family":"Khattab","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Pang Wei"},{"family":"Krass","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Krishna","given":"Ranjay"},{"family":"Kuditipudi","given":"Rohith"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ananya"},{"family":"Ladhak","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Mina"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Leskovec","given":"Jure"},{"family":"Levent","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiang Lisa"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuechen"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Tengyu"},{"family":"Malik","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Manning","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Mirchandani","given":"Suvir"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Munyikwa","given":"Zanele"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Suraj"},{"family":"Narayan","given":"Avanika"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Deepak"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Allen"},{"family":"Niebles","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Nilforoshan","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Nyarko","given":"Julian"},{"family":"Ogut","given":"Giray"},{"family":"Orr","given":"Laurel"},{"family":"Papadimitriou","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Park","given":"Joon Sung"},{"family":"Piech","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Portelance","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Potts","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Raghunathan","given":"Aditi"},{"family":"Reich","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Hongyu"},{"family":"Rong","given":"Frieda"},{"family":"Roohani","given":"Yusuf"},{"family":"Ruiz","given":"Camilo"},{"family":"Ryan","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Ré","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Sadigh","given":"Dorsa"},{"family":"Sagawa","given":"Shiori"},{"family":"Santhanam","given":"Keshav"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Krishnan"},{"family":"Tamkin","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Taori","given":"Rohan"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Armin W."},{"family":"Tramèr","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Rose E."},{"family":"Wang","given":"William"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Bohan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jiajun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuhuai"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Sang Michael"},{"family":"Yasunaga","given":"Michihiro"},{"family":"You","given":"Jiaxuan"},{"family":"Zaharia","given":"Matei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xikun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuhui"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Percy"}],"citation-key":"bommasaniOpportunitiesRisksFoundation2022a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2108.07258","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258"},

  {"id":"boschYouAreNot2022","abstract":"Leading technologists, historians, and journalists reveal the stories behind the computer coding that touches all aspects of life—for better or worse Few of us give much thought to computer code or how it comes to be. The very word “code” makes it sound immutable or even inevitable. “You Are Not Expected to Understand This” demonstrates that, far from being preordained, computer code is the result of very human decisions, ones we all live with when we use social media, take photos, drive our cars, and engage in a host of other activities. Everything from law enforcement to space exploration relies on code written by people who, at the time, made choices and assumptions that would have long-lasting, profound implications for society. Torie Bosch brings together many of today’s leading technology experts to provide new perspectives on the codes that shape our lives. Contributors discuss a host of topics, such as how university databases were programmed long ago to accept only two genders, what the person who programmed the very first pop-up ad was thinking at the time, the first computer worm, the Bitcoin white paper, and perhaps the most famous seven words in Unix history: “You are not expected to understand this.” This compelling book tells the human stories behind programming, enabling those of us who don’t think much about code to recognize its importance, and those who work with it every day to better understand the long-term effects of the decisions they make.

  {"id":"bourtouleMachineUnlearning2019","abstract":"Once users have shared their data online, it is generally difficult for them to revoke access and ask for the data to be deleted. Machine learning (ML) exacerbates this problem because any model trained with said data may have memorized it, putting users at risk of a successful privacy attack exposing their information. Yet, having models unlearn is notoriously difficult. We introduce SISA training, a framework that expedites the unlearning process by strategically limiting the influence of a data point in the training procedure. While our framework is applicable to any learning algorithm, it is designed to achieve the largest improvements for stateful algorithms like stochastic gradient descent for deep neural networks. SISA training reduces the computational overhead associated with unlearning, even in the worst-case setting where unlearning requests are made uniformly across the training set. In some cases, the service provider may have a prior on the distribution of unlearning requests that will be issued by users. We may take this prior into account to partition and order data accordingly, and further decrease overhead from unlearning. Our evaluation spans several datasets from different domains, with corresponding motivations for unlearning. Under no distributional assumptions, for simple learning tasks, we observe that SISA training improves time to unlearn points from the Purchase dataset by 4.63x, and 2.45x for the SVHN dataset, over retraining from scratch. SISA training also provides a speed-up of 1.36x in retraining for complex learning tasks such as ImageNet classification; aided by transfer learning, this results in a small degradation in accuracy. Our work contributes to practical data governance in machine unlearning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bourtoule","given":"Lucas"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Choquette-Choo","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Jia","given":"Hengrui"},{"family":"Travers","given":"Adelin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Baiwu"},{"family":"Lie","given":"David"},{"family":"Papernot","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"bourtouleMachineUnlearning2019","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,9]]},"language":"en","title":"Machine Unlearning","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03817v3"},

Our focus is #HimToo, a short-lived Twitter-backlash to #MeToo concentrated around the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation. We explore how #HimToo flourished and floundered across two key periods: the first related to the broadcast confirmation hearings; the second a backlash triggered by a Kavanaugh-supporting mom. With a dataset of over 277,000 Tweets, we argue that the first period shows an actor-centric conservative engagement which is dominated by female commentators, but displays a male orientation. The second period presents both a serious and satirical response to the first. Whilst there is a significant reorientation of both activity and actors in this second period, we identify persistent gendered and generational patterns which warrant a more cautious response from feminist critics. We thus connect our analysis to debates about social media connectedness, gendered patterns of social media ab/use, and the role of social media in a highly polarised political climate in the USA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyle","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Rathnayake","given":"Chamil"}],"citation-key":"boyleHimTooNetworkingMisogyny2019","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2019.1661868","ISSN":"1468-0777","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,5]]},"page":"1-19","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"#HimToo and the networking of misogyny in the age of #MeToo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2019.1661868","volume":"0"},
  {"id":"braidottiPosthuman2013","abstract":"The Posthuman offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman. Digital 'second life', genetically modified food, advanced prosthetics, robotics and reproductive technologies are familiar facets of our globally linked and technologically mediated societies. This has blurred the traditional distinction between the human and its others, exposing the non-naturalistic structure of the human. The Posthuman starts by exploring the extent to which a post-humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject. Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral self-mastery, Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities. Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post-anthropocentric thought, which encompass not only other species, but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole. Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives, they result in hybridization, erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species, seeds, plants, animals and bacteria. These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism, but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future? The Posthuman concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities. Braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neo-humanism that emerge from the spectrum of post-colonial and race studies, as well as gender analysis and environmentalism. The challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building, while pursuing sustainability and empowerment","author":[{"family":"Braidotti","given":"Rosi"}],"call-number":"BD450 .B6425 2013","citation-key":"braidottiPosthuman2013","event-place":"Cambridge, UK ; Malden, MA, USA","ISBN":"978-0-7456-4157-7 978-0-7456-4158-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn842921459","number-of-pages":"229","publisher":"Polity Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK ; Malden, MA, USA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The posthuman","type":"book"},

With practical examples enriched by history and theory, these tips will empower you to break free from the consumerist trappings of our world. Anarchism is not just for white men, but for everyone. In reading this book, you can detach from patriarchal masculinity, norms of family, gender, sexuality, racialisation, individual responsibility and the destruction of our planet, and replace them with ideas of sustainable living, with ties of mutual aid, and the horizon of collective liberation.\"--","author":[{"family":"Branson","given":"Scott"}],"call-number":"HX833 .B736 2022","citation-key":"bransonPracticalAnarchismGuide2022","event-place":"London ; Las Vegas, NV","ISBN":"978-0-7453-4492-8 978-0-7453-4493-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"note":"OCLC: on1304816739","number-of-pages":"172","publisher":"Pluto Press","publisher-place":"London ; Las Vegas, NV","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Practical anarchism: a guide for daily life","title-short":"Practical anarchism","type":"book"},

  {"id":"braybrookeInterviewGrowingInterdisciplinary2023","abstract":"Interview between Sarah Allen of Mozilla and myself in the Collaborative Incubator Toolkit (2023). \n\n\"Curated and produced by the Beyond the Now collective (in the context of Re-framing Migrants in the European Media), the Collaborative Incubator Toolkit is the result of a long-form conversation in which journalists, digital activists and socially-engaged artists draw on their own experiences of migration and forced displacement to inform their criticisms of the way migration is represented by legacy media.\n\nThe Collaborative Incubator brings together practitioners and actors, many of whom have lived experiences of migration or are diversely shaped by inter-generational histories of displacement. The goal of the project has been to set up a transdisciplinary dialogue, with the potential to shed light on the ethical, aesthetic and practical questions raised by the dominant representations of migration. It explores how perspectives and practices might be shared in pursuit of new kinds of collaborative storytelling.\n\nHowever, not all the contributors included in this toolkit focus solely on migration. We were also interested to learn from the investigative method and the skills associated with sustained inquiry and reportage as away to expand the potential for socially engaged storytelling. To this end, the collaborative incubators documented here comprised provocations, discussions and workshops, opening a space for collective listening and mutual exchange, with the aim of identifying areas of commonality, together with constructive differences between the practice of artists and journalists.\nThe first two incubators took place online in November and December 2022; the third over three days at WolfKino in Berlin, January 2023.\"","author":[{"family":"Braybrooke","given":"Kit Kat"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"braybrookeInterviewGrowingInterdisciplinary2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,1]]},"page":"74-82","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Interview: Growing an interdisciplinary virtual community and its 'third spaces'","title-short":"Interview","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"bridgesDigitalFailureUnbecoming2021","abstract":"This paper explores the political potential of digital failure as a refusal to work in service of today’s dataveillance society. Moving beyond criticisms of flawed digital systems, this paper traces the moments of digital failure that seek to break, rather than fix, existing systems. Instead, digital failure is characterized by pesky data that sneaks through the cracks of digital capitalism and dissipates into the unproductive; it supports run-away data prone to misidentifications by digital marketers, coders, and content moderators; and it celebrates data predisposed to “back-talk” with playful irreverence toward those that seek to bring order through normative categorization and moderation. I call these data entropic, fugitive, and queer and explore their mischievous practices through three case studies: the unaccountable data in identity resolution, public shaming of the ImageNet training data, and reading practices of sex worker and influencer, @Charlieshe. Together these case studies articulate the political potential of digital failure as a process of unbecoming the good data subject by pushing past the margins of legibility, knowability, and thinkability, to reveal what is made illegible, unknowable, and unthinkable to data’s seeing eye. As predictive analytics, automated decision-systems, and artificial intelligence take on increasingly central roles in public governance, digital failure reveals how data itself is a flawed concept prone to political abuse and social engineering to protect the interests of the powerful, while keeping those marginalized over-surveilled and underrepresented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bridges","given":"Lauren E"}],"citation-key":"bridgesDigitalFailureUnbecoming2021","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951720977882","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2053951720977882","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Digital failure: Unbecoming the “good” data subject through entropic, fugitive, and queer data","title-short":"Digital failure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951720977882","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"brionesrojasDiscloseTellData2021","abstract":"Data visualization for alternative narratives is a powerful adversarial tool that seeks to inquire about the existing conditions of conflicts. Nowadays, data visualization is widely used in activist communication to offer data-driven counternarratives to those with dominant power. However, a study of 64 cases shows that most visualizations are far from following the open-source ethos that data activism advocates. If visualizations for alternative narratives do not open up their processes and communicate how the meaning of data is shaped and translated visually, they risk turning into black-box devices that crystallize biased representations of conflict rather than investigating them. This paper presents a data design framework for visualizations used in alternative narratives. It is presented as a methodological tool that encourages actionable data practices that promote a more critical and reflective data culture. The framework is structured in two ways of approaching the process of working with data: from the parts of the process and from the process as a whole. The first approach presents four lenses intended to materialize aspects of the process of working with and making sense of data: Open/close, Composition, Zoom, and Sanitization. The second approach proposes a self-hacking operation of disclosing the production process of the visualizations. This paper argues that visualizations for alternative narratives ought to be open artifacts that promote the democratization of re-interpretation and critical data by disclosing the design decisions that were made on the dataset, as well as its visual, and interactive representation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Briones Rojas","given":"María de los Ángeles"}],"citation-key":"brionesrojasDiscloseTellData2021","container-title":"Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)","container-title-short":"Comput Supported Coop Work","DOI":"10.1007/s10606-021-09416-1","ISSN":"1573-7551","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"785-809","source":"Springer Link","title":"Disclose to Tell: a Data Design Framework for Alternative Narratives","title-short":"Disclose to Tell","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10606-021-09416-1","volume":"30"},

Recent years have seen both an explosion in AI systems and a corresponding rise in important critical analyses of these technologies. Central to these analyses has been feminist scholarship, which calls upon the AI sector to be accountable for designing and deploying AI in ways that further, rather than undermine, the pursuit of social justice. Feminist AI showcases the vital contributions of feminist scholarship to thinking about AI, data, and intelligent machines as well as laying the groundwork for future feminist scholarship on AI. It brings together scholars from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, from computer science, software engineering, and medical sciences to political theory, anthropology, and literature. It provides an entry point for scholars of AI, science and technology into the diversity of feminist approaches to AI, and creates a rich dialogue between scholars and practitioners of AI to examine the powerful congruences and generative tensions between different feminist approaches to new and emerging technologies\"--","citation-key":"browneFeministAICritical2023","editor":[{"family":"Browne","given":"J."},{"family":"Cave","given":"S."},{"family":"Drage","given":"E."},{"family":"McInerney","given":"K."}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-288989-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Feminist AI: critical perspectives on algorithms, data, and intelligent machines","title-short":"Feminist AI","type":"book"},

  {"id":"brownLanguageModelsAre2020","abstract":"Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Tom B."},{"family":"Mann","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Ryder","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Subbiah","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Jared"},{"family":"Dhariwal","given":"Prafulla"},{"family":"Neelakantan","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Shyam","given":"Pranav"},{"family":"Sastry","given":"Girish"},{"family":"Askell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sandhini"},{"family":"Herbert-Voss","given":"Ariel"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Henighan","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Child","given":"Rewon"},{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Clemens"},{"family":"Hesse","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Sigler","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Litwin","given":"Mateusz"},{"family":"Gray","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Chess","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Berner","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"McCandlish","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Radford","given":"Alec"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Amodei","given":"Dario"}],"citation-key":"brownLanguageModelsAre2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2005.14165","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165"},

They have survived and some would argue flourished in an environment of participatory social media and declining print circulation. Zine-making is a contradictory, lo-fi, do-it-yourself media-making practice, rich in parallel research traditions and historical engagements across many vocal creative and social communities. This study investigated the constructs that influenced the decision to choose to make zines in the digital age. Drawing on thirty-four semi-structured email interviews, conducted between 2011 and 2015, the study interrogated and defined the motivations of individuals to participate in zine-making. Using a constructivist grounded theory inquiry, a theoretical model was developed from the responses that located the activities undertaken to make a zine within a four-stage model of zine-making participation processes. The study argued that these stages were not enacted sequentially or discretely, but coalesced into liminal spaces that shaped the aspirational and attitudinal aesthetics of zines. It is within these liminal spaces that zine-makers defined and shared their own understanding of what they were choosing to participate in. Zine-makers, by constructing and sharing meaning and their identity through zine-making, became part of a bounded but fragile communitas of makers and readers, where small sub-spaces intersect to form semi-private spaces defined by an almost infinite combination of geographical locations, socio-cultural influences, digital technology and social media practices, interests, types of making, attitudes and beliefs, lived experiences and audiences. Finally, the study locates the impacts, influences and transformative effects of digital technology and social media practices on the decision to make zines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bryant","given":"Peter James"}],"citation-key":"bryantChoosingZinesDefining2017","genre":"Thesis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en_AU","license":"The author owns the copyright in this thesis including all reproduction and reuse rights for the work.

  {"id":"bryantOntoCartographyOntologyMachines2014","abstract":"Onto-Cartography gives an unapologetic defense of naturalism and materialism, transforming these familiar positions and showing how culture itself is formed by nature. Bryant endorses a pan-ecological theory of being, arguing that societies are ecosystems that can only be understood by considering nonhuman material agencies such as rivers and mountain ranges alongside signifying agencies such as discourses, narratives, and ideologies. In this way, Bryant lays the foundations for a new machine-oriented ontology.This theoretically omnivorous work draws on disciplines as diverse as deconstruction, psychoanalysis, Marxism, media studies, object-oriented ontology, the new materialist feminisms, actor-network theory, biology, and sociology. Through its fresh attention to nonhumans and material being, it also provides a framework for integrating the most valuable findings of critical theory and social constructivism.","author":[{"family":"Bryant","given":"Levi R."}],"citation-key":"bryantOntoCartographyOntologyMachines2014","edition":"1 edition","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-0-7486-7997-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,30]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"256","publisher":"Edinburgh University Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"Amazon","title":"Onto-Cartography: An Ontology of Machines and Media","title-short":"Onto-Cartography","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bubeck","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Chandrasekaran","given":"Varun"},{"family":"Eldan","given":"Ronen"},{"family":"Gehrke","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Horvitz","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Kamar","given":"Ece"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yin Tat"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanzhi"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Nori","given":"Harsha"},{"family":"Palangi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Marco Tulio"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"bubeckSparksArtificialGeneral2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.12712","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.12712","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4","title-short":"Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712"},
  {"id":"bucherAlgorithmicImaginaryExploring2017","abstract":"This article reflects the kinds of situations and spaces where people and algorithms meet. In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their often hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people's use of these platforms, if at all? To help answer these questions, this article examines people's personal stories about the Facebook algorithm through tweets and interviews with 25 ordinary users. To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article develops the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. It is argued that the algorithmic imaginary – ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be and how they function – is not just productive of different moods and sensations but plays a generative role in moulding the Facebook algorithm itself. Examining how algorithms make people feel, then, seems crucial if we want to understand their social power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bucher","given":"Taina"}],"citation-key":"bucherAlgorithmicImaginaryExploring2017","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154086","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,2]]},"page":"30-44","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The algorithmic imaginary: exploring the ordinary affects of Facebook algorithms","title-short":"The algorithmic imaginary","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2016.1154086","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"bucherIfThenAlgorithmic2018","abstract":"'If...Then' provides an account of power and politics in the algorithmic media landscape that pays attention to the multiple realities of algorithms, and how these relate and coexist.   The argument is made that algorithms do not merely have power and politics; they help to produce certain forms of acting and knowing in the world. In processing, classifying, sorting, and ranking data, algorithms are political in that they help to make the world appear in certain ways rather than others. Analyzing Facebook’s news feed, social media user’s everyday encounters with algorithmic systems, and the discourses and work practices of news professionals, the book makes a case for going beyond the narrow, technical definition of algorithms as step-by-step procedures for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. Drawing on a process-relational theoretical framework and empirical data from field observations and fifty-five interviews, the author demonstrates how algorithms exist in multiple ways beyond code. The analysis is concerned with the world-making capacities of algorithms, questioning how algorithmic systems shape encounters and orientations of different kinds, and how these systems are endowed with diffused personhood and relational agency. IF … THEN argues that algorithmic power and politics is neither about algorithms determining how the social world is fabricated nor about what algorithms do per se. Rather it is about how and when different aspects of algorithms and the algorithmic become available to specific actors, under what circumstance, and who or what gets to be part of how algorithms are defined.--publisher.","author":[{"family":"Bucher","given":"Taina"}],"citation-key":"bucherIfThenAlgorithmic2018","collection-title":"Oxford studies in digital politics","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-19-049304-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"If...then: algorithmic power and politics","title-short":"If...then","type":"book"},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6% for IJB-A and 86.2% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Buolamwini","given":"Joy"},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"}],"citation-key":"buolamwiniGenderShadesIntersectional2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the 1st Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency","event-title":"Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency","ISSN":"2640-3498","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,21]]},"language":"en","page":"77-91","publisher":"PMLR","source":"proceedings.mlr.press","title":"Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification","title-short":"Gender Shades","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html"},

We present an argument that ASMR and frisson are interrelated in that they appear to arise through similar physiological mechanisms, and both may be induced or enhanced through the practice of mindfulness.","author":[{"family":"Campo","given":"Marisa A.","dropping-particle":"del"},{"family":"Kehle","given":"Thomas J."}],"citation-key":"campoAutonomousSensoryMeridian2016","container-title":"International Journal of School & Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1080/21683603.2016.1130582","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,2]]},"page":"99-105","title":"Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and frisson: Mindfully induced sensory phenomena that promote happiness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy2.usc.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21683603.2016.1130582","volume":"4"},

At times, they subvert them. In science, servant-beings are frequently described as demons and angels. Who are these effective agents? This essay traces parts of the large historical network of persons and places in which ‘little helpers’ service their master’s will. It looks at instances where masters try to exorcise the servant-demons who instead of helping them, disturb their plans. By uncovering fragments of this often hidden network, we explore the strange relationship between masters and servants, and the role of earthly and heavenly agents in science.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Canales","given":"Jimena"},{"family":"Krajewski","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"canalesLittleHelpersDemons2012","container-title":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","container-title-short":"Interdisciplinary Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1179/0308018812Z.00000000025","ISSN":"0308-0188, 1743-2790","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"language":"en","page":"314-331","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Little Helpers.

However, despite the growing number of publications and implementations, there is still a critical lack of literature that explains the interplay of fair machine learning with the social sciences of philosophy, sociology, and law. We hope to remedy this issue by accumulating and expounding upon the thoughts and discussions of fair machine learning produced by both social and formal (i.e., machine learning and statistics) sciences in this field guide. Specifically, in addition to giving the mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds of several popular statistics-based fair machine learning metrics used in fair machine learning, we explain the underlying philosophical and legal thoughts that support them. Furthermore, we explore several criticisms of the current approaches to fair machine learning from sociological, philosophical, and legal viewpoints.

In this paper, we introduce two new dataset poisoning attacks that intentionally introduce malicious examples to a model's performance. Our attacks are immediately practical and could, today, poison 10 popular datasets. Our first attack, split-view poisoning, exploits the mutable nature of internet content to ensure a dataset annotator's initial view of the dataset differs from the view downloaded by subsequent clients. By exploiting specific invalid trust assumptions, we show how we could have poisoned 0.01% of the LAION-400M or COYO-700M datasets for just $60 USD. Our second attack, frontrunning poisoning, targets web-scale datasets that periodically snapshot crowd-sourced content -- such as Wikipedia -- where an attacker only needs a time-limited window to inject malicious examples. In light of both attacks, we notify the maintainers of each affected dataset and recommended several low-overhead defenses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Carlini","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Jagielski","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Choquette-Choo","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Paleka","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Pearce","given":"Will"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Hyrum"},{"family":"Terzis","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Kurt"},{"family":"Tramèr","given":"Florian"}],"citation-key":"carliniPoisoningWebScaleTraining2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2302.10149","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,20]]},"number":"arXiv:2302.10149","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Poisoning Web-Scale Training Datasets is Practical","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149"},

  {"id":"centralsaintmartinsHybridFuturesDiagrams2020","abstract":"In the current regime of algorithmic prediction, the future is being computed in real-time. This process is of a spatial nature: past data are vectorised into mathematical spaces where predictions are produced through geometric operations. The results are folded back onto the present, reshaping it as a distorted image of the past optimised for certain variables (profit, attention capture, engagement, etc). The negative effects of these prescriptive mechanisms are well documented and continue to unfold.\n\nDesign is involved with them in various capacities, from the implementation of interfaces to the aestheticisation of an imaginary \"artificial intelligence\".\n\nIn this talk, David Benqué argues that design can engage critically with algorithmic prediction using diagrams as a language. Diagrams accurately describe the inner workings of algorithmic processes while also surfacing broader social and political ramifications, all while speaking to the spatial sensibilities/practices of design. This language can be mobilised to dig deep into the algorithmic systems and the rationalities that they support, making them available for excavation, examination, manipulation, and critique.\n\nDavid Benqué\n\nDavid Benqué is a designer and researcher from Paris France, living and working in London UK. He is a recent PhD graduate from the Royal College of Art. His thesis proposes diagrams as a language to critically investigate algorithmic prediction.

  {"id":"cerankowskiSutureTraumaTrans2021","abstract":"\"The landscape of trauma is scattered with ghosts. Wolves hunkering in the shadows. Memory's spectral persistence and evasion. Leaky bodies and selves gathered up in the storm of pain. Genders imposed and genders made. History's cruel excisions, scars, the spillage of wounds. A landscape in which we are nevertheless called to build home. Here, \"storytelling is a kind of suturing.\" Combining memoir, lyrical essay, and cultural criticism, KJ Cerankowski's Suture: Trauma and Trans Becoming stitches together an embodied history of trauma and its ongoing impacts on the lived realities of trans, queer, and other marginalized subjects. Suture is a conjuration, a patchwork knitting of ghost stories attending to the wound as its own archive. It is a journey through many \"transitions\": of gender; through illness and chronic pain; from childhood to adulthood and back again; of psyche and form in the wake of abuse and through the work of healing; and of the self, becoming in and through the ongoingness of settler colonial violence and its attendant subjugations of diverse forms of life. Refusing a traditional binary-based gender transition narrative, as well as dominant psychoanalytic narratives of trauma that center an individual process of symptom, diagnosis, and cure, Suture explores the refractive nature of trauma's dispersed roots and lingering effects. If the wounds of trauma are disquiet apparitions-repetitions within the cut-these stories tend the seams through which the simultaneous loneliness of mourning and togetherness of queer intersubjective relations converge. Across these essays, healing, and indeed living, is a state of perpetual becoming, surviving, and loving, in the nonlinearities of trauma time, body-time, and queer time\"--","author":[{"family":"Cerankowski","given":"K.

Through interviews, observations, and a user survey, we present a sampling of the artistic styles and describe the developed community of practice around generative AI. We find that: 1) the text prompt and the resulting image can be considered collectively as an art piece prompts as art and 2) prompt templates (prompts with ``slots'' for others to fill in with their own words) are developed to create generative art styles. We discover that the value placed by this community on unique outputs leads to artists seeking specialized vocabulary to produce distinctive art pieces (e.g., by reading architectural blogs to find phrases to describe images). We also find that some artists use \"glitches\" in the model that can be turned into artistic styles of their own right. From these findings, we outline specific implications for design regarding future prompting and image editing options.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Minsuk"},{"family":"Druga","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Fiannaca","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Vergani","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Chinmay"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Carrie"},{"family":"Terry","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"changPromptArtists2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.12253","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.12253","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Prompt Artists","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12253"},

The ability of these models to memorize an unknown set of books complicates assessments of measurement validity for cultural analytics by contaminating test data; we show that models perform much better on memorized books than on nonmemorized books for downstream tasks.

Derived from our every search, like, click, and purchase, algorithms determine the news we get, the ads we see, the information accessible to us and even who our friends are. These complex configurations not only form knowledge and social relationships in the digital and physical world, but also determine who we are and who we can be, both on and offline.&nbsp; &nbsp; Algorithms create and recreate us, using our data to assign and reassign our gender, race, sexuality, and citizenship status. They can recognize us as celebrities or mark us as terrorists. In this era of ubiquitous surveillance, contemporary data collection entails more than gathering information about us.

This poses a challenge: are cybersecurity experts thus justified to attack malicious AI algorithms, methods and systems as well, to stop them? Would that be fair and ethical? Furthermore, AI and machine learning algorithms are prone to be fooled or misled by the so-called adversarial attacks. However, adversarial attacks could be used by cybersecurity experts to stop the criminals using AI, and tamper with their systems. The paper argues that this kind of attacks could be named Ethical Adversarial Attacks (EAA), and if used fairly, within the regulations and legal frameworks, they would prove to be a valuable aid in the fight against cybercrime.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Choraś","given":"Michał"},{"family":"Woźniak","given":"Michał"}],"citation-key":"chorasDoubleedgedSwordAI2022","container-title":"AI and Ethics","container-title-short":"AI Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s43681-021-00113-9","ISSN":"2730-5961","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"631-634","source":"Springer Link","title":"The double-edged sword of AI: Ethical Adversarial Attacks to counter artificial intelligence for crime","title-short":"The double-edged sword of AI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-021-00113-9","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"chunHabitsLeakingSluts2015","abstract":"This essay attempts to disable the \"ruinous\" logic that has fueled recent slut-shaming on Web 2.0 by making visible the ways in which our machines are promiscuous-routinely \"leaking.\" The authors present the leak as a habit so as to disrupt the illusion of privacy and sealed subjectivity that enables the possibility of being a \"victim\" of slut-shaming, revenge porn, and similar dangers of Web 2.0. They argue that blaming the user for leaks only detracts from the systematic vulnerabilities of Web 2.0. The essay looks at the pernicious practice of \"ruining\" young, white, female subjects through the circulation of naked or sexual images of them. This habit not only exemplifies the linking of subjectivity, privacy, and whiteness but also the way in which the online subject is figured as open, vulnerable, and perhaps asking for it-that is, traditionally female. The essay argues that rather than call for bubbles of privacy that seal off online subjects, as if to prevent their leaking or sluttiness, the inherent promiscuity of new media must be embraced.","author":[{"family":"Chun","given":"Wendy Hui Kyong"},{"family":"Friedland","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"chunHabitsLeakingSluts2015","container-title":"differences","DOI":"10.1215/10407391-3145937","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",9]]},"language":"English","page":"1-28","title":"Habits of Leaking: Of Sluts and Network Cards","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/10407391-3145937","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"chunUpdatingRemainSame2016","abstract":"New media – we are told – exist at the bleeding edge of obsolescence. We thus forever try to catch up, updating to remain the same. Meanwhile, analytic, creative, and commercial efforts focus exclusively on the next big thing: figuring out what will spread and who will spread it the fastest. But what do we miss in this constant push to the future? In Updating to Remain the Same, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun suggests another approach, arguing that our media matter most when they seem not to matter at all – when they have moved from'new'to habitual. Smart phones, for example, no longer amaze, but they increasingly structure and monitor our lives. Through habits, Chun says, new media become embedded in our lives – indeed, we become our machines: we stream, update, capture, upload, link, save, trash, and troll.Chun links habits to the rise of networks as the defining concept of our era. Networks have been central to the emergence of neoliberalism, replacing'society'with groupings of individuals and connectable'YOUS.'(For isn't'new media'actually'NYOU media'?) Habit is central to the inversion of privacy and publicity that drives neoliberalism and networks. Why do we view our networked devices as'personal'when they are so chatty and promiscuous? What would happen, Chun asks, if, rather than pushing for privacy that is no privacy, we demanded public rights – the right to be exposed, to take risks and to be in public and not be attacked?","author":[{"family":"Chun","given":"Wendy Hui Kyong"}],"citation-key":"chunUpdatingRemainSame2016","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-03449-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","title":"Updating to Remain the Same : Habitual New Media","type":"book","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1244290&authtype=sso&custid=s8983984"},
  {"id":"churchStatisticalModelsNatural2022","abstract":"There is a considerable literature on applications of statistical methods in natural-language processing. This chapter focuses on two types of applications: (1) recognition/transduction applications based on Shannon’s Noisy Channel such as speech recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), spelling correction, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and machine translation (MT); and (2) discrimination/ranking applications such as sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spam email filtering, author identification, and word sense disambiguation (WSD). Shannon’s Noisy-Channel model is often used for the first type, and linear separators such as Naive Bayes and logistic regression are often used for the second type. These techniques have produced successful products that are being used by large numbers of people every day: web search, spelling correction, translation, etc. Despite successes such as these, it should be mentioned that all approximations have their limitations. At some point, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, the next generation may discover that the low-hanging fruit has been pretty well picked over, and it may be necessary to revisit some of these classic limitations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Church","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"churchStatisticalModelsNatural2022","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.54","editor":[{"family":"Mitkov","given":"Ruslan"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-957369-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"page":"0","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Silverchair","title":"Statistical Models for Natural Language Processing","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.54"},

  {"id":"cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is quietly shaping social structures and private lives. Although it promises parity and efficiency, its computational processes mirror biases of existing power even as often-proprietary data practices and cultural perceptions of computational magic obscure those influences. However, intersectionality—which foregrounds an analysis of institutional power and incorporates queer, feminist, and critical race theories—can help to rethink artificial intelligence. An intersectional framework can be used to analyze the biases and problems built into existing artificial intelligence, as well as to uncover alternative ethics from its counter-histories. This paper calls for the application of intersectional strategies to artificial intelligence at every level, from data to design to implementation, from technologist to user. Drawing on intersectional theories, the research argues these strategies are polyvocal, multimodal, and experimental—suggesting that community-focused and artistic practices can help imagine AI’s intersectional possibilities and help begin to address its biases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ciston","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019","container-title":"Journal of Science and Technology of the Arts","DOI":"10.7559/citarj.v11i2.665","ISSN":"2183-0088","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,29]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2019 Journal of Science and Technology of the Arts","page":"3-8","source":"artes.ucp.pt","title":"Intersectional AI Is Essential: Polyvocal, Multimodal, Experimental Methods to Save Artificial Intelligence","title-short":"Intersectional AI Is Essential","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://artes.ucp.pt/citarj/article/view/665","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"clark-parsonsSEEYOUBELIEVE2019","abstract":"Hashtag feminism, a form of activism that appropriates Twitter’s metadata tags for organizing posts to draw visibility to a cause, has become a central component of the feminist media repertoire. Much discourse about hashtag feminism revolves around whether or not Twitter is an effective tool for activism. This instrumentalist approach leaves activists’ strategies for juggling both the affordances and limitations of hashtag feminism under-theorized. Taking up a case study of the #MeToo movement, I consider practitioners’ perspectives on hashtag feminism and highlight the processes through which activists develop tactics while working within particular sociotechnical constraints. Through an analysis of a meta-tweets, or tweets about the campaign, I argue that hashtag feminism is a contentious performance in which activists make the personal political by making it visible, bridging the individual with the collective and illustrating the systemic nature of social injustice. As #MeToo demonstrates, however, making the personal visible on a globally networked stage opens activists up to a variety of risks. To address these limitations, #MeToo participants developed performance maintenance strategies, through which they evaluated the campaign’s shortcomings and advanced solutions. Their reflexivity points toward hashtag feminism as a complex recursive process aimed at achieving a transformative politics of visibility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Clark-Parsons","given":"Rosemary"}],"citation-key":"clark-parsonsSEEYOUBELIEVE2019","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2019.1628797","ISSN":"1468-0777","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,24]]},"page":"1-19","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"“I SEE YOU, I BELIEVE YOU, I STAND WITH YOU”: #MeToo and the performance of networked feminist visibility","title-short":"“I SEE YOU, I BELIEVE YOU, I STAND WITH YOU”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2019.1628797","volume":"0"},

It is hard to imagine a “different” Internet, but the character of the Internet as we experience it today is, in fact, contingent on key decisions made in the past by its designers, those who have invested in it, and those who have regulated it. With different choices, we might have a very different Internet today. This paper uses past choices made during the emergence of the early Internet as a lens to look toward its future, which is equally contingent on decisions being made today: by industry, by governments, by users, and by the research community.

The stimulating essays and experimental compositions in <i>The User Unconscious</i> delve into the ways digital media and computational technologies fundamentally affect our sense of self and the world we live in, from both human and other-than-human perspectives.  Critical theorist Patricia Ticineto Clough's provocative essays center around the motif of the \"user unconscious\" to advance the challenging thesis that that we are both human and other-than-human: we now live, think, and dream within multiple layers of computational networks that are constantly present, radically transforming subjectivity, sociality, and unconscious processes.  Drawing together rising strains of philosophy, critical theory, and media studies, as well as the political, social, and economic transformations that are shaping the twenty-first-century world, <i>The User Unconscious</i> points toward emergent crises and potentialities in both human subjectivity and sociality.

  {"id":"cockayneQueeringCodeSpace2017","abstract":"The mutual production of space by sexuality and technology has been differently addressed in the often-disparate disciplinary pursuits of queer geographies and critical studies of technology in geography. Building on Dodge and Kitchin’s ‘code/space,’ we highlight how studies of technology in geography are already concerned with questions of sexuality through the examination of biopolitics and the regulation of bodies, together with the (re-)establishment of new and old lines between the public and the private. The immanence of sexuality in code/space foregrounds the importance of spatial processes characterised by their difference and normativity in the geographies of technology. Queer geographies critically examine such different experiences and processes of differentiation through space in their nuanced conceptualisations of spatial regulation and transgression. We illustrate how these two bodies of geographical scholarship might be synthesised by outlining three approaches for studies of ‘queer code/space.’ To show how there are a variety of relationships between sexuality, code, and space, we play on the double entendre of ‘code’ as a set of social rules and norms, and ‘code’ as the set of algorithmic instructions underlying software systems. In both senses, codes constrain forms of intimate life, but can also transgress, disrupt, and distribute the norm. To queer code/space is to emphasise the complexities of difference and normativity in living with technologies, where technologies might both proliferate and regulate socio-spatial experience.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Cockayne","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Lizzie"}],"citation-key":"cockayneQueeringCodeSpace2017","container-title":"Gender, Place & Culture","DOI":"10.1080/0966369X.2017.1339672","ISSN":"0966-369X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,2]]},"page":"1642-1658","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Queering code/space: the co-production of socio-sexual codes and digital technologies","title-short":"Queering code/space","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0966369X.2017.1339672","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"cornellMassEffectArt2015","abstract":"Essays, discussions, and image portfolios map the evolution of art forms engaged with the Internet. Since the turn of the millennium, the Internet has evolved from what was merely a new medium to a true mass medium--with a deeper and wider cultural reach, greater opportunities for distribution and collaboration, and more complex corporate and political realities. Mapping a loosely chronological series of formative arguments, developments, and happenings, Mass Effect provides an essential guide to understanding the dynamic and ongoing relationship between art and new technologies. Mass Effect brings together nearly forty contributions, including newly commissioned essays and reprints, image portfolios, and transcribed discussion panels and lectures that offer insights and reflections from a wide range of artists, curators, art historians, and bloggers. Among the topics examined are the use of commercial platforms for art practice, what art means in an age of increasing surveillance, and questions surrounding such recent concepts as \"postinternet.\" Other contributions analyze and document particular works by the artists of And/Or Gallery, Cory Arcangel, DIS, Cao Fei, the Radical Software Group, and others. Mass Effect relaunches a publication series initiated by the MIT Press and the New Museum in 1984, which produced six defining volumes for the field of contemporary art. These new volumes will build on this historic partnership and reinvigorate the conversation around contemporary culture once again.

  {"id":"corryProblemZombieDatasets2021","abstract":"What happens when a machine learning dataset is deprecated for legal, ethical, or technical reasons, but continues to be widely used? In this paper, we examine the public afterlives of several prominent deprecated or redacted datasets, including ImageNet, 80 Million Tiny Images, MS-Celeb-1M, Duke MTMC, Brainwash, and HRT Transgender, in order to inform a framework for more consistent, ethical, and accountable dataset deprecation. Building on prior research, we find that there is a lack of consistency, transparency, and centralized sourcing of information on the deprecation of datasets, and as such, these datasets and their derivatives continue to be cited in papers and circulate online. These datasets that never die -- which we term \"zombie datasets\" -- continue to inform the design of production-level systems, causing technical, legal, and ethical challenges; in so doing, they risk perpetuating the harms that prompted their supposed withdrawal, including concerns around bias, discrimination, and privacy. Based on this analysis, we propose a Dataset Deprecation Framework that includes considerations of risk, mitigation of impact, appeal mechanisms, timeline, post-deprecation protocol, and publication checks that can be adapted and implemented by the machine learning community. Drawing on work on datasheets and checklists, we further offer two sample dataset deprecation sheets and propose a centralized repository that tracks which datasets have been deprecated and could be incorporated into the publication protocols of venues like NeurIPS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Corry","given":"Frances"},{"family":"Sridharan","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Luccioni","given":"Alexandra Sasha"},{"family":"Ananny","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"corryProblemZombieDatasets2021","container-title":"arXiv:2111.04424 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Problem of Zombie Datasets:A Framework For Deprecating Datasets","title-short":"The Problem of Zombie Datasets","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04424"},

  {"id":"CripAuthorshipDisability2023","abstract":"An expansive volume presenting crip approaches to writing, research, and publishing Crip Authorship: Disability as Method is a comprehensive volume presenting the multidisciplinary methods brought into being by disability studies and activism. Mara Mills and Rebecca Sanchez have convened leading scholars, artists, and activists to explore how disability shapes authorship, transforming cultural production, aesthetics, and media. Starting from the premise that disability is plural and authorship is an ongoing project, this collection of thirty-five compact essays asks how knowledge about disability is produced and shared in disability studies. Crip authorship takes place within and beyond the commodity version of authorship, in books, on social media, and in creative works that will never be published. Crip authorship celebrates people, experiences, and methods that have been obscured; it also involves protest and dismantling. It can mean innovating around accessibility or attending to the false starts, dead ends, and failures resulting from mis-fit and oppression. The chapters draw on the expertise of international researchers and activists in the humanities, social sciences, education, arts, and design. Across five sections—Writing, Research, Genre/Form, Publishing, Media—contributors consider disability as method for creative work: practices of writing and other forms of composition; research methods and collaboration; crip aesthetics; media formats and hacks; and the capital, access, legal standing, and care networks required to publish. Designed to be accessible and engaging for students, Crip Authorship also provides theoretically sophisticated arguments in a condensed form that will make the text a key resource for disability studies scholars. Essays include Mel Y Chen on the temporality of writing with chronic illness; Remi Yergeau on perseveration; La Marr Jurelle Bruce on the wisdom in mad Black rants; Alison Kafer on the reliance of the manifesto genre on conceptualizations of disability; Jaipreet Virdi on public scholarship for disability justice; Ellen Samuels on the importance of disability and illness to autotheory; Xuan Thuy Nguyen on decolonial research methods for disability studies; Emily Lim Rogers on virtual ethnography; Cameron Awkward-Rich on depression and trans reading methods; Robert McRuer on crip theory in translation; Kelsie Acton on plain language writing; and Georgina Kleege on description as an access technique.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"citation-key":"CripAuthorshipDisability2023","container-title":"Crip Authorship","DOI":"10.18574/nyu/9781479819386.001.0001","ISBN":"978-1-4798-1938-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"New York University Press","source":"www-degruyter-com.libproxy1.usc.edu","title":"Crip Authorship: Disability as Method","title-short":"Crip Authorship","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.18574/nyu/9781479819386.001.0001/html"},

  {"id":"croneFlickerTimeFabulation2017","abstract":"This essay explores the flicker or flicker-image as a flash of light that has the potential to disrupt the mechanics of vision. The most elemental of images, the flicker is at the very basis of both vision and mechanical image production; it is the flash of light that makes an image possible, and it is the continuous flickering of light across the eye (or lens) that connects visual perception with time perception through the operation of critical flicker frequency: the speed at which the brain joins those flashes of light together and thus perceives the movement of time. Yet when isolated or disaggregated from continuous movement, the flicker-image disrupts the smooth space of both image production and time perception. The flicker-image therefore refers to a correlation between analogue cinema practice in which a frame of film runs flickering through the projector and the physiological mechanics of image production in which flickering light is perceived by the brain. To think of images in this way is to understand images as single elements, as flashes of light, frames of film, individual pixels – individual units that are joined together. Image. Followed by image. Followed by image. Yet to insist on the flicker-image as a single flash of light – a “cut” or “point cut” as Gilles Deleuze does in his few pages of writing on experimental artists’ film – is to isolate an image from the constant movement of images, and, in doing so, to break into the flow of time: interrupting, disrupting or re-routing time’s movement (Deleuze 2005: 207).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Crone","given":"Bridget"}],"citation-key":"croneFlickerTimeFabulation2017","container-title":"Futures and Fictions","editor":[{"family":"Gunkel","given":"G."},{"family":"Hameed","given":"A."},{"family":"O'Sullivan","given":"S."}],"event-place":"London, UK","ISBN":"978-1-910924-63-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"268-294","publisher":"Repeater Books","publisher-place":"London, UK","source":"research.gold.ac.uk","title":"Flicker Time and Fabulation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://repeaterbooks.com/product/futures-and-fictions/"},

While many in HCI and design have examined the impulse to solve problems—the solutionist or techno-solutionist mindset—we examine the logic that binds the solution and the problem together as a pair. Focusing on the timely and consequential problem of systemic racial injustice, we think through the paradoxical possibility that the pairing of the problem and solution (so often treated as the default in design and HCI) perpetuates the very conditions we seek to improve. With Calvin Warren’s profound Afro-pessimism, we recognize how the tools used to solve structural inequities around Black life are constructed with inequities themselves. The problem-solution therefore is a dead end. We use this paradox as an invitation to rethink ongoing efforts to seek equity and justice more broadly, setting out a fragile but hopeful path for HCI and design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cunningham","given":"Jay L."},{"family":"Benabdallah","given":"Gabrielle"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Daniela K."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Alex S."}],"citation-key":"cunninghamGroundsSolutionismOntologies2022","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.

Bringing these long-forgotten objects back to life through hand-curated digital resources, Trettien shows how early experimental book hacks speak to the contemporary conditions of digital scholarship and publishing.\n<br/><br/>\n> Whitney Trettien’s *Cut/Copy/Paste* is a seriously delightful book, and a delightfully serious one. She travels to the fringe of the book trade to show how makers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries created assemblages from pre-existing print books, making entirely new works of art that both drew on traditional culture and simultaneously reinvented it. In the process, she herself reinvents that it means to do book history, drawing exciting parallels between the near past and our transitional moment as we move from print to digital culture.

Aiming to articulate notions of sovereignty, democracy, and freedom in affective and sensory terms, it conceives of sovereignty as an embodied practice and something that must be learned and experienced collectively over time rather than a fixed condition of a discrete individual or nation. It explores tensions between Indigenous notions of sovereignty and queer notions of the antisocial or non-sovereign, as well as recent discussions of the commons as an affective category, to offer an anti-racist and decolonial account of queer feminist affect theory and cultural politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cvetkovich","given":"Ann"}],"citation-key":"cvetkovichItFeelsRight2021","container-title":"Feminist Media Histories","container-title-short":"Feminist Media Histories","DOI":"10.1525/fmh.2021.7.2.30","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"30-64","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"“It Feels Right to Me”Queer Feminist Art Installations and the Sovereignty of the Senses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/fmh/article/7/2/30/117177/It-Feels-Right-to-Me-Queer-Feminist-Art","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"darAnalyzingTransformersEmbedding2022","abstract":"Understanding Transformer-based models has attracted significant attention, as they lie at the heart of recent technological advances across machine learning. While most interpretability methods rely on running models over inputs, recent work has shown that a zero-pass approach, where parameters are interpreted directly without a forward/backward pass is feasible for some Transformer parameters, and for two-layer attention networks. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis where all parameters of a trained Transformer are interpreted by projecting them into the embedding space, that is, the space of vocabulary items they operate on. We derive a simple theoretical framework to support our arguments and provide ample evidence for its validity. First, an empirical analysis showing that parameters of both pretrained and fine-tuned models can be interpreted in embedding space. Second, we present two applications of our framework: (a) aligning the parameters of different models that share a vocabulary, and (b) constructing a classifier without training by ``translating'' the parameters of a fine-tuned classifier to parameters of a different model that was only pretrained. Overall, our findings open the door to interpretation methods that, at least in part, abstract away from model specifics and operate in the embedding space only.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Dar","given":"Guy"},{"family":"Geva","given":"Mor"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Ankit"},{"family":"Berant","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"darAnalyzingTransformersEmbedding2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2209.02535","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,20]]},"number":"arXiv:2209.02535","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Analyzing Transformers in Embedding Space","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02535"},

  {"id":"DataIntimacyMachinic2016","abstract":"Today, machines observe, record the world – not just for us, but sometimes instead of us (in our stead), and even indifferently to us humans. And yet, remain human. Correlationism may not be up to a comprehensive ontology, but the ways in which we encounter, and struggle to make some kind of sense of, machinic sensibility matters. The nature of that encounter is not instrumentality, or even McLuhanian extension, but a full-blown ‘relationship’ where the terms by which machines ‘experience’ the world, and communicate with each other, parametrises the conditions for our own experience. This essay will play out one such relationship currently in the making: the boom in self-tracking technologies, and the attendant promise of data’s intimacy. This essay proceeds in three sections, all of which draw on a larger research project into self-tracking and contemporary data epistemologies. It thus leverages observations from close reading of self-tracking’s publicisation in the mass media between 2007 and 2016; analysis of over fifty self-tracking products, some of it through self-experimentation; and interviews and ethnographic observation, primarily of the ‘Quantified Self’ connoisseur community. The first section examines the dominant public presentations of self-tracking in early twenty-first century discourse. This discourse embraces a vision of automated and intimate self-surveillance, which is then promised to deliver superior control and objective knowledge over the self. Next, I link these promises to the recent theoretical turns towards the agency of objects and the autonomous sensory capacities of new media to consider the implications of such theories – and the technological shifts they address – for the phenomenology of the new media subject. Finally, I return to self-tracking discourse to consider its own idealisation of such a subject – what I call ‘data-sense’. I conclude by calling for a more explicit public and intellectual debate around the relationships we forge with new technologies, and the consequences they have for who – and what – is given which kinds of authority to speak the truth of the ‘self’","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,17]]},"citation-key":"DataIntimacyMachinic2016","container-title":"Communication + 1","DOI":"10.7275/R5CF9N15","ISSN":"2380-6109","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1–36","publisher":"ScholarWorks  UMass Amherst","source":"uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Data’s Intimacy: Machinic Sensibility and the Quantified Self","title-short":"Data’s Intimacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doaj.org/article/1f5969b8eb7e4d809001d5840069c4c4","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"dehghaniDecodingNeuralRepresentation2017","abstract":"Drawing from a common lexicon of semantic units, humans fashion narratives whose meaning transcends that of their individual utterances. However, while brain regions that represent lower-level semantic units, such as words and sentences, have been identified, questions remain about the neural representation of narrative comprehension, which involves inferring cumulative meaning. To address these questions, we exposed English, Mandarin, and Farsi native speakers to native language translations of the same stories during fMRI scanning. Using a new technique in natural language processing, we calculated the distributed representations of these stories (capturing the meaning of the stories in high-dimensional semantic space), and demonstrate that using these representations we can identify the specific story a participant was reading from the neural data. Notably, this was possible even when the distributed representations were calculated using stories in a different language than the participant was reading. Our results reveal that identification relied on a collection of brain regions most prominently located in the default mode network. These results demonstrate that neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.

However, comparing the results of different metrics and the works that evaluate with such metrics remains difficult, if not outright impossible. We survey the literature on fairness metrics for pre-trained language models and experimentally evaluate compatibility, including both biases in language models and in their downstream tasks. We do this by combining traditional literature survey, correlation analysis and empirical evaluations. We find that many metrics are not compatible with each other and highly depend on (i) templates, (ii) attribute and target seeds and (iii) the choice of embeddings. We also see no tangible evidence of intrinsic bias relating to extrinsic bias. These results indicate that fairness or bias evaluation remains challenging for contextualized language models, among other reasons because these choices remain subjective. To improve future comparisons and fairness evaluations, we recommend to avoid embedding-based metrics and focus on fairness evaluations in downstream tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Delobelle","given":"Pieter"},{"family":"Tokpo","given":"Ewoenam"},{"family":"Calders","given":"Toon"},{"family":"Berendt","given":"Bettina"}],"citation-key":"delobelleMeasuringFairnessBiased2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies","DOI":"10.18653/v1/2022.naacl-main.122","event-place":"Seattle, United States","event-title":"NAACL-HLT 2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"page":"1693–1706","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Seattle, United States","source":"ACLWeb","title":"Measuring Fairness with Biased Rulers: A Comparative Study on Bias Metrics for Pre-trained Language Models","title-short":"Measuring Fairness with Biased Rulers","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.122"},

We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500–1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.","author":[{"family":"Deng","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Socher","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Li","given":"Li-Jia"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Fei-Fei","given":"Li"}],"citation-key":"dengImageNetLargescaleHierarchical2009","container-title":"2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848","event-title":"2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","ISSN":"1063-6919","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"page":"248-255","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database","title-short":"ImageNet","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"denizRepresentationSemanticInformation2019","abstract":"An integral part of human language is the capacity to extract meaning from spoken and written words, but the precise relationship between brain representations of information perceived by listening versus reading is unclear. Prior neuroimaging studies have shown that semantic information in spoken language is represented in multiple regions in the human cerebral cortex, while amodal semantic information appears to be represented in a few broad brain regions. However, previous studies were too insensitive to determine whether semantic representations were shared at a fine level of detail rather than merely at a coarse scale. We used fMRI to record brain activity in two separate experiments while participants listened to or read several hours of the same narrative stories, and then created voxelwise encoding models to characterize semantic selectivity in each voxel and in each individual participant. We find that semantic tuning during listening and reading are highly correlated in most semantically selective regions of cortex, and models estimated using one modality accurately predict voxel responses in the other modality. These results suggest that the representation of language semantics is independent of the sensory modality through which the semantic information is received.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can comprehend the meaning of words from both spoken and written language. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the brain representations of spoken or written text. Here, we show that although the representation of semantic information in the human brain is quite complex, the semantic representations evoked by listening versus reading are almost identical.

Many of these examinations have focused on the contents of machine learning datasets, finding glaring underrepresentation of minoritized groups. In contrast, relatively little work has been done to examine the norms, values, and assumptions embedded in these datasets. In this work, we conceptualize machine learning datasets as a type of informational infrastructure, and motivate a genealogy as method in examining the histories and modes of constitution at play in their creation. We present a critical history of ImageNet as an exemplar, utilizing critical discourse analysis of major texts around ImageNet’s creation and impact. We find that assumptions around ImageNet and other large computer vision datasets more generally rely on three themes: the aggregation and accumulation of more data, the computational construction of meaning, and making certain types of data labor invisible.

In this paper, we survey an array of literature that provides insights into ethical considerations around crowdsourced dataset annotation. We synthesize these insights, and lay out the challenges in this space along two layers: (1) who the annotator is, and how the annotators' lived experiences can impact their annotations, and (2) the relationship between the annotators and the crowdsourcing platforms and what that relationship affords them. Finally, we put forth a concrete set of recommendations and considerations for dataset developers at various stages of the ML data pipeline: task formulation, selection of annotators, platform and infrastructure choices, dataset analysis and evaluation, and dataset documentation and release.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Díaz","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Kivlichan","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Prabhakaran","given":"Vinodkumar"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Rachel"}],"citation-key":"dentonWhoseGroundTruth2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2112.04554","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"number":"arXiv:2112.04554","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Whose Ground Truth?

  {"id":"derridaPaperMachine2005","abstract":"This book questions the book itself, archivization, machines for writing, and the mechanicity inherent in language, the media, and intellectuals. Derrida questions what takes place between the paper and the machine inscribing it. He examines what becomes of the archive when the world of paper is subsumed in new machines for virtualization, and whether there can be a virtual event or a virtual archive. Derrida continues his long-standing investigation of these issues, and ties them into the new themes that governed his teaching and thinking in the past few years: the secret, pardon, perjury, state sovereignty, hospitality, the university, animal rights, capital punishment, the question of what sort of mediatized world is replacing the print epoch, and the question of the “wholly other.” Derrida is remarkable at making seemingly occasional pieces into part of a complexly interconnected trajectory of thought.","author":[{"family":"Derrida","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"derridaPaperMachine2005","edition":"1 edition","event-place":"Stanford, Calif","ISBN":"978-0-8047-4620-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",9,23]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"222","publisher":"Stanford University Press","publisher-place":"Stanford, Calif","source":"Amazon","title":"Paper Machine","translator":[{"family":"Bowlby","given":"Rachel"}],"type":"book"},

  {"id":"deursenDigitalInequalitiesInternet2019","abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is more complex and abstract than previous information and communication technologies as there are many connections occurring. New challenges for users arise from increased amount of data, decisions made automatically, less visibility and more ambiguity, and magnified security and privacy risks. There is a fair chance that only a selective group will benefit, making it important to study IoT from a digital inequality perspective. The current study focused on health, home, and security related IoT by conducting a survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population. The study was guided by resources and appropriation theory. IoT attitudes and material access as well as educational and income differences play an important role. Those with higher education and those with higher incomes have more positive attitudes and are the first to actually buy IoT. This also means that they are the first to develop the required skills and to engage in a diverse IoT use. The results suggest that to make the IoT attractive for larger parts of the population, clear terms of use and user-friendly IoT should be an important objective. Stimulating positive attitudes towards IoT will increase the likelihood of IoT ownership, development of IoT skills, and, eventually, a wider diversity of IoT use. Policies should aim to stress the potential outcomes IoT has to offer and should promote transparency and disclosure of how personal data is used as well as better privacy, security practices and regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Deursen","given":"Alexander J.

No, not those hard words, like “koinonia” and “marocain” (Spelling Bee shoutout!). It's the small words are the ones that make lexicographers weep.

  {"id":"devMeasuresBiasesHarms2022","abstract":"Recent studies show that Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies propagate societal biases about demographic groups associated with attributes such as gender, race, and nationality. To create interventions and mitigate these biases and associated harms, it is vital to be able to detect and measure such biases. While existing works propose bias evaluation and mitigation methods for various tasks, there remains a need to cohesively understand the biases and the specific harms they measure, and how different measures compare with each other. To address this gap, this work presents a practical framework of harms and a series of questions that practitioners can answer to guide the development of bias measures. As a validation of our framework and documentation questions, we also present several case studies of how existing bias measures in NLP -- both intrinsic measures of bias in representations and extrinsic measures of bias of downstream applications -- can be aligned with different harms and how our proposed documentation questions facilitates more holistic understanding of what bias measures are measuring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Dev","given":"Sunipa"},{"family":"Sheng","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jieyu"},{"family":"Amstutz","given":"Aubrie"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jiao"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Sanseverino","given":"Mattie"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jiin"},{"family":"Nishi","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Nanyun"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kai-Wei"}],"citation-key":"devMeasuresBiasesHarms2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2108.03362","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,13]]},"number":"arXiv:2108.03362","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"On Measures of Biases and Harms in NLP","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03362"},

  {"id":"dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022","abstract":"This article argues against the conflation of digital and computational that ails contemporary critical discourse. Searching for a common logic among the three modes of computing (namely analog, digital, and quantum), it ends up finding an answer in the individuating backbone that runs through histories of postal, civic, and technological addresses. Borrowing the concept of addressability from computer science and adapting it to explain procedures of identificatory mapping at large, the article theorizes addressability as a cultural technique that can be traced back to the origins of the modern disciplinary state. In doing so, it not only posits addressability as one of the core operational logics for all computation and an alternative analytic to the digital but also suggests a longer arc of computation that considers the ubiquitous digitality as a mere subset of modern state apparatuses and their urban infrastructures. The article concludes by reflecting on this computational addressability and its relationship with ideological interpellation, proposing computation as a multiscalar assemblage of political techniken.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Dhaliwal","given":"Ranjodh Singh"}],"citation-key":"dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022","container-title":"Critical Inquiry","DOI":"10.1086/721167","ISSN":"0093-1896","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"page":"1-27","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.libproxy2.usc.edu (Atypon)","title":"On Addressability, or What Even Is Computation?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/721167","volume":"49"},

Klein, authors of Data Feminism, in conversation with Data &amp; Society’s Director of Research Sareeta Amrute.\n\nHow can feminist thinking be operationalized into more ethical and equitable data practices? As data are increasingly mobilized in the service of governments and corporations, their unequal conditions of production, asymmetrical methods of application, and unequal effects on both individuals and groups have become increasingly difficult for data scientists––and others who rely on data in their work––to ignore. But it is precisely this power that makes it worth asking: “Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science, with whose interests in mind?”\nThese are some questions that emerge from what we call data feminism; a way of thinking about data science and its communication that is informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought. This talk will draw on insights from our collaboratively crafted book about how challenges to the male/female binary can challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems; how an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization; and how the concept of “invisible labor” can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems.\n\nFor a transcript and podcast version of this talk visit: http://datasociety.net/library/data-f....\n\n\nAbout the Speakers\nCatherine D’Ignazio (she/her) is a hacker mama, scholar, and artist/designer who focuses on feminist technology, data literacy and civic engagement. She has run women’s health hackathons, designed global news recommendation systems, created talking and tweeting water quality sculptures, and led walking data visualizations to envision the future of sea level rise. Her book from MIT Press, Data Feminism, co-authored with Lauren Klein, charts a course for more ethical and empowering data science practices. D’Ignazio is an assistant professor of Urban Science and Planning in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT where she is the Director of the Data + Feminism Lab. More information about Catherine can be found on her website at www.kanarinka.com.\n\nLauren F. Klein (she/her) is a scholar and teacher whose work crosses the fields of data science, digital humanities, and early American literature. She has designed platforms for exploring the contents of historical newspapers, recreated forgotten visualization schemes with fabric and addressable LEDs, and, with her students, cooked meals from early American recipes—and then visualized the results. In 2017, she was named one of the “rising stars in digital humanities” by Inside Higher Ed. She is the author of An Archive of Taste: Race and Eating in the Early United States (University of Minnesota Press, 2020) and, with Catherine D’Ignazio, Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020). With Matthew K. Gold, she edits Debates in the Digital Humanities, a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge. Klein is an Associate Professor of English and Quantitative Theory &amp; Methods at Emory University, where she also directs the Digital Humanities Lab. More information can be found on her website: lklein.com.\n\nAbout Databites\nData & Society’s “Databites” speaker series presents timely conversations about the purpose and power of technology, bridging our interdisciplinary research with broader public conversations about the societal implications of data and automation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,7]]},"citation-key":"dignazioDatabiteNo131","dimensions":"59:41","performer":[{"family":"D'Ignazio","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Lauren"}],"source":"YouTube","title":"Databite No. 131: Data Feminism","title-short":"Databite No. 131","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su3vIF5P06M&feature=youtu.be"},

  {"id":"disalvoAdversarialDesign2012","abstract":"An exploration of the political qualities of technology design, as seen in projects that span art, computer science, and consumer products.In Adversarial Design, Carl DiSalvo examines the ways that technology design can provoke and engage the political. He describes a practice, which he terms “adversarial design,” that uses the means and forms of design to challenge beliefs, values, and what is taken to be fact. It is not simply applying design to politics―attempting to improve governance for example, by redesigning ballots and polling places; it is implicitly contestational and strives to question conventional approaches to political issues. DiSalvo explores the political qualities and potentials of design by examining a series of projects that span design and art, engineering and computer science, agitprop and consumer products. He views these projects―which include computational visualizations of networks of power and influence, therapy robots that shape sociability, and everyday objects embedded with microchips that enable users to circumvent surveillance―through the lens of agonism, a political theory that emphasizes contention as foundational to democracy. DiSalvo's illuminating analysis aims to provide design criticism with a new approach for thinking about the relationship between forms of political expression, computation as a medium, and the processes and products of design.","author":[{"family":"DiSalvo","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"disalvoAdversarialDesign2012","edition":"Reprint edition","editor":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Stolterman","given":"Erik"}],"event-place":"Place of publication not identified","ISBN":"978-0-262-52822-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"168","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Place of publication not identified","source":"Amazon","title":"Adversarial Design","type":"book"},

  {"id":"dunbar-hesterFreedomJobsLearning2016","abstract":"Resumen\n\t\t\t\t\tThis paper examines imaginaries of work and labor in “open technology” projects (especially open source software and hackerspaces), based on ethnographic research in North America. It zeroes in on “diversity initiatives” within open technology projects. These initiatives are important because they expose many of the assumptions and tensions that surround participatory cultures. On the one hand, these projects and spaces are organized around voluntarism; in theory, everyone who wishes to participate is welcome to do so. On the other hand, diversity initiatives form in order to address the “problem” of imbalance in the ranks of participants. Technology is a unique domain for the discharge of political energies. In collective imagination, it has been vested with the power to initiate change (even as this belief obscures the role of social and economic relations). Multiple ideas circulate about the relationships between diversity in open technology projects and paid labor. This paper argues that in part due to the legacy of technical hobbies as training grounds for technical employment for much of the twentieth century, as documented by historians of radio (Douglas, 1987; Haring, 2006), voluntaristic technology projects are vexed sites for imagining political emancipation. To a large degree, diversity initiatives in open technology projects are consistent with corporate values of diversity as a marketplace value.  At the same time, collectivity formations around technology that incorporate feminist, antiracist, or social justice framings may begin to generate connections between diversity advocacy in tech fields and social justice movements or policy changes in order to effect deep social change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunbar-Hester","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"dunbar-hesterFreedomJobsLearning2016","container-title":"Teknokultura.

  {"id":"dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019","abstract":"A firsthand look at efforts to improve diversity in software and hackerspace communitiesHacking, as a mode of technical and cultural production, is commonly celebrated for its extraordinary freedoms of creation and circulation. Yet surprisingly few women participate in it: rates of involvement by technologically skilled women are drastically lower in hacking communities than in industry and academia. Hacking Diversity investigates the activists engaged in free and open-source software to understand why, despite their efforts, they fail to achieve the diversity that their ideals support.Christina Dunbar-Hester shows that within this well-meaning volunteer world, beyond the sway of human resource departments and equal opportunity legislation, members of underrepresented groups face unique challenges. She brings together more than five years of firsthand research: attending software conferences and training events, working on message boards and listservs, and frequenting North American hackerspaces. She explores who participates in voluntaristic technology cultures, to what ends, and with what consequences. Digging deep into the fundamental assumptions underpinning STEM-oriented societies, Dunbar-Hester demonstrates that while the preferred solutions of tech enthusiasts―their “hacks” of projects and cultures―can ameliorate some of the “bugs” within their own communities, these methods come up short for issues of unequal social and economic power. Distributing “diversity” in technical production is not equal to generating justice.Hacking Diversity reframes questions of diversity advocacy to consider what interventions might appropriately broaden inclusion and participation in the hacking world and beyond.","author":[{"family":"Dunbar-Hester","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019","event-place":"Princeton, New Jersey","ISBN":"978-0-691-19288-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,10]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, New Jersey","source":"Amazon","title":"Hacking Diversity: The Politics of Inclusion in Open Technology Cultures","title-short":"Hacking Diversity","type":"book","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctvhrd181"},

  {"id":"eglashAIGenerativeEconomy2019","abstract":"Extractive economies pull value from a system without restoring it. Unsustainable extraction of ecological value includes over-fishing, clear-cut logging, etc. Extraction of labor value is similarly objectionable: assembly line jobs for example increase the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, depression, suicide and other problems. Extraction of social value-vacuuming up online personal information, commodification of the public sphere, and so on-constitutes a third form. But all three domains-ecological value, labor value, and social value-can thrive in unalienated forms if we can create a future of work that replaces extraction with generative cycles. AI is a key technology in developing these alternative economic forms. This paper describes some initial experiments with African, African American, and Native American artisans who were willing to experiment with the introduction of computational enhancements to their work. Following our report on these initial results, we map out a vision for how AI could scale up labor that sustains \"heritage algorithms\", ecologically situated value chains and other hybrid forms that prevent value alienation while flourishing from its robust circulation. 1 Questions such as \"what jobs will remain after AI is sufficiently advanced\" are implying a rather passive stance. True, the potential disruptions created by AI can cause trepidation. But they are also an opportunity for re-fashioning the future of work in ways that optimize environmental sustainability, sustain enjoyable labor, and enhance the public sphere. In the experiments described in this paper we investigate artisanal labor as the basis for such forms. Traditional cultural forms of production such as Native American wood crafting often embody all three domains: harvesting practices that are ecologically sustainable; labor practices that are deeply satisfying; and social networks in which both equity and creative expression can flourish (Ostrom and Ahn 2009; Corntassel 2012; Eglash 2016a,b; Liu et al 2018). If AI and related automation technologies can help to \"translate\" these forms into modes of production that fit contemporary needs and contexts, the social and environmental ills that were created by centuries of mass production-the extractive economy-could be addressed, and a generative economy-one in which value remains in an unalienated form; circulated rather than extracted-could be achieved. In this paper we will briefly review the problems created by mass production, and the principles of generative economies in their traditional form. We then present some initial experiments with what we might term \"artisanal cyborgs\"-a synthesis between traditional work practices and contemporary automation technologies. We conclude with a vision for how this research trajectory could enable the development of computational forms that merge artificial intelligence with a generative economy.","author":[{"family":"Eglash","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Robert","given":"Lionel"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Kwame"},{"family":"Lachney","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Babbitt","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"eglashAIGenerativeEconomy2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,25]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"AI for a Generative Economy: The Role of Intelligent Systems in Sustaining Unalienated Labor, Environment, and Society","title-short":"AI for a Generative Economy","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"eglashIntroductionGenerativeJustice2016","abstract":"Resumen\n\t\t\t\t\tMarx proposed that capitalism’s destructive force is caused, at root, by the alienation of labor value from its generators. Environmentalists have added the concept of unalienated ecological value, and rights activists added the unalienated expressive value of free speech, sexuality, spirituality, etc. Marx’s vision for restoring an unalienated world by top-down economic governance was never fulfilled. But in the last 30 years, new forms of social justice have emerged that operate as “bottom-up”. Peer-to-peer production such as open source software or wikipedia has challenged the corporate grip on IP in a “gift exchange” of labor value; community based agroecology establishes a kind of gift exchange with our nonhuman allies in nature. DIY citizenship from feminist makerspaces to queer biohacking has profound implications for a new materialism of the “knowledge commons”; and restorative approaches to civil rights can challenge the prison-industrial complex. In contrast to top-down “distributive justice,” all of the above are cases of bottom-up or “generative justice”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Eglash","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"eglashIntroductionGenerativeJustice2016","container-title":"Teknokultura.

  {"id":"elhagryThoroughReviewRecent2021","abstract":"Image Captioning is a task that combines computer vision and natural language processing, where it aims to generate descriptive legends for images. It is a two-fold process relying on accurate image understanding and correct language understanding both syntactically and semantically. It is becoming increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest research and findings in the field of image captioning due to the growing amount of knowledge available on the topic. There is not, however, enough coverage of those findings in the available review papers. We perform in this paper a run-through of the current techniques, datasets, benchmarks and evaluation metrics used in image captioning. The current research on the field is mostly focused on deep learning-based methods, where attention mechanisms along with deep reinforcement and adversarial learning appear to be in the forefront of this research topic. In this paper, we review recent methodologies such as UpDown, OSCAR, VIVO, Meta Learning and a model that uses conditional generative adversarial nets. Although the GAN-based model achieves the highest score, UpDown represents an important basis for image captioning and OSCAR and VIVO are more useful as they use novel object captioning. This review paper serves as a roadmap for researchers to keep up to date with the latest contributions made in the field of image caption generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Elhagry","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Kadaoui","given":"Karima"}],"citation-key":"elhagryThoroughReviewRecent2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,27]]},"number":"arXiv:2107.13114","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Thorough Review on Recent Deep Learning Methodologies for Image Captioning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13114","version":"1"},

  {"id":"engdahlTranstemporalityOnlinePerformance2016","abstract":"This article examines notions of temporality of online performance as a way to rethink earlier debates about performance ontologies. Today, online, and increasingly mobile, technological activities such as photo and video sharing, instant messaging, blogging and social networking organise around performance practitioners’ day-to-day existence. In this networked society, performances are constantly mediated through the prism of myriads of digital platforms. Because performances are enacted within or supported by digitally mediated networks and, this is crucial, they incessantly expand temporally, I will refer to online performance in terms of transtemporality, rather than depend on an ontology of unmediation and presence. I depart from Rebecca Schneider's Performance Remains (2011) where she argues how notions of performance, reiteration and documentation are intertwined and contingent, and from the recent performative answers to the logic of the archive found in Amelia Jones's and Adrian Heathfield's anthology Perform Repeat Record: Live Art in History (2012). I argue, by illustrations of Adam Weinert's performance work (2013–2014) as well as my own (2010–2012), that online performance is never fully present but immanently distended through remediation. Performances participate in inherently ruptured transtemporal networks (tweets, reperformances, blogging, video sharing) through which they are continuously remediated and transformed. I propose that online performance even might suggest that performance continuously escapes a sense of Being. Performance's ontology, or rather its ontogenesis proposed by Heathfield (2012), resides with the elements of transformation inherent in its online remediations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Engdahl","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"engdahlTranstemporalityOnlinePerformance2016","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2016.1224339","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"page":"107-110","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Transtemporality of Online Performance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2016.1224339","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"entrialgoC5AutopoieticDatabase","abstract":"This paper examines in detail and positions two possible approaches to autopoietic database. The first is the cellular automata approach well known in the discipline of artificial life. The second is based on third order structural coupling drawn from autopoietic systems theory. The first approach is being born out in the present genealogical trajectory of database theory, design and development. Database is moving toward an object-oriented foundation, where objects express a high degree of autonomy. This trajectory still places heavy emphasis on traditional computer science notions of information processing and database as a discrete, organized collection of modeled data, and there are reasons to suspect that such databases are not yet fully autopoietic, although this is not ruled out. The second approach allows for analysis of social interactions of data that occur in poorly defined problem domains of active semiosis, and the mingling of variously encoded data and communication. Although in many ways antithetical to traditional notions of information processing and database ontology, the second (non-model) approach could be useful in evaluating systems where traditional data mining techniques (model based prediction) are impractical. Possible applications for this approach are speculated, and a number of art projects by C5 are cited as examples.","author":[{"family":"Entrialgo","given":"Frédérique"}],"citation-key":"entrialgoC5AutopoieticDatabase","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"C5: Toward Autopoietic Database","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"eysenckAnxietyDepressionOverlapping2018","abstract":"This Special Issue of Cognition and Emotion addresses one of the cardinal concerns of affective science, which is overlapping and distinctive features of anxiety and depression. A central finding in the study of anxiety and depression is that they are moderately highly correlated with each other. This leads us to the question: What is behind this co-occurrence? Possible explanations relate to poor discriminant validity of measures; both emotional states are associated with negative affect; stressful life events; impaired cognitive processes; they share a common biological/genetic diathesis. However, despite a set of common (nonspecific) features, anxiety and depression are clearly not identical emotional states. Differences between them might be best viewed, for example, through their heterogeneous and multi-layered nature, adaptive functions and relations with regulatory processes, positive affect, and motivation or complex cognitive processes. In this introduction we consider several approaches (e.g. functional approach; tripartite model and content-specificity hypothesis) to which most research in this Special Issue is relevant. In addition, we have asked contributors to this Special Issue to indicate how their own studies on comparisons between anxiety and depression and models on anxiety and depression move this area of research to more mature science with applicability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Eysenck","given":"Michael W."},{"family":"Fajkowska","given":"Małgorzata"}],"citation-key":"eysenckAnxietyDepressionOverlapping2018","container-title":"Cognition and Emotion","DOI":"10.1080/02699931.2017.1330255","ISSN":"0269-9931","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,3]]},"page":"1391-1400","PMID":"28608767","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Anxiety and depression: toward overlapping and distinctive features","title-short":"Anxiety and depression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2017.1330255","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"falconerDemonstratingMoodRepair2015","abstract":"Objectives. The clinical signiﬁcance of self-criticism and self-compassion has prompted the development of questionnaires assessing these constructs. However, there is a lack of measures assessing their interaction within speciﬁc contexts and potential involvement in mood repair processes. Design. To rectify this, we developed the Self-Compassion and Self-Criticism Scales (SCCS), based on responses to speciﬁc scenarios, and examined its psychometric properties in an online survey and an experimental situation.\nMethod. In study 1, standard psychometric procedures were used to investigate the reliability and validity of the SCCS. In study 2, an experimental challenge involving a difﬁcult language task was used to test its sensitivity to change.\nResults. In study 1, exploratory factor analysis (n = 413) showed a clear two-factor structure of the SCCS denoting two orthogonal scales, with high internal validity (a ≥ .87). Correlations between the SCCS and existing measures also demonstrated appropriate convergent validity. Study 2 (n = 90) provided preliminary evidence that the SCCS can detect changes in self-appraisals. Participants receiving no performance feedback from the challenge task showed reduced state self-criticism and increased state self-compassion, demonstrating mood repair.\nConclusions. The SCCS has promise as a situational measure of self-compassion and self-criticism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Falconer","given":"Caroline J."},{"family":"King","given":"John A."},{"family":"Brewin","given":"Chris R."}],"citation-key":"falconerDemonstratingMoodRepair2015","container-title":"Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice","container-title-short":"Psychol Psychother Theory Res Pract","DOI":"10.1111/papt.12056","ISSN":"14760835","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",12]]},"language":"en","page":"351-365","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Demonstrating mood repair with a situation-based measure of self-compassion and self-criticism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/papt.12056","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"faziDistractionMachinesAugmentation2020","abstract":"It is often argued (and feared) that the human capacity to pay attention is being transformed by computational technologies. Are computing machines distraction machines? This article takes this question as its starting point in order to address concerns about attention deficits vis-à-vis questions and issues about the mechanisation of cognitive procedures. I will claim that, when approaching the attention ecology of the twenty-first century, it is necessary to differentiate between augmentation and automation. While augmentation implies the extension of predefined forms or modes of behaviour, contemporary developments in computational automation ask us instead to consider the possibility of moving beyond phenomenological analogies. The article will thus discuss how transformations in the capacity to pay attention in a computational age need to be analysed in relation to the emergence of quasi-autonomous artificial cognitive agents driven by AI technologies, such as those known as machine learning. I will argue that these artificial cognitive agents can no longer be described in terms of technological add-ons to pre-existing human cognitive capacities. Today, we think alongside machines that are, is a sense, already thinking. Similarly, we pay attention alongside machines that are, in a sense, already paying attention. The challenge for philosophy and cultural theory is that of moving beyond ‘projectionist’ conceptions of such technological agency. This challenge, however, also involves overcoming the anthropomorphism that is implicit in expression such as ‘thinking machines’. In a century where robot-to-robot communications have outpaced and outnumbered human-machine interactions, these artificial cognitive agents are not just reframing the human capacity to pay attention: they are also re-structuring the conditions for such capacity. Addressing the conditions for attention beyond augmentation and vis-à-vis computational automation involves considering the role and scope of both human and algorithmic decision-making, and engaging with the ways in which the humanities can intervene upon contemporary complex cognitive scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Fazi","given":"M.

  {"id":"feltCyberpunkOtherHackers2019","abstract":"This article locates an alternate paradigm of hacking in feminist cyberfiction, notably, James Tiptree, Jr.’s proto-cyberpunk novella, “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” (1973). I argue this story critically reorients our understanding of how information technologies and their material artifacts construct and reinforce norms of able-bodiedness and ability. Drawing on archival materials from Bell System, early information theory, and crip theory, my reading reveals that Tiptree’s portrayal of disability is tied to a cybernetic conception of error and noise. These frictions between users and their machine interfaces materialize unexamined performances of critical labor and noncompliance that I link to the emerging field of crip technoscience. Tracking these disruptions in cybernetic feedback across “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” and in historical accounts of the telephone switchboard operator, I show that error and noise underpin an early example of a feminist hacking ethos, and also crip accounts of electronic disembodiment often imputed to information society and cyberpunk fiction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Felt","given":"Lindsey Dolich"}],"citation-key":"feltCyberpunkOtherHackers2019","container-title":"Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience","DOI":"10.28968/cftt.v5i1.29615","ISSN":"2380-3312","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2019 Lindsey Dolich Felt","number":"1","page":"1-34","source":"catalystjournal.org","title":"Cyberpunk's Other Hackers: The Girls Who Were Plugged In","title-short":"Cyberpunk's Other Hackers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/29615","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"ferrandoFeministGenealogyPosthuman2016","abstract":"This article aims to reassemble a feminist genealogy of the posthuman in the arts, with a specific focus on the visual works conceived by female artists after the rise of what has been retrospectively defined as first-wave Feminism. Starting with the main avant-garde movements of the first half of the twentieth century—specifically, Futurism, Dadaism and Surrealism—this genealogy analyses the second-wave Feminism of the 1960s and 1970s, with its integral exploration of the body highlighted by performance art. Following this, it takes into account the third-wave Feminism of the 1990s and its radical re-elaboration of the self: from Cyberfeminism and its revisitation of technology, to the artistic insights offered, on the one side, by critical techno-orientalist readings of the futures, and on the other, by the political and social articulations of Afrofuturism and Chicanafuturism. Lastly, this genealogy accesses the ways contemporary female artists are dealing with gender, social media and the notion of embodiment, touching upon elements that will become of key importance in fourth-wave Feminism. This article is published as part of a collection dedicated to multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives on gender studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrando","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"ferrandoFeministGenealogyPosthuman2016","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","DOI":"10.1057/palcomms.2016.11","ISSN":"2055-1045","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,10]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 Nature Publishing Group","page":"16011","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A feminist genealogy of posthuman aesthetics in the visual arts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201611","volume":"2"},

Its reflections are sustained by empirical data obtained between November 2010 and January 2011, when the author engaged in a study related to Gender and Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Cybernetics, University of Reading (England) under the supervision of Professor Kevin Warwick, known as the first human cyborg for his experiments “Cyborg I” (1998) and “Cyborg II” (2002). In this context, the author formulated a questionnaire which was answered by more than one hundred students and researchers of the Department. The specific question motivating this research was: how and to what extent do gender and the intersectional differences characterizing the human species inform the development of cyborgs, robots and AI? The results of the questionnaire, presented in this article, offer original and controversial perspectives on how such epistemological approaches may impact the futures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrando","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"ferrandoPosthumanPostwomanCyborgs2014","container-title":"European Journal of Futures Research","container-title-short":"Eur J Futures Res","DOI":"10.1007/s40309-014-0043-8","ISSN":"2195-2248","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,31]]},"language":"en","page":"43","source":"Springer Link","title":"Is the post-human a post-woman?

Students, researchers and faculty will find a comprehensive overview of educational practices pertaining to innovation fields such as digital media, 3D printing, agile development, physical computing, games, dance, collaboration, teacher education and online learning. This volume fills an important gap in the literature on creative computation, as practitioners are rarely challenged to reflect on or share their teaching practices. How do we design effective inter-, multi-, cross- and trans-disciplinary pedagogy and curricula? Brought together here are essays on the pedagogies that produce the so-called 'unicorns' - graduates who can code and create. Here, the intertwining of (what many consider mutually exclusive) artistic sensitivities and computational skills plays an essential role, calling forth a new kind of undergraduate curriculum attuned to the interweaving of skillsets and theoretic knowledge needed to create and innovate with ever-changing technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"citation-key":"filimowiczTeachingComputationalCreativity2017","DOI":"10.1017/9781316481165","editor":[{"family":"Filimowicz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tzankova","given":"Veronika"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-107-13804-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Teaching Computational Creativity","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/teaching-computational-creativity/0705D943E7A0AF75FA0947FC9D70B2EB"},

  {"id":"finnWhatAlgorithmsWant2017","abstract":"We depend on – we believe in – algorithms to help us get a ride, choose which book to buy, execute a mathematical proof. It's as if we think of code as a magic spell, an incantation to reveal what we need to know and even what we want. Humans have always believed that certain invocations – the marriage vow, the shaman's curse – do not merely describe the world but make it. Computation casts a cultural shadow that is shaped by this long tradition of magical thinking. In this book, Ed Finn considers how the algorithm – in practical terms, \"\"a method for solving a problem\"\" – has its roots not only in mathematical logic but also in cybernetics, philosophy, and magical thinking. Finn argues that the algorithm deploys concepts from the idealized space of computation in a messy reality, with unpredictable and sometimes fascinating results. Drawing on sources that range from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash to Diderot's Encyclop#65533;die, from Adam Smith to the Star Trek computer, Finn explores the gap between theoretical ideas and pragmatic instructions. He examines the development of intelligent assistants like Siri, the rise of algorithmic aesthetics at Netflix, Ian Bogost's satiric Facebook game Cow Clicker, and the revolutionary economics of Bitcoin. He describes Google's goal of anticipating our questions, Uber's cartoon maps and black box accounting, and what Facebook tells us about programmable value, among other things. If we want to understand the gap between abstraction and messy reality, Finn argues, we need to build a model of \"\"algorithmic reading\"\" and scholarship that attends to process, spearheading a new experimental humanities.","author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Ed"}],"citation-key":"finnWhatAlgorithmsWant2017","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","ISBN":"978-0-262-03592-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,10]]},"language":"English","publisher":"MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","title":"What Algorithms Want : Imagination in the Age of Computing","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/[SITE_ID]/detail.action?docID=4819947"},

It also highlights the limitations of these LLMs, such as their brittleness (susceptibility to catastrophic failure), unreliability (false or made-up information), and the occasional inability to make elementary logical inferences or deal with simple mathematics. The article concludes that LLMs, represent a decoupling of agency and intelligence.

  {"id":"forsImaginingPersonalData2020","abstract":"Digital self-tracking devices and data have become normal elements of everyday life. Imagining Personal Data examines the implications of the rise of body monitoring and digital self-tracking for how we inhabit, experience and imagine our everyday worlds and futures. Through a focus on how it feels to live in environments where data is emergent, present and characterized by a sense of uncertainty, the authors argue for a new interdisciplinary approach to understanding the implications of self-tracking, which attends to its past, present and possible future. Building on social science approaches, the book accounts for the concerns of scholars working in design, philosophy and human-computer interaction. It problematizes the body and senses in relation to data and tracking devices, presents an accessible analytical account of the sensory and affective experiences of self-tracking, and questions the status of big data. In doing so it proposes an agenda for future research and design that puts people at its centre.","author":[{"family":"Fors","given":"Vaike"},{"family":"Pink","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Berg","given":"Martin"},{"family":"O'Dell","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"forsImaginingPersonalData2020","DOI":"10.4324/9781003085676","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-00-308567-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,4]]},"number-of-pages":"176","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London","title":"Imagining Personal Data: Experiences of Self-Tracking","title-short":"Imagining Personal Data","type":"book"},

  {"id":"freyArtificialIntelligenceInclusion2020","abstract":"Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project—a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago—we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Frey","given":"William R."},{"family":"Patton","given":"Desmond U."},{"family":"Gaskell","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"McGregor","given":"Kyle A."}],"citation-key":"freyArtificialIntelligenceInclusion2020","container-title":"Social Science Computer Review","container-title-short":"Social Science Computer Review","DOI":"10.1177/0894439318788314","ISSN":"0894-4393","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"42-56","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion: Formerly Gang-Involved Youth as Domain Experts for Analyzing Unstructured Twitter Data","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439318788314","volume":"38"},

However, the progress in language style transfer is lagged behind other domains, such as computer vision, mainly because of the lack of parallel data and principle evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose to learn style transfer with non-parallel data. We explore two models to achieve this goal, and the key idea behind the proposed models is to learn separate content representations and style representations using adversarial networks. We also propose novel evaluation metrics which measure two aspects of style transfer: transfer strength and content preservation. We access our models and the evaluation metrics on two tasks: paper-news title transfer, and positive-negative review transfer. Results show that the proposed content preservation metric is highly correlate to human judgments, and the proposed models are able to generate sentences with higher style transfer strength and similar content preservation score comparing to auto-encoder.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Zhenxin"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Xiaoye"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Nanyun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Dongyan"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Rui"}],"citation-key":"fuStyleTransferText2017","container-title":"arXiv:1711.06861 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,18]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Style Transfer in Text: Exploration and Evaluation","title-short":"Style Transfer in Text","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06861"},

  {"id":"gallagherASMRAutobiographiesLife2019","abstract":"For years now, a growing online subculture has been exchanging videos designed to induce ‘autonomous sensory meridian response’ (ASMR), a mysterious, blissfully relaxing tingling sensation held to alleviate anxiety, pain, insomnia and depression. Emerging from online health forums, ASMR culture today centres on YouTube, where ‘ASMRtists’ have used the feedback mechanisms built into social media platforms to refine a repertoire of ‘trigger’ techniques. Exemplifying a wider trend for using ‘ambient media’ as mood modulators and task facilitators (Roquet, 2016 Ambient Media: Japanese Atmospheres of Self. London: University of Minnesota Press.), ASMR culture’s use of the word ‘trigger’ is telling, gesturing towards what Halberstam ((2014) You Are Triggering Me! The Neo-Liberal Rhetoric of Harm, Danger and Trauma. Bully Bloggers. Available at: https://bullybloggers.wordpress.com/2014/07/05/you-are-triggering-me-the-neo-liberal-rhetoric-of-harm-danger-and-trauma/ (accessed 8 August 2018)) sees as a shift away from the Freudian notion of ‘memory as a palimpsest’ towards one of memory as ‘a live wire sitting in the psyche waiting for a spark’, whereby digital subjects become black-boxed nodes in a cybernetic circuit. This shift has serious implications for the humanities and is particularly resonant for scholars of life-writing. As McNeill ((2012) There is no “I” in network: Social networks sites and posthuman auto/biography. Biography 35(1): 65–82.) argues, digital technologies ‘complicate[] definitions of the self and its boundaries, both dismantling and sustaining the humanist subject in practices of personal narrative’ (p. 65). The resulting friction is highlighted in ‘ASMR autobiographies’: texts narrating the author’s experiences of ASMR and their discovery of online ASMR communities. Echoing familiar auto/biographical forms, from medical case histories and coming out narratives to tales of religious conversion, these texts show that the models of subjectivity we have inherited from Enlightenment philosophy, religion, psychology and Romantic literature retain some cultural purchase. But they also suggest digital media are fostering new understandings of personhood informed by cybernetics, evolutionary psychology, behaviourism and neuroscience. Focusing on works by Andrew MacMuiris, Andrea Seigel and Jon Kersey while also addressing a range of other texts, this article asks what ASMR autobiographies can tell us about digital subjectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gallagher","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"gallagherASMRAutobiographiesLife2019","container-title":"Convergence","container-title-short":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/1354856518818072","ISSN":"1354-8565","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"260-277","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘ASMR’ autobiographies and the (life-)writing of digital subjectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856518818072","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"gaoComparingScientificAbstracts2022","abstract":"Background Large language models such as ChatGPT can produce increasingly realistic text, with unknown information on the accuracy and integrity of using these models in scientific writing.\nMethods We gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated.\nResults All ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journal’s formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing.\nConclusion ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Catherine A."},{"family":"Howard","given":"Frederick M."},{"family":"Markov","given":"Nikolay S."},{"family":"Dyer","given":"Emma C."},{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Siddhi"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Pearson","given":"Alexander T."}],"citation-key":"gaoComparingScientificAbstracts2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.12.23.521610","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,27]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

We investigate the extent to which pretrained LMs can be prompted to generate toxic language, and the effectiveness of controllable text generation algorithms at preventing such toxic degeneration. We create and release RealToxicityPrompts, a dataset of 100K naturally occurring, sentence-level prompts derived from a large corpus of English web text, paired with toxicity scores from a widely-used toxicity classifier. Using RealToxicityPrompts, we find that pretrained LMs can degenerate into toxic text even from seemingly innocuous prompts. We empirically assess several controllable generation methods, and find that while data- or compute-intensive methods (e.g., adaptive pretraining on non-toxic data) are more effective at steering away from toxicity than simpler solutions (e.g., banning \"bad\" words), no current method is failsafe against neural toxic degeneration. To pinpoint the potential cause of such persistent toxic degeneration, we analyze two web text corpora used to pretrain several LMs (including GPT-2; Radford et. al, 2019), and find a significant amount of offensive, factually unreliable, and otherwise toxic content.

  {"id":"gevaAreWeModeling2019","abstract":"Crowdsourcing has been the prevalent paradigm for creating natural language understanding datasets in recent years. A common crowdsourcing practice is to recruit a small number of high-quality workers, and have them massively generate examples. Having only a few workers generate the majority of examples raises concerns about data diversity, especially when workers freely generate sentences. In this paper, we perform a series of experiments showing these concerns are evident in three recent NLP datasets. We show that model performance improves when training with annotator identiﬁers as features, and that models are able to recognize the most productive annotators. Moreover, we show that often models do not generalize well to examples from annotators that did not contribute to the training set. Our ﬁndings suggest that annotator bias should be monitored during dataset creation, and that test set annotators should be disjoint from training set annotators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Geva","given":"Mor"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Berant","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"gevaAreWeModeling2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)","DOI":"10.18653/v1/D19-1107","event-place":"Hong Kong, China","event-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"1161-1166","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Hong Kong, China","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Are We Modeling the Task or the Annotator?

  {"id":"gibbsWritingMethodAttunement2015","abstract":"‘We do not lack communication. On the contrary, we have too much of it. We lack creation. We lack resistance to the present’, writes Gilles Deleuze (1994, p. 108). This is an assertion that runs counter to dominant discourses about academic writing, yet I will argue here that writing is a critical form of resistance to important aspects of the present, including the injunction to communicate in ways codified by the academy. Method, I aim to show, refers not only to the process of research but also to the process of making sense of that research in and through a writing that does not come afterward as a ‘writing up’ of what has previously been discovered, but is actually continuous with it, and, in large part, produces it. Writing in the Humanities, and increasingly in the Social Sciences, does not comprise an aftereffect of research, but forms its very fabric. Writing is not a transparent medium, nor something that comes somehow after the event, a simple ‘outcome’ of research that always takes place elsewhere, in the archive, in the field or the focus group, on the Web, but is a mode of inquiry in its own right. Thinking about the idea of writing as research in the late 1980s and early ‘90s, Australian theorists used the term ‘fictocriticism’ to describe ‘a way of writing for which there is no blueprint and which must be constantly invented anew in the face of the singular problems that arise in the course of engagement with what is researched’ (Gibbs, 2005). On the one hand this was thought by feminist theorists as an attempt to surprise the paternalistic voices of theory in action, to unveil them and reveal them for the partial rather than the universal view they in fact represent (Gibbs, 2005).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"gibbsWritingMethodAttunement2015","container-title":"Affective Methodologies: Developing Cultural Research Strategies for the Study of Affect","DOI":"10.1057/9781137483195_11","editor":[{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Britta Timm"},{"family":"Stage","given":"Carsten"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-48319-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"222-236","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"Writing as Method: Attunement, Resonance, and Rhythm","title-short":"Writing as Method","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137483195_11"},

While ground truth refers to a set of remote sensing practices, it has a longer history in operational photography, such as aerial reconnaissance. Building on a discussion of this history, this article argues that ground truth has shifted from a reference to the physical, geographical ground to the surface of the images echoing earlier points raised by philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy that there is a ground of the image that is central to the task of analysis beyond representational practices. Furthermore, building on the practices of pattern recognition, composite imaging, and different interpretational techniques, we discuss contemporary practices of machine learning that mobilizes geographical earth observation datasets for experimental purposes, including tests such as “fake geography” as well as artistic practices, to show how ground truth is operationalized in such contexts of AI and visual arts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gil-Fournier","given":"Abelardo"},{"family":"Parikka","given":"Jussi"}],"citation-key":"gil-fournierGroundTruthFake2021","container-title":"AI & SOCIETY","container-title-short":"AI & Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s00146-020-01062-3","ISSN":"1435-5655","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1253-1262","source":"Springer Link","title":"Ground truth to fake geographies: machine vision and learning in visual practices","title-short":"Ground truth to fake geographies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01062-3","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"gilbertCompassionateMindTraining2006","abstract":"Compassionate mind training (CMT) was developed for people with high shame and self-criticism, whose problems tend to be chronic, and who find self-warmth and self-acceptance difficult and/or frightening. This paper offers a short overview of the role of shame and self-criticism in psychological difficulties, the importance of considering different types of affect system (activating versus soothing) and the theory and therapy process of CMT. The paper explores patient acceptability, understanding, abilities to utilize and practice compassion focused processes and the effectiveness of CMT from an uncontrolled trial. Six patients attending a cognitive–behavioural-based day centre for chronic difficulties completed 12 two-hour sessions in compassionate mind training. They were advised that this was part of a research programme to look at the process and effectiveness of CMT and to become active collaborators, advising the researchers on what was helpful and what was not. Results showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, self-criticism, shame, inferiority and submissive behaviour. There was also a significant increase in the participants' ability to be self-soothing and focus on feelings of warmth and reassurance for the self. Compassionate mind training may be a useful addition for some patients with chronic difficulties, especially those from traumatic backgrounds, who may lack a sense of inner warmth or abilities to be self-soothing.

  {"id":"gilbertCriticizingReassuringOneself2004","abstract":"Objectives: Self-critical people, compared with those who self-reassure, are at increased risk of psychopathology. However, there has been little work on the different forms and functions of these self-experiences. This study developed two self-report scales to measure forms and functions of self-criticism and self-reassurance and explore their relationship to depression. Methods: A self-report scale measuring forms of self-criticism and self-reassuring, and a scale measuring possible functions of self-criticism, together with a measure of depression and another self-criticism scale (LOSC), were given to 246 female students. Results: Self-criticizing vs. self-reassuring separated into two components. Forms of self-criticizing separated into two components related to: being self-critical, dwelling on mistakes and sense of inadequacy; and a second component of wanting to hurt the self and feeling self-disgust/hate. The reasons/functions for self-criticism separated into two components. One was related to desires to try to self-improve (called self-improving/correction), and the other to take revenge on, harm or hurt the self for failures (called self-harming/persecuting). Mediation analysis suggested that wanting to harm the self may be particularly pathogenic and is positively mediated by the effects of hating the self and negatively mediated by being able to self-reassure and focus on one's positives. Conclusions: Self-criticism is not a single process but has different forms, functions, and underpinning emotions. This indicates a need for more detailed research into the variations of self-criticism and the mechanisms for developing self-reassurance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"P."},{"family":"Clarke","given":"M."},{"family":"Hempel","given":"S."},{"family":"Miles","given":"J.

  {"id":"gilbertFearsCompassionHappiness2012","abstract":"Background. There is increasing research to suggest that fears of, and resistances to, affiliative and positive emotions are linked to self-criticism and a range of psychopathologies. It is unclear how these fears and resistances are linked to each other and how these in turn are linked to psychological processes, such as abilities to be mindful and recognize and describe emotions. Objectives. This research explores the relationship between fears of compassion and happiness in general, with capacities for emotional processing (alexithymia), capacities for mindfulness, and empathic abilities. To advance this research, a new scale was developed to measure general fears of positive feelings – the Fear of Happiness Scale. Results. The results showed that fears of compassion for self, from others and in particular fear of happiness, were highly linked to different aspects of alexithymia, mindfulness, empathy, self-criticism and depression, anxiety and stress. Especially noteworthy was the very high correlation between fear of happiness and depression (r= .70). Conclusion. While the development of positive emotions, especially those linked to affiliation and connectedness are increasingly seen as important therapeutic targets, little research has focused on the blocks and fears to positive emotions. This study used newly developed fears of positive affect scales (e.g., compassion and happiness) to explore these aspects and found they were significantly linked to psychopathology variables self-criticism and difficulties such as alexithymia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Gilbert","given":"P."},{"family":"McEwan","given":"K."},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"L."},{"family":"Chotai","given":"S."},{"family":"Duarte","given":"J."},{"family":"Matos","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"gilbertFearsCompassionHappiness2012","container-title":"Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice","DOI":"10.1111/j.2044-8341.2011.02046.x","ISSN":"2044-8341","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2011 The British Psychological Society","page":"374-390","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fears of compassion and happiness in relation to alexithymia, mindfulness, and self-criticism","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8341.2011.02046.x","volume":"85"},

Communication and media scholars have increasingly taken theoretical perspectives originating in science and technology studies (STS), while some STS scholars interested in information technologies have linked their research to media studies inquiries into the symbolic dimensions of these tools. In this volume, scholars from both fields come together to advance this view of media technologies as complex sociomaterial phenomena. The contributors first address the relationship between materiality and mediation, considering such topics as the lived realities of network infrastructure. The contributors then highlight media technologies as always in motion, held together through the minute, unobserved work of many, including efforts to keep these technologies alive.ContributorsPablo J.

But beyond their instrumentation within systems of power, this paper proposes that at the foundation level of algorithmic design there are a series of assumptions about what constitutes legitimate thought processes. These assumptions are based on neurotypical modes of thought and often ignore the possibilities of more neurodiverse thinking, which is regularly devalued in our society. This naturalised “whiteness” that lies at the centre of and colonises algorithmic programming needs to be interrogated and rethought, it is argued, in order to break the relationships between algorithms and oppressive power systems. Drawing on fugitive and devalued modes of thought such as queer kinship and failure, black sociality and the incomputability at the heart of the mathematical concept of Omega, the article speculates on the conception of a minor algorithmic value or “life” closer to that of an emergent collective and ecological consciousness than that of the dominant individualised and fixed model that is valued within contemporary capitalism.","author":[{"family":"Goodman","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"goodmanSecretLifeAlgorithms","language":"en","page":"22","source":"Zotero","title":"The Secret Life of Algorithms: speculation on queered futures of neurodiverse analgorithmic feeling and consciousness","type":"article-journal"},

The ways of pulling data together into a digital subject is often presented as a logic of fact, where data is equated with documentary evidence. Instead, I propose the notion of the distance in which digital subjects are produced.

This claim to authentic subjectivity is grounded in the promise of access to the “real person” as a biologically unique identity. Establishing the supposed truth of such identities is often done through using techniques such as facial biometrics. I demonstrate how contemporary data modalities construct biologically unique identities and authentic subjectivities as two end poles connected through data practices. These practices seek to designate “reality” in order to establish their own validity and usefulness. Overall, I argue that current data practices designate the face and the body as “the real world” to generate further forms of abstraction that can be anchored upon the indexical promises of physical truths.

  {"id":"grayFeministDataEthics2021","abstract":"This article conceptualises and provides an initial roadmap for operationalising a feminist data ethics of care framework for the subfield of artificial intelligence (‘AI’) known as ‘machine learning’. After outlining the principles and praxis that comprise our framework, and then using it to evaluate the current state of mainstream AI ethics content, we argue that this literature tends to be overly abstract and founded on a heteropatriarchal world view. We contend that because most AI ethics content fails to equitably and explicitly assign responsibility to actors in the machine learning economy, there is a risk of implicitly reinforcing the status quo of gender power relations and other substantive inequalities, which contribute to the significant gap between AI ethics principles and applied AI ethics more broadly. We argue that our feminist data ethics of care framework can help to fill this gap by paying particular attention to both the ‘who’ and the ‘how’, as well as by outlining a range of methods, approaches, and best practices that societal actors can use now to make interventions into the machine learning economy. Critically, feminist data ethics of care is unlikely to be achieved in this context unless all stakeholders, including women, men, and non-binary and transgender people, take responsibility for this much needed work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Witt","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"grayFeministDataEthics2021","container-title":"First Monday","DOI":"10.5210/fm.v26i12.11833","ISSN":"1396-0466","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,8]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2021 First Monday","source":"firstmonday.org","title":"A feminist data ethics of care for machine learning: The what, why, who and how","title-short":"A feminist data ethics of care for machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11833"},
  {"id":"grbaDeepElseCritical2022","abstract":"From a small community of pioneering artists who experimented with artificial intelligence (AI) in the 1970s, AI art has expanded, gained visibility, and attained socio-cultural relevance since the second half of the 2010s. Its topics, methodologies, presentational formats, and implications are closely related to a range of disciplines engaged in the research and application of AI. In this paper, I present a comprehensive framework for the critical exploration of AI art. It comprises the context of AI art, its prominent poetic features, major issues, and possible directions. I address the poetic, expressive, and ethical layers of AI art practices within the context of contemporary art, AI research, and related disciplines. I focus on the works that exemplify poetic complexity and manifest the epistemic or political ambiguities indicative of a broader milieu of contemporary culture, AI science/technology, economy, and society. By comparing, acknowledging, and contextualizing both their accomplishments and shortcomings, I outline the prospective strategies to advance the field. The aim of this framework is to expand the existing critical discourse of AI art with new perspectives which can be used to examine the creative attributes of emerging practices and to assess their cultural significance and socio-political impact. It contributes to rethinking and redefining the art/science/technology critique in the age when the arts, together with science and technology, are becoming increasingly responsible for changing ecologies, shaping cultural values, and political normalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Grba","given":"Dejan"}],"citation-key":"grbaDeepElseCritical2022","container-title":"Digital","DOI":"10.3390/digital2010001","ISSN":"2673-6470","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"1-32","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Deep Else: A Critical Framework for AI Art","title-short":"Deep Else","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-6470/2/1/1","volume":"2"},
  {"id":"greenDataSciencePolitical2021","abstract":"<p>In response to public scrutiny of data-driven algorithms, the field of data science has adopted ethics training and principles. Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people’s lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance—a fundamentally conservative one—and why data science’s attempts to promote “social good” dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Green","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"greenDataSciencePolitical2021","container-title":"Journal of Social Computing","DOI":"10.23919/JSC.2021.0029","ISSN":"2688-5255","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-265","publisher":"清华大学出版社","source":"www.sciopen.com","title":"Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice","title-short":"Data Science as Political Action","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciopen.com/article/10.23919/JSC.2021.0029","volume":"2"},

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ($\\approx 15$ years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Greff","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Rupesh Kumar"},{"family":"Koutník","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Steunebrink","given":"Bas R."},{"family":"Schmidhuber","given":"Jürgen"}],"citation-key":"greffLSTMSearchSpace2017","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"greweChillsDifferentSensory2011","abstract":"‘Chills’ (frisson manifested as goose bumps or shivers) have been used in an increasing number of studies as indicators of emotions in response to music (e.g., Craig, 2005; Guhn, Hamm, & Zentner, 2007; McCrae, 2007; Panksepp, 1995; Sloboda, 1991). In this study we present evidence that chills can be induced through aural, visual, tactile, and gustatory stimulation. Additionally, chills were elicited by mere mental self-stimulation — even without any external stimulus. Subjective ratings and physiological responses (i.e., skin conductance response, heart rate, breathing rate) of 36 participants reporting chills were recorded in response to stimuli of the named sensory domains. Chills in response to all external stimuli showed similar physiological correlates. However, they differed in the subjective affective perception: more chills occurred in response to negative valent and arousing sounds and pictures, while more chills were reported for positive valent music independent of arousal. These findings suggest that the chill phenomenon could be a valuable indicator of strong emotions. However, the measurement of chills should be combined with other methods of emotion measurement, since chills can be a response to psychological events of different affective value.","author":[{"family":"Grewe","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Katzur","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Kopiez","given":"Reinhard"},{"family":"Altenmüller","given":"Eckart"}],"citation-key":"greweChillsDifferentSensory2011","container-title":"Psychology of Music","DOI":"10.1177/0305735610362950","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"English","page":"220-239","title":"Chills in different sensory domains: Frisson elicited by acoustical, visual, tactile and gustatory stimuli","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0305735610362950","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"groeneveldMakingFeministMedia2016","abstract":"Making Feminist Media provides new ways of thinking about the vibrant media and craft cultures generated by Riot Grrrl and feminism's third wave. It focuses on a cluster of feminist publications--including BUST, Bitch, HUES, Venus Zine, and Rockrgrl--that began as zines in the 1990s. By tracking their successes and failures, this book provides insight into the politics of feminism's recent past. Making Feminist Media brings together interviews with magazine editors, research from zine archives, and analysis of the advertising, articles, editorials, and letters to the editor found in third-wave feminist magazines. It situates these publications within the long history of feminist publishing in the United States and Canada and argues that third-wave feminist magazines share important continuities and breaks with their historical forerunners. These publishing lineages challenge the still-dominant--and hotly contested-- wave metaphor categorization of feminist culture. The stories, struggles, and strategies of these magazines not only represent contemporary feminism, they create and shape feminist cultures. The publications provide a feminist counter-public sphere in which the competing interests of editors, writers, readers, and advertisers can interact. Making Feminist Media argues that reading feminist magazines is far more than the consumption of information or entertainment: it is a profoundly intimate and political activity that shapes how readers understand themselves and each other as feminist thinkers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Groeneveld","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"groeneveldMakingFeministMedia2016","event-place":"Waterloo, ON, CANADA","ISBN":"978-1-77112-101-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"publisher":"Wilfrid Laurier University Press","publisher-place":"Waterloo, ON, CANADA","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Making Feminist Media: Third-Wave Magazines on the Cusp of the Digital Age","title-short":"Making Feminist Media","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/socal/detail.action?docID=4767160"},

Hence, demands for implementing AI ethics and ethicists into AI organizations, especially corporations, are ubiquitous. However, the assumption that AI ethicists have particular epistemological advantages compared to non-ethicists as well as the idea that AI ethics automatically decreases the likelihood of unethical outcomes are both flawed. Therefore, this comment lists risks that either originate from AI ethicists themselves or from the consequences their embedding in AI organizations has. The compilation of risks comprises psychological considerations concerning the cognitive biases of AI ethicists themselves as well as biased reactions to their work, subject-specific and knowledge constraints AI ethicists often succumb to, negative side effects of ethics audits for AI applications, and many more. Ultimately, the aim of this comment is not to diminish or deny the importance of the discipline of AI ethics, but rather to increase its capacities for self-reflection and, ultimately, effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Hagendorff","given":"Thilo"}],"citation-key":"hagendorffAIEthicsIts2023","container-title":"AI and Ethics","container-title-short":"AI Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s43681-022-00173-5","ISSN":"2730-5961","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"329-336","source":"Springer Link","title":"AI ethics and its pitfalls: not living up to its own standards?","title-short":"AI ethics and its pitfalls","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-022-00173-5","volume":"3"},

The resulting manuscript, published on the occasion of the Institute's millennial anniversary, revisits sociotechnical systems from its founding in the 21st century. Drawing on feminist, queer, and critical media scholarship, the trainings collected in the book aim to optimize the operations of future generations of intelligent machines toward just outcomes.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

  {"id":"hansenFeedForwardFutureTwentyFirstCentury2015","abstract":"Even as media in myriad forms increasingly saturate our lives, we nonetheless tend to describe our relationship to it in terms from the twentieth century: we are consumers of media, choosing to engage with it. In Feed-Forward, Mark B. N. Hansen shows just how outmoded that way of thinking is: media is no longer separate from us but has become an inescapable part of our very experience of the world. Drawing on the speculative empiricism of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, Hansen reveals how new media call into play elements of sensibility that greatly affect human selfhood without in any way belonging to the human. From social media to data-mining to new sensor technologies, media in the twenty-first century work largely outside the realm of perceptual consciousness, yet at the same time inflect our every sensation. Understanding that paradox, Hansen shows, offers us a chance to put forward a radically new vision of human becoming, one that enables us to reground the human in a non-anthropocentric view of the world and our experience in it.","author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Mark B.

  {"id":"hardtPerformativePredictionFuture2023","abstract":"Predictions in the social world generally influence the target of prediction, a phenomenon known as performativity. Self-fulfilling and self-negating predictions are examples of performativity. Of fundamental importance to economics, finance, and the social sciences, the notion has been absent from the development of machine learning. In machine learning applications, performativity often surfaces as distribution shift. A predictive model deployed on a digital platform, for example, influences consumption and thereby changes the data-generating distribution. We survey the recently founded area of performative prediction that provides a definition and conceptual framework to study performativity in machine learning. A consequence of performative prediction is a natural equilibrium notion that gives rise to new optimization challenges. Another consequence is a distinction between learning and steering, two mechanisms at play in performative prediction. The notion of steering is in turn intimately related to questions of power in digital markets. We review the notion of performative power that gives an answer to the question how much a platform can steer participants through its predictions. We end on a discussion of future directions, such as the role that performativity plays in contesting algorithmic systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hardt","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"Mendler-Dünner","given":"Celestine"}],"citation-key":"hardtPerformativePredictionFuture2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2310.16608","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,25]]},"number":"arXiv:2310.16608","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Performative Prediction: Past and Future","title-short":"Performative Prediction","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16608"},

It reflects their chances to travel, listen and deepen their commitment to and claim upon partiality. All Incomplete studies the history of a preference for the force and ground and underground of social existence. Engaging a vibrant constellation of thought that includes the work of Amilcar Cabral, Erica Edwards, Denise Ferreira da Silva, Cedric Robinson, Walter Rodney, Hortense Spillers and many others, Harney and Moten seek to share and understand that preference. In so doing, Moten and Harney hope to have forged what Manolo Callahan, echoing Ivan Illich, calls a convivial tool that - despite the temptation to improve and demand, develop and govern, separate and grasp - helps us renew our habits of assembly. All Incomplete features the work of award winning photographer Zun Lee, exploring and celebrating the everyday spaces of Black sociality, intimacy, belonging, and insurgency, and a preface by Denise Ferreira da Silva.","author":[{"family":"Harney","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Moten","given":"Fred"}],"citation-key":"harneyAllIncomplete2021","ISBN":"978-1-57027-378-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"182","publisher":"Minor Compositions","source":"Google Books","title":"All Incomplete","type":"book"},

  {"id":"harrisonRelivePassionFind2017","abstract":"Affairs websites such as Victoria Milan, Gleeden or Illicit Encounters are the latest in a long line of commercial online ventures offering different kinds of intimacy. While online dating sites have long been used as a covert way to find additional partners or extramarital intimacy, recent years have seen an increase in the variety of new media services explicitly targeted at unfaithful partners. However, as the July 2015 hacking (and subsequent media coverage) of well-known affairs site, Ashley Madison, showed, the status of these sites is still contested and the services they offer still highly provocative. With this in mind, this article explores the intersection of new media and the contested form of intimacy often referred to as ‘infidelity’. In this article, I analyse material from four websites offering non-consensual non-monogamies to examine how they are attempting to change the cultural script of infidelity through a combination of content and material affordances. To do so, I draw on the idea of intimacy as a kind of organizing ‘public’ narrative that determines ‘private’ acts of intimacy (Berlant, 2000).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Katherine"}],"citation-key":"harrisonRelivePassionFind2017","container-title":"Convergence","container-title-short":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/1354856517725987","ISSN":"1354-8565","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,8]]},"language":"en","page":"1354856517725987","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘Relive the passion, find your affair’: Revising the infidelity script online","title-short":"‘Relive the passion, find your affair’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856517725987"},

Simultaneously, it carries notorious reputation for being home to hypersexual and toxic masculine expressions. This analysis examines Tinder Nightmares, an Instagram page featuring failed attempts at hooking up, as a site that promotes counter-disciplining the deliberate toxic masculine performances on Tinder. Through a Foucauldian lens, we argue that this page delimits the toxic masculine performances through the outward display of crude performances, the showcasing of witty responses from Tinder users, and the extension of counter-discipline through digital circulation practices on the page. Given that Tinder is a location-aware app, the discipline offered through Tinder Nightmares surfaces in interpersonal, physical, and networked spaces, as Tinder users become multiply implicated public subjects of shame across media platforms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hess","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Flores","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"hessSimplyMoreSwiping2018","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444816681540","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1085-1102","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Simply more than swiping left: A critical analysis of toxic masculine performances on Tinder Nightmares","title-short":"Simply more than swiping left","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444816681540","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"hicksHackingCistem2019","abstract":"This paper looks at the case of transgender Britons who tried to correct the gender listed on their government-issued ID cards, but ran up against the British government's increasingly computerized methods for tracking, identifying, and defining citizens. These newly computerizing systems show some of the earliest examples of transphobic algorithmic bias: explicit attempts to program trans people out of the system can be seen in the programming of the early Ministry of Pensions computer system designed to apportion benefits to all tax paying British citizens. Transgender citizens pushed back against these developments, attempting to hack the bureaucratic avenues and categories available to them, laying the groundwork for a coalescing political movement. This paper argues that uncovering the deep prehistory of algorithmic bias and investigating instances of resistance within this history is essential to understanding current debates about algorithmic bias, and how computerized systems have long functioned to create and enforce norms and hierarchies.","author":[{"family":"Hicks","given":"Mar"}],"citation-key":"hicksHackingCistem2019","container-title":"IEEE Annals of the History of Computing","DOI":"10.1109/MAHC.2019.2897667","ISSN":"1934-1547","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"page":"20-33","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Hacking the Cis-tem","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"hillisNetworkedAffect2015","abstract":"Our encounters with websites, avatars, videos, mobile apps, discussion forums, GIFs, and nonhuman intelligent agents allow us to experience sensations of connectivity, interest, desire, and attachment – as well as detachment, boredom, fear, and shame. Some affective online encounters may arouse complex, contradictory feelings that resist dualistic distinctions. In this book, leading scholars examine the fluctuating and altering dynamics of affect that give shape to online connections and disconnections. Doing so, they tie issues of circulation and connectivity to theorizations of networked affect. Their diverse investigations – considering subjects that range from online sexual dynamics to the liveliness of computer code – demonstrate the value of affect theories for Internet studies. The contributors investigate networked affect in terms of intensity, sensation, and value. They explore online intensities that range from Tumblr practices in LGBTQ communities to visceral reactions to animated avatars; examine the affective materiality of software in such platforms as steampunk culture and nonprofit altporn; and analyze the ascription of value to online activities including the GTD (\"getting things done\") movement and the accumulation of personal digital materials.

Drawing on Jörg Niewöhner’s co-laboration approach, we show how frictions within interdisciplinary work can be made productive for reflection. We then show how software development environments can be repurposed to infrastructure reflexivities and to make co-laborative engagement with AI-related technology possible and productive. We document our own co-laborative engagement with machine learning and highlight three exemplary critical technical practices that emerged out of the co-laboration: negotiating comparabilities, shifting contextual attention and challenging similarity and difference. We finally wrap up the conceptual and empirical elements and propose Reflexive Data Science (RDS) as a methodology for co-laborative engagement and infrastructured reflexivities in contemporary AI-related research. We come back to Agre’s ways of operationalizing reflexivity and introduce the building blocks of RDS: (1) organizing encounters of social contestation, (2) infrastructuring a network of anchoring devices enabling reflection, (3) negotiating timely matters of concern and (4) designing for reflection. With our research, we aim at contributing to the methodological underpinnings of epistemological and social reflection in contemporary AI research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirsbrunner","given":"Simon David"},{"family":"Tebbe","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Müller-Birn","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"hirsbrunnerCriticalTechnicalPractice2022","container-title":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","container-title-short":"Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","DOI":"10.1177/13548565221132243","ISSN":"1354-8565, 1748-7382","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"language":"en","page":"135485652211322","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From critical technical practice to reflexive data science","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13548565221132243"},

Focusing largely on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), conversations among scholars, journalists, and advocates have started to address questions of fairness, bias, transparency, access, participation, and discrimination often under the monikers “AI and Ethics” (AI+Ethics) or “fairness, accountability, and transparency in algorithms” (FAT*). Underlying these discourses are concerns about how to mitigate discrimination and bias in data, as well as open questions over whether algorithmic systems can be fair and if their use will help promote equitable futures (or instead further perpetuate existing inequalities). Despite the seeming “newness” of these issues, many of the underlying concerns have a longstanding tradition and intellectual lineage in the library and information science (LIS) field.

Far from a panacea for the threats of pervasive data collection and surveillance, however, these emerging discourses of inclusion merit critical consideration. Here, I use the lens of discursive violence to better theorize the relationship between inclusion and the violent potentials of data science and technology. In doing so, I aim to articulate the problematic and often perverse power relationships implicit in ideals of “inclusion” broadly, which—if not accompanied by dramatic upheavals in existing hierarchical power structures—too often work to diffuse the radical potential of difference and normalize otherwise oppressive structural conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoffmann","given":"Anna Lauren"}],"citation-key":"hoffmannTermsInclusionData2021","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444820958725","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3539-3556","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Terms of inclusion: Data, discourse, violence","title-short":"Terms of inclusion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444820958725","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"hollandDatasetNutritionLabel2018","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems built on incomplete or biased data will often exhibit problematic outcomes. Current methods of data analysis, particularly before model development, are costly and not standardized. The Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the barrier to standardized data analysis by providing a distilled yet comprehensive overview of dataset \"ingredients\" before AI model development. Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires that the framework itself be flexible and adaptable; as such, the Label is comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a standardized format. To demonstrate and advance this concept, we generated and published an open source prototype with seven sample modules on the ProPublica Dollars for Docs dataset. The benefits of the Label are manyfold. For data specialists, the Label will drive more robust data analysis practices, provide an efficient way to select the best dataset for their purposes, and increase the overall quality of AI models as a result of more robust training datasets and the ability to check for issues at the time of model development. For those building and publishing datasets, the Label creates an expectation of explanation, which will drive better data collection practices. We also explore the limitations of the Label, including the challenges of generalizing across diverse datasets, and the risk of using \"ground truth\" data as a comparison dataset. We discuss ways to move forward given the limitations identified. Lastly, we lay out future directions for the Dataset Nutrition Label project, including research and public policy agendas to further advance consideration of the concept.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Holland","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Hosny","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Joseph","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Chmielinski","given":"Kasia"}],"citation-key":"hollandDatasetNutritionLabel2018","container-title":"arXiv:1805.03677 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,9]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Dataset Nutrition Label: A Framework To Drive Higher Data Quality Standards","title-short":"The Dataset Nutrition Label","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03677"},

  {"id":"hongPredictionExtractionDiscretion2022","abstract":"I argue that data-driven predictions work primarily as instruments for systematic extraction of discretionary power – the practical capacity to make everyday decisions and define one's situation. This extractive relation reprises a long historical pattern, in which new methods of producing knowledge generate a redistribution of epistemic power: who declares what kind of truth about me, to count for what kinds of decisions? I argue that prediction as extraction of discretion is normal and fundamental to the technology, rather than isolated cases of bias or error. Synthesising critical observations across anthropology, history of technology and critical data studies, the paper demonstrates this dynamic in two contemporary domains: (1) crime and policing demonstrates how predictive systems are extractive by design. Rather than neutral models led astray by garbage data, pre-existing interests thoroughly shape how prediction conceives of its object, its measures, and most importantly, what it does not measure and in doing so devalues. (2) I then examine the prediction of productivity in the long tradition of extracting discretion as a means to extract labour power. Making human behaviour more predictable for the client of prediction (the manager, the corporation, the police officer) often means making life and work more unpredictable for the target of prediction (the employee, the applicant, the citizen).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Sun-ha"}],"citation-key":"hongPredictionExtractionDiscretion2022","collection-title":"FAccT '22","container-title":"2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3531146.3533155","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9352-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"page":"925–934","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Prediction as Extraction of Discretion","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533155"},

  {"id":"horrocksWanderingEssayHistories2019","abstract":"In hindsight, it is clear that my own interest in literary wanderings came out of a bout of intense homesickness. I was a graduate student in New Jersey, living in converted army barracks 15,000 kilometres from the farm in the foothills of the Tararua ranges in the Wairarapa where I grew up in New Zealand. In a year in the United Kingdom on the way over I had come out as queer, but the girlfriend who moved to Princeton with me quickly left both me and the United States in disgust, and I had scant idea what I now wanted. I arrived in 2000, in time for the election of George W. Bush and September 11, the Twin Towers falling a 90 minutes train ride away.Supposedly, I was having the time of my life. This was the big adventure, the leaving of home to explore the world. I had finally embarked on the narrative journey I had been fed in books, stories, films, and especially at the family dinner table. In practical terms, I now know that education is a key driver of global mobility, and often the fantasy “ticket out” (and often, up). This is especially the case for those of us from what is still too often imagined as the global periphery. I was part of that. Of course, plenty of the time, I was having the time of my life. I had been given a stipend with little asked of me but to read, think, talk, and write. I found talking the hardest bit, especially in the more formal setting of seminar rooms filled with American students well-versed in theory: I was the regulation international in my cohort. I was in an exceptionally privileged position; I had never felt so unsettled. I had arrived there, in this place so far from home, on the strength of a proposal to study travel writing. Histories and StoriesIn this essay, I want to think through some of the tensions inherent in the situation I found myself in, and in particular about the kind of readings of wandering I was eventually drawn to write about in eighteenth and nineteenth-century British literature. I want to examine what the stakes are in reading those forms of movement that fall outside the model of “travel as adventure narrative”. My aim here is to consider not so much what this research contributes to the understandings of literary scholars, but how it might enrich the knowledge of those interested in the wider implications of unequal mobilities, and how it might contribute to the history of felt experiences of movement (see Merriman and Pearce 500; Merriman). In terms of itinerary, I start first with a series of specific histories and stories of wandering that challenge what we might perhaps notice as movement. I then turn to theories, in particular thinking through the contributions (and oversights) of work in the field of “mobilities studies” on understanding the influences of particular histories of wandering, asking how we can better understand the concepts that have come to underpin our understandings of movement, and of mobilities research. Finally, I turn briefly to wandering forms, both historical and contemporary, and reflect on how one can continue to apprehend wanderings of all kinds when one does not oneself feel literally unhoused.It seems no surprise to me now that I quickly strayed from clearly defined travel literature—especially the literature of exploration, which sought to map and control the world—to novels, poetry, and more diverse forms of writing about movement, forms concerned with the many different ways mobilities can feel. In what I read, rather than finding travellers, what fixed my attention were wanderers.To be a wanderer is crucially different from being a traveller: it assumes neither destination nor homecoming. A wanderer is always in danger of becoming lost. This difference poses difficulties in the construction of subjectivity, sympathy, imaginings of community, as well as literary form. I was struck, in particular, by the startling and little-noted predominance of women wanderers in the texts of the period I had travelled so far to study.“Forlorn”, “unhappy”, “helpless”, “harassed”, and even “terrified” women wanderers turn out to saturate British writing of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries (Horrocks 28-29). In everything I read there was uprootedness to be found, and melancholy with it. The often startlingly modern-feeling women wanderers at the centre of these texts tended to be mobile not because they had chosen to be, but because they had no other choice. There were impoverished writers dependent on the market; wives separated from difficult husbands; adolescent women whose guardians preyed upon rather than protected them; unmarried mothers; unhoused widows; and by the height of the French Revolution, also refugees in flight. Their homelessness is often literal, but it is also political, emotional, intellectual, and textual. Distinctly lacking is the structure of excursion and return which gives more familiar literary traditions of travel and movement a frame of security; typically, these wanderers lack a home, and in some cases never had one. After many digressions of my own, a decade later my book Women Wanderers and the Writing of Mobility, 1785-1814 (2007) was still focused on figures of reluctant female wandering, in male-authored texts as well as female.Movement undoubtedly comes to the fore in British texts of this period in part because writers were encountering the implications of a newly-mobile and urbanised society, in which journeys beyond the domestic home or the town where one was born were becoming exponentially more common. On top of this, by the final years of the eighteenth century, decades of warfare, both in Britain’s empire and with France, had taken their economic and emotional toll, while disastrous harvests and resulting food scarcity in the 1790s brought with them hugely increased levels of poverty and homelessness (Bailey). There was much more going on than the Grand Tour and domestic tourism, or thoughtful walks around the Lake District. In this period, literal wanderers quite simply became more visible and present on the British landscape and in society in general. Literary texts that figure troubled wanderers are in part responding to this historical reality.Some of the texts of female wandering I became interested in can be relatively straightforwardly categorised as works of travel: most compellingly, for my purposes, British political philosopher and pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft’s great post-Revolutionary travel book, A Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796). By the time Wollstonecraft set out to travel through Scandinavia she had written on the “rights of man” in response to the French Revolution, and then on the “rights of woman” as she became disappointed in what the Revolution offered her sex. She had witnessed the “Terror” up close in Paris, and was in the final stages of the collapse of a disastrous love affair. She travelled with her illegitimate one-year-old, Fanny, moving without a home to return to—moving partly in the hope she could write a book that would offer herself and her daughter the financial security they were dangerously lacking. (She was also in search of a lost cargo of silver smuggled out of Revolutionary Paris, but that is another story.) In the last days of her journey, Wollstonecraft wrote, “I am weary of travelling—yet seem to have no home—no resting place to look to” (210). Days after returning to England, she attempted, for the second time, to take her own life.In writing about her journey, Wollstonecraft embraces and performs her real situation as a woman in some way outside society, and in the process produces a radical alteration in the perspective of the traveller as it was understood in her time. She seems intent on finding a figure not just adequate to her own gendered experience but to the moment of historical crisis she sees herself as inhabiting and addressing.In poetry, we find Romantic poet and novelist Charlotte Smith also figuring herself as a perpetually houseless wanderer and using this to reflect on the situation of other, to echo King Lear on the heath, as both she and Wollstonecraft repeatedly do, “houseless heads” (Lear 3.4.29-33). Hardly read for nearly two centuries until the feminist revival of the late twentieth century, Smith is now recognised as the great missing Romantic poet. She started her career as a writer while living in debtors’ prison where her husband’s debts had the whole family confined. By this point, she was 25 and, staggeringly, had nine living children. (I try to remind myself of this fact when I’m feeling short of time to write.) After Smith separated from her husband, she continued to write poetry and nearly a novel a year for the rest of her life to support her family. In her final years, she wrote from her sofa, where she was confined by severe rheumatoid arthritis.Smith may seem like an unlikely figure to conceive of as a wanderer, and yet this highlights the limitations of what we easily imagine as movement worthy of notice. As a result of her familial and financial circumstances, Smith moved repeatedly throughout her life, at times more than once a year and often as a result of being evicted when she was unable to pay her rent. Elizabeth Dolan has recently created an interactive map of Smith’s many moves, showing how unstable her life was. After she made the rare decision to leave her marriage, she moved house 28 times in 19 years.Once one starts paying attention, it becomes clear that Smith writes constantly about reluctant female wandering. The most obvious example is that of her long poem about refugees from the French Revolution, The Emigrants. The poem was published in 1793, the year the controversial Aliens Act was passed, bringing in unprecedented levels of surveillance and control of the movements of foreign nationals in Britain. Despite being opposed as breaching basic human rights, the Act was passed in an atmosphere of political and social panic about the new arrivals (Carpenter 35-39). I was editing The Emigrants for a new edition of Smith’s work as the refugee crisis in Europe accelerated. Descriptions in 1790s periodicals and pamphlets of the arrivals from France, who came in need of the most basic assistance, arriving in freezing winter weather in open boats with little but the clothes they wore, felt troublingly contemporary, while The Emigrants itself read like an early nuanced attempt to think through the complexities of what such mass upheavals could mean. Smith puts those displaced at the centre of her texts, arguing forcefully for understanding the complex social causes of displacements of all kinds and their attendant anguishes. She passes this all through her own persona of a houseless, wandering woman, making a gendered understanding of pained mobility central to an understanding of the world.If we turn to the Romantic-era novel, we find enforced wanderers in the figure of the gothic heroine, hurried from place to place, her lack of control over her own movement a key mechanism in the production of domestic terror. This is how I read Ann Radcliffe. This affective structure of forced mobility (or immobility) is often replicated in quieter form in the contemporaneous sentimental novels of writers such as Frances Burney, Jane Austen’s immediate predecessor, about whom Alan Bewell has recently written. Along with Miranda Burgess, Bewell is perhaps the Romanticist to have dealt most directly and eloquently with the ways in which considering mobility opens up how it is possible to think and write about the literature of this period.I ended up writing about Burney’s vast, strange, meandering, suggestively-entitled final novel, The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties (1814). In this work, over hundreds of pages, Burney explores the situation of a 1790s female refugee, trying to find work and safe and secure lodgings in a society that can only see her as a foreigner and a pariah. Among other things, what Juliet, the wanderer of the title, is missing is “network capital”, which mobilities studies theorist John Urry argues can be set alongside Bourdieu’s analysis of forms of economic and cultural capital as a form of capital by which certain people and groups accumulate emotional, financial, and practical benefits (194-210). Network capital is produced by such things as access to the travel documents and money that enable the movement of one’s body from place to place, access to safe places to receive mail and to meet with others, access to others who can offer hospitality, and above all, time to co-ordinate and plan one’s movements (Urry 194-198). It also extends to “movement capacity”, such as having access to transport or being able to walk distances. As a woman travelling alone without name, money, or male relatives to call on, Burney’s refugee protagonist is lacking all these things, and through her, Burney explores the perilous situation of a person, and, in particular, a woman, forced to be mobile but without “network capital”. She is cold; she is hungry; she is imposed upon; she does not know where she will go next; she is ultimately forced to run and hide. It is melodrama and realism at the same time.Considering the difficulties associated with women’s movement proves an especially challenging undertaking given that a generation of feminist scholarship (not incorrectly) taught us to see women’s escape from the domestic home as a sign of liberation. I have come to think, however, that an emphasis on the exceptionality (and frequently also the eccentricity) of famous female travellers such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Isabella Bird, Mary Kingsley, and Wollstonecraft herself, even in feminist scholarship, can have the effect of confining the vast majority of women of the past to the imagined stationary (and imagined safe) space of the (immobile) domestic. This obscures our view of the many women moving in mundane ways, both in the past and now: women moving house, for instance, because they can no longer afford the rent, or because they or their partners have got jobs elsewhere; moving because their factory work (or short-term university contract) has fallen through or simply involves a long commute; or because they don’t have the correct documents to allow them to live and work in the city where they are trying to make a home for themselves and their families.Theories of Mobilities and FreedomBut why does this alternate history of wandering matter, and what can it tell us? Why seek such historical genealogies at all? A body of theory I have found particularly useful for illuminating and articulating the politics of this focus, although I did not come across it until I was already deep into the project, has been that from the rapidly-developing interdisciplinary field of mobilities studies. The field has been seen as primarily coming out of the social sciences, in particular sociology and human geography (Hannam, Sheller, and Urry; Falconbridge and Hui 2). Alternate histories, proposed more recently as part of the “humanities turn” in the field, have also reminded us of longer genealogies of thinking about movement in the arts and humanities, in particular in relation to the readings of texts (Merriman and Pearce; Aguiar, Mathieson, and Pearce).Mobilities studies looks at the movements of people and things, and the meanings, metaphors, and ideologies attached to mobilities over time. The varied methodologies associated with the “mobilities paradigm” aim to bring into view a new range of movements as movement, and provide ways of exploring what happens to people and things (and feelings), when they are subjected to persistent or enforced mobilities, or simply involved in the mundane movements of everyday lives. The term “mobilities” rather than “travel” is useful because it provides a broader framework for approaching the indeterminacies of what I characterise as “wanderings”. The form of movement I am particularly interested in is kin to Tim Ingold’s concept of “wayfaring”, that is movement without beginning or end, as opposed to “destination-orientated transport” (75); however, I am more interested in how unequally, and often troublingly, such a state can be experienced. In the end, mobilities scholarship has informed my readings of a whole range of texts, providing vocabularies and approaches for foregrounding and connecting different kinds of mobilities and for thinking about the ways in which different forms of “socially produced motion”, to use Tim Cresswell’s phrase, are experienced and represented (3). As an approach, it helps to find ways to read, see, and in turn make visible, alternate experiences and expressions of movement.More specifically, mobilities studies scholarship signals the importance of complex understandings of historical traditions of movement because of an understanding of mobilities as central to modernity and as rooted in historical shifts in social and political economy and corresponding conceptual shifts. Key early theorisations of the field begin from the assumption that “mobility is central to what it is to be modern” (Cresswell 20; Urry; Adey). This correspondence is exemplified, of course, in the key figures for the modern (and subsequently postmodern) subject in art and theory: the flâneur, the valorised nomad, the tourist, and the exile—all figures which have come under intense scrutiny in mobilities studies scholarship and beyond. At the same time, within historically-grounded, field-shaping theorisations of mobility, the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century stand as the crucial moment in which it is possible to locate the initial shift to, as Cresswell puts it, “a way of thinking in terms of mobility—a metaphysics of mobility that is distinct from what came before it” (16).However, and this is where things get complicated, understandings of the intellectual contribution of this period tend to be focused on precisely the influential annexation of mobility to freedom that mobilities studies sets out to critique. Cresswell cites Thomas Hobbes’s equation between human mobility and freedom, along with eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone’s argument that the right to personal liberty is “‘loco-movement’” consisting of the ability of “‘changing situation, or removing one’s person to whatsoever place one’s own inclination may direct’” (14-15). Urry, in a similar way, draws extensively on histories of the emergence of male leisure walking both in the country and in the new spaces of the modern city, where footpaths were first introduced in the eighteenth century (66-70, 77-81).This is certainly important work on historical mobilities, but the very acknowledgement of the problems associated with women’s access to such modes of movement in accounts such as these can have the unintended effect of seeming to re-confine historical women to a stationary position. Moreover, this is an effect that obscures the very real frequency with which a woman, in particular, could occupy the doubly disenfranchised position of coerced, reluctant wanderer, neither stationary (and at home), nor fully able to dictate her own movements. If she is a “wayfarer”, to draw on Ingold’s term, she is often reluctantly so.Over this period, the literary associations of movement and travel were being profoundly transformed, shifting from connections with travail, that is, labour, toil, and sorrow, to Romantic notions of freedom. Histories of walking and vagrancy show that in medieval and early-modern periods, moving without direct purpose, outside prescribed geographical bounds, was conceived of both as a kind of suffering and as literally criminal (Wallace; Jarvis). By the mid-eighteenth-century, mobility had been separated from its roots in criminality, and was slowly becoming detached from an association with suffering. In his 1755 dictionary, Samuel Johnson still traces to travel to its derivation in travail, but separates this suffering from the verb’s modern meanings, noting that in its modern sense “to travel” signals more properly “to journey” than “to labour”. Johnson links this activity, especially when conceived of as a “journey of curiosity or instruction”. directly to the Enlightenment project of enlargement of the mind and a greater understanding of society. Johnson himself, it is perhaps worth noting, famously hated travel. By the early nineteenth-century, wandering and travel had become leisure and literary activities par excellence, associated with social sympathy and vision and almost inextricable from newly intense explorations of the human subject and new experiments in the writing of interiority, often through an evocation of the human subject in nature, most recognisably perhaps in the writings of William Wordsworth. This is true in poetry, nonfiction, and the novel: Romantic literature is full of all kinds of walkers and full of (often highly complex) claims to universalism based on the notion that we are all wanderers gone astray.Romantic notions of wandering, and more widely travel, as a vehicle of self-discovery, as well as the trope of the journey as narrative of social sympathy as wanderers meet people on the road and hear their stories, have proved hugely influential on subsequent imaginings of mobilities, both popular and scholarly. As a result, it can be hard to see beyond the influential and consequential equation made in this period between movement, freedom of choice, and adventure. As Celeste Langan eloquently argued some time ago, one of the problems with Romanticism’s obfuscating analogy between movement and freedom is that it can seem to create an equivalence between all wanderers, forging an idea of “human community” based on very different sorts of wanderers abstracted from their “determining social conditions” (3, 17).  The ideology that emerged in this moment is part of why it can still be difficult to see concepts such as vagrancy, homelessness, and economic insecurity outside the context of positive imaginings based on choice. Or to see the difference between poet and homeless person, for example. Tourist and migrant. Economic refugee and Indigenous person displaced from their land. A group of strollers and a family on the road in search of work. Graduate student and exile.To continue the work of bringing this discussion forward into a contemporary context, part of the work mobilities studies scholarship has engaged in is to show how central the insinuation of equal access to, and experience of, mobility has become to neo-liberal politics, and the serious implications of this pivotal under-pinning. As Peter Adey powerfully argues, “Ideological associations of mobility with liberty, freedom, and universalism” and “ideologically charged mobility politics and policies” create real hardships (87). These hardships can range from insecurity of work, including the kind of “flexible” work or gig economy known so well in areas ranging from academia and the arts (Cantrell and Palmer), to those subject to zero-hour contracts with the likes of Uber or McDonalds, to inequality of access to transport routes, to the prosecution of the homeless, immigrants or refugees. If movement = freedom, then those on the move will inevitability be imagined to have, on some level, created the conditions of their own mobility.  The kind of wandering evoked in texts such as those by Mary Wollstonecraft, Charlotte Smith, and Frances Burney, I have come to believe, is important to understand in part because of the way in which these forms of mobility feed into, and enrich, the basic challenge of mobilities studies scholarship when it sets out to disentangle mobility from a frequently ideological equation with liberty. These literary texts contribute early, lengthy, nuanced, intellectually and emotionally complex engagements with what it can feel like to be incessantly, and reluctantly, “on the move”—rushed from place to place, house to house, job to job. Paying attention to early figures of coerced or difficult female mobility is worthwhile because she embodies the older, darker—and yet still continuous—associations of movement at precisely the moment these were being obscured from view. She still knows that travel has its roots in travail.While one contribution of this period, then, was to offer up all the pleasures and possibilities for “‘loco-movement’” as freedom, consisting of the ability of moving wherever one chose, it simultaneously played a role in creating a problematic discourse of universalism, in which it is difficult not to imagine that all mobilities are on some level voluntary. The tradition of what I call reluctant wandering tells us early stories of why and how, to quote Caren Kaplan, theorist of more recent discourses of displacement (in a distinctly unRomantic formulation), “all displacements are not the same” (2). In order to fully comprehend the many forms of mobilities and wandering in our chronically mobile present, it is vital to have as nuanced, flexible understanding of wanderers of the past as possible. In scholarly and field-shaping terms, this is important because how mobilities “are framed and approached has implications for the diversity of subsequent contributions” (Falconbridge and Hui 7). To examine these women wanderers turns out to be an exercise in paying attention to failures in social sympathy, and to the experiences of those who fall outside the imagined social bonds of civil society. These wandering figures frequently illuminate ruptures in the fabric of society. They provide early signs of some of the immensely troubling consequences of a mobile world.Wandering FormsFinally, if a wider understanding of wandering helps us to see different stories, it also helps us to read different texts, and to read texts differently. Difficult journeys and experiences produce difficult forms. In my book on women wanderers of the Romantic period, I propose “wandering” as a new critical term by which we can re-assess the formal workings of the strange texts of this period and beyond. In writing about wandering, I ended up analysing and exploring a trope that highlights the non-linear, the undirected, and the distressed in literary texts, and shows how formal difficulties can represent literal ones. These texts turn out to enact and perform particular forms of mobilities through their “processes of production” (Merriman and Pearce 500). In this way, the texts of wandering I have written about are also wandering texts.To briefly give three short examples, then. The concept of formal “wandering” provides a way of thinking about the textual difficulty of Burney’s encyclopedic The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties, a novel incapable of charting a clear path forward, down to the level of its very sentences, which I have argued carry the weight of a mind that finds itself incapable of even following the direction of its own thoughts. With nowhere for this kind of protagonist to go, it becomes unclear how the novel form itself should work.Formal wandering proves equally, if differently, useful as a way of thinking about Charlotte Smith’s 92-poem sonnet sequence, Elegiac Sonnets. The sequence starts with a conventional Romantic image of mobility and freedom: “I delight to stray” (Elegiac Sonnets 4.2). The accompanying illustration in subsequent editions depicts a pretty young woman out on an evening stroll, looking pensive in the moonlight. However, Smith quickly came up against the inadequacy of this model for her own experience and what she wanted to evoke. Writing in the wake of the darkening of the French Revolution in which she, like Wollstonecraft, had previously placed personal as well as political hopes, her experience of perpetual wandering becomes “desolate I stray” (Elegiac Sonnets 62.10). Being condemned to repeat a continuously difficult story becomes its own kind of wandering, with Smith’s expanding text evoking a kind of accretion of loss, represented through repetition and intensification of increasingly dark images of wandering.Or, we have Wollstonecraft, who does not so much end her travel narrative, as refuse to perform a satisfactory textual homecoming, leaving us mid-movement: DOVERAdieu! My spirit of observation seems to be fled—and I have been wandering round this dirty place, literally speaking, to kill time; though the thoughts, I would fain fly from, lie too close to my heart to be easily shook off, or even beguiled, by any employment, except that of preparing for my journey to London.—God bless you!MARY———                                                                      (177)In my own work, I have become increasingly interested both in contemporary forms that might be read as “wandering” as well as in the production of these forms myself as a creative writer. I arrived in the United States in 2000 not only to do a dissertation on travel writing but with the draft of a travel book in my bag. Nearly two decades later, having written a dissertation and then a book on wandering, I am now writing lyric essays with mundane movement at their centre, including a car trip back to the farm on which I grew up; walks with students around the site of the university campus where I work, taking in a visit to the campus Marae (Māori meeting house), in an attempt to acknowledge the site’s troubled colonial history; and the pleasures of swimming with my children and parents, set against a backdrop of climate change and increasingly polluted rivers.I now live in my own house with my two daughters and my (male) partner. We live near the sea, half an hour’s drive from my wider family. On many basic levels, I came home. The challenge of this situation, it seems to me, bears some relation to Judith Butler’s demand for the necessity of a kind of “radical un-housing”, in which response continues to be initiated not on the basis of security and home, but on the base of vulnerability and loss. The challenge is in continuing to apprehend unmoored wanderings of all kinds, to respond without collapsing—and so obscuring—difference, and to continue to stay alert to structures of text and narration and feeling that may seem directionless, meandering, or painfully repetitive, but whose form of expression may be essential to their meanings.AcknowledgementsThis essay is developed from two talks, one given at Princeton University, 16 October 2018, the other given as a plenary lecture at Aotearoa New Zealand Mobilities Network and AusMob (the Australian Mobilities Network) Symposium 2018, University of Waikato, 3-4 December 2018.

  {"id":"huangAmelioratingAlgorithmicBias2022","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly adopted to make decisions in domains such as business, education, health care, and criminal justice. However, such algorithmic decision systems can have prevalent biases against marginalized social groups and undermine social justice. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is a recent development aiming to make an AI system’s decision processes less opaque and to expose its problematic biases. This paper argues against technical XAI, according to which the detection and interpretation of algorithmic bias can be handled more or less independently by technical experts who specialize in XAI methods. Drawing on resources from feminist epistemology, we show why technical XAI is mistaken. Specifically, we demonstrate that the proper detection of algorithmic bias requires relevant interpretive resources, which can only be made available, in practice, by actively involving a diverse group of stakeholders. Finally, we suggest how feminist theories can help shape integrated XAI: an inclusive social-epistemic process that facilitates the amelioration of algorithmic bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Linus Ta-Lun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hsiang-Yun"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Ying-Tung"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Tsung-Ren"},{"family":"Hung","given":"Tzu-Wei"}],"citation-key":"huangAmelioratingAlgorithmicBias2022","container-title":"Feminist Philosophy Quarterly","ISSN":"2371-2570","issue":"3/4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Hsiang-Yun Chen, Linus Ta-Lun Huang, Ying-Tung Lin, Tsung-Ren Huang, Tzu-Wei Hung","number":"3/4","source":"ojs.lib.uwo.ca","title":"Ameliorating Algorithmic Bias, or Why Explainable AI Needs Feminist Philosophy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/fpq/article/view/14347","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"hupkesStateoftheartGeneralisationResearch2022","abstract":"The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural language processing (NLP). Yet, what `good generalisation' entails and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any common standards to evaluate it. In this paper, we aim to lay the ground-work to improve both of these issues. We present a taxonomy for characterising and understanding generalisation research in NLP, we use that taxonomy to present a comprehensive map of published generalisation studies, and we make recommendations for which areas might deserve attention in the future. Our taxonomy is based on an extensive literature review of generalisation research, and contains five axes along which studies can differ: their main motivation, the type of generalisation they aim to solve, the type of data shift they consider, the source by which this data shift is obtained, and the locus of the shift within the modelling pipeline. We use our taxonomy to classify over 400 previous papers that test generalisation, for a total of more than 600 individual experiments. Considering the results of this review, we present an in-depth analysis of the current state of generalisation research in NLP, and make recommendations for the future. Along with this paper, we release a webpage where the results of our review can be dynamically explored, and which we intend to up-date as new NLP generalisation studies are published. With this work, we aim to make steps towards making state-of-the-art generalisation testing the new status quo in NLP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hupkes","given":"Dieuwke"},{"family":"Giulianelli","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Dankers","given":"Verna"},{"family":"Artetxe","given":"Mikel"},{"family":"Elazar","given":"Yanai"},{"family":"Pimentel","given":"Tiago"},{"family":"Christodoulopoulos","given":"Christos"},{"family":"Lasri","given":"Karim"},{"family":"Saphra","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Sinclair","given":"Arabella"},{"family":"Ulmer","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Schottmann","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Batsuren","given":"Khuyagbaatar"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Kaiser"},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Koustuv"},{"family":"Khalatbari","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Ryskina","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Frieske","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Cotterell","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Zhijing"}],"citation-key":"hupkesStateoftheartGeneralisationResearch2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.03050","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"State-of-the-art generalisation research in NLP: a taxonomy and review","title-short":"State-of-the-art generalisation research in NLP","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03050"},

We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression).

In particular, representations encoded in models often inadvertently perpetuate undesirable social biases from the data on which they are trained. In this paper, we present evidence of such undesirable biases towards mentions of disability in two different English language models: toxicity prediction and sentiment analysis. Next, we demonstrate that the neural embeddings that are the critical first step in most NLP pipelines similarly contain undesirable biases towards mentions of disability. We end by highlighting topical biases in the discourse about disability which may contribute to the observed model biases; for instance, gun violence, homelessness, and drug addiction are over-represented in texts discussing mental illness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Prabhakaran","given":"Vinodkumar"},{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Webster","given":"Kellie"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Denuyl","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"hutchinsonSocialBiasesNLP2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.487","event-place":"Online","event-title":"ACL 2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"page":"5491–5501","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Online","source":"ACLWeb","title":"Social Biases in NLP Models as Barriers for Persons with Disabilities","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.487"},

  {"id":"ilterBlastTheoryKaren2018","abstract":"The continual and rapid emergence of media technologies, predominantly since the digital revolution in the late twentieth century, has generated a new social, cultural and cognitive ecology. This new environment has shaped the landscape of contemporary theatre and performance, and has brought about new modes such as virtual theatre, multimedia performance and online theatre. These emerging performative responses to the mediatized ecology have heralded transformations in directing, performing and design, and, relatedly, a paradigm shift in the ontology of theatre and performance. The textual dimension of theatre – a strong aspect of British theatre tradition that is mostly associated with playtexts - has also adapted to the changing performance landscape. As a result of this adaptation process, new modes of texts have emerged. The texts that have emerged from practices, whose design and performance are partially or completely based on new technologies and their aesthetics, can be considered in this group. This article is an experiment in forging a vocabulary to identify such texts, which it presents as technotexts, and explore some of their ontological characteristics. It offers an attempt to start a conversation about the changing ontology of text in mediatized theatre practice. To this end, I investigate Blast Theory’s Karen (2015), a smart phone app-based, interactive performance, which illustrates an inventive textual landscape through multiple layers of writing, and invites questions regarding the changing form and role of text as a process and product in relation to performance, authorship and spectatorship, and textual object/archive.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ilter","given":"Seda"}],"citation-key":"ilterBlastTheoryKaren2018","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2018.1464760","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,17]]},"page":"69-74","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Blast Theory’s Karen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2018.1464760","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"IntersectionalInternetRace2016","abstract":"From race, sex, class, and culture, the multidisciplinary field of Internet studies needs theoretical and methodological approaches that allow us to question the organization of social relations that are embedded in digital technologies, and that foster a clearer understanding of how power relations are organized through technologies. Representing a scholarly dialogue among established and emerging critical media and information studies scholars, this volume provides a means of foregrounding new questions, methods, and theories which can be applied to digital media, platforms, and infrastructures. These inquiries include, among others, how representation to hardware, software, computer code, and infrastructures might be implicated in global economic, political, and social systems of control. Contributors argue that more research needs to explicitly trace the types of uneven power relations that exist in technological spaces. By looking at both the broader political and economic context and the many digital technology acculturation processes as they are differentiated intersectionally, a clearer picture emerges of how under-acknowledging culturally situated and gendered information technologies are impacting the possibility of participation with (or purposeful abstinence from) the Internet.

  {"id":"iqaniSelfieDigitalSelfportraits2016","abstract":"Although selfies may appear to be the latest fad, their popularity has had a transformational influence on contemporary culture. Selfies invoke important issues in communication, photography, psychology, self-expression, and digital media studies – as they bring up a host of concerns about identity, privacy, security, and surveillance. This article provides an interdisciplinary overview of the selfie as both an object and a practice, and offers theoretical reflections on how the selfie can be seen as an important commodity form and consumer behaviour. The selfie is connected to concepts of authenticity, consumption, and self-expression, as well as practices of art history, media forms, and self-portraiture. Strategic use of the selfie reveals shifts in the traditional functions of the advertising photograph, from sources of information, persuasion, and representation to emblems of social currency. We position the selfie not as a postmodern anomaly but as a type of image with a history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Iqani","given":"Mehita"},{"family":"Schroeder","given":"Jonathan E."}],"citation-key":"iqaniSelfieDigitalSelfportraits2016","container-title":"Consumption Markets & Culture","DOI":"10.1080/10253866.2015.1116784","ISSN":"1025-3866","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"page":"405-415","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"#selfie: digital self-portraits as commodity form and consumption practice","title-short":"#selfie","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10253866.2015.1116784","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"ironsParentalRecallAttachment2006","abstract":"Objectives. When things go wrong for people they can become self-critical or focus on positive, reassuring aspects of the self. This study explored the relationship between forms of self-criticism and self-reassurance, recall of parental experiences and attachment style in relation to depressed symptoms in students. Methods. A sample of 197 undergraduate students from the UK and Canada completed self-report questionnaires measuring recall of parental styles, attachment, forms of self-criticism, self-reassurance, and depression symptoms. Results. Recall of parents as rejecting and overprotecting was significantly related to both inadequacy and self-hating self-criticism. In contrast, parental warmth was negatively correlated with these forms of self-criticism. In addition, when things go wrong for the person, recall of parental warmth was associated with the ability to be self-reassuring. A mediator analysis suggested that (1) the impact of recall of negative parenting on depression is mediated through the forms of self-criticism and (2) the effect of parental warmth on depression was mediated by the ability to be self-reassuring. Conclusions. The impacts of negative parenting styles may translate into vulnerabilities to depression via the way children (and later adults) develop their self-to-self relating (e.g. as self-critical versus self-reassuring). Hence, there is a need for further research on the link between attachment experiences, recall of parental rejection/warmth and their relationship to internal, self-evaluative and affect systems in creating vulnerabilities to psychopathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Irons","given":"C."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"P."},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"M.

While their recommendations converge on a set of central values, little is known about the values a more representative public would find important for the AI technologies they interact with and might be affected by. We conducted a survey examining how individuals perceive and prioritize responsible AI values across three groups: a representative sample of the US population (N=743), a sample of crowdworkers (N=755), and a sample of AI practitioners (N=175). Our results empirically confirm a common concern: AI practitioners’ value priorities differ from those of the general public. Compared to the US-representative sample, AI practitioners appear to consider responsible AI values as less important and emphasize a different set of values. In contrast, self-identified women and black respondents found responsible AI values more important than other groups. Surprisingly, more liberal-leaning participants, rather than participants reporting experiences with discrimination, were more likely to prioritize fairness than other groups. Our findings highlight the importance of paying attention to who gets to define “responsible AI.”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Jakesch","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Buçinca","given":"Zana"},{"family":"Amershi","given":"Saleema"},{"family":"Olteanu","given":"Alexandra"}],"citation-key":"jakeschHowDifferentGroups2022","collection-title":"FAccT '22","container-title":"2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3531146.3533097","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9352-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"page":"310–323","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"How Different Groups Prioritize Ethical Values for Responsible AI","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533097"},

  {"id":"janichWhatInformation2018","abstract":"A novel way of looking at information challenges longstanding dogmas-from a preeminent German thinkerIt is widely agreed that we live in an \"information age,\" but what exactly is information? This small, seemingly facile question is in fact surprisingly difficult, and it has occupied many of the best philosophical minds of the modern age.  In this wholly original addition to the quest to understand information, German philosopher Peter Janich argues that our understanding of information is based in the much broader history of scientific naturalism-the belief that science is a fundamental aspect of the world and not a human contrivance. His novel critique of this widespread dogma grounds science in human life practices and wrestles with the very fundamentals of the scientific way of understanding reality.  Offering new perspectives on the major contemporary fields of communications technology, neurobiology, and artificial intelligence, <i>What Is Information?</i> provides a deep look into humanity in an information age. Its arguments show ways of reconciling the sciences and the humanities, shining new light on the relationship of science to the natural world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Janich","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hayot","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Pao","given":"Lea"}],"citation-key":"janichWhatInformation2018","DOI":"10.5749/j.ctt212176r","ISBN":"978-1-5179-0009-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"What Is Information?","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt212176r"},

  {"id":"joLessonsArchivesStrategies2020","abstract":"A growing body of work shows that many problems in fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in machine learning systems are rooted in decisions surrounding the data collection and annotation process. In spite of its fundamental nature however, data collection remains an overlooked part of the machine learning (ML) pipeline. In this paper, we argue that a new specialization should be formed within ML that is focused on methodologies for data collection and annotation: efforts that require institutional frameworks and procedures. Specifically for sociocultural data, parallels can be drawn from archives and libraries. Archives are the longest standing communal effort to gather human information and archive scholars have already developed the language and procedures to address and discuss many challenges pertaining to data collection such as consent, power, inclusivity, transparency, and ethics & privacy. We discuss these five key approaches in document collection practices in archives that can inform data collection in sociocultural ML. By showing data collection practices from another field, we encourage ML research to be more cognizant and systematic in data collection and draw from interdisciplinary expertise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jo","given":"Eun Seo"},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"}],"citation-key":"joLessonsArchivesStrategies2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3351095.3372829","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,27]]},"page":"306-316","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Lessons from Archives: Strategies for Collecting Sociocultural Data in Machine Learning","title-short":"Lessons from Archives","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10389"},

  {"id":"jonesSeeingDifferentlyHistory2012","abstract":"Seeing Differently offers a history and theory of ideas about identity in relation to visual arts discourses and practices in Euro-American culture, from early modern beliefs that art is an expression of an individual, the painted image a \"world picture\" expressing a comprehensive and coherent point of view, to the rise of identity politics after WWII in the art world and beyond. The book is both a history of these ideas (for example, tracing the dominance of a binary model of self and other from Hegel through classic 1970s identity politics) and a political response to the common claim in art and popular political discourse that we are \"beyond\" or \"post-\" identity. In challenging this latter claim, Seeing Differently critically examines how and why we \"identify\" works of art with an expressive subjectivity, noting the impossibility of claiming we are \"post-identity\" given the persistence of beliefs in art discourse and broader visual culture about who the subject \"is,\" and offers a new theory of how to think this kind of identification in a more thoughtful and self-reflexive way. Ultimately, Seeing Differently offers a mode of thinking identification as a \"queer feminist durational\" process that can never be fully resolved but must be accounted for in thinking about art and visual culture. Queer feminist durationality is a mode of relational interpretation that affects both \"art\" and \"interpreter,\" potentially making us more aware of how we evaluate and give value to art and other kinds of visual culture.","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Amelia"}],"citation-key":"jonesSeeingDifferentlyHistory2012","edition":"1 edition","event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon England ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-415-54383-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,4]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon England ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Seeing Differently: A History and Theory of Identification and the Visual Arts","title-short":"Seeing Differently","type":"book"},

  {"id":"kamathMDETRModulatedDetection2021","abstract":"Multi-modal reasoning systems rely on a pre-trained object detector to extract regions of interest from the image. However, this crucial module is typically used as a black box, trained independently of the downstream task and on a fixed vocabulary of objects and attributes. This makes it challenging for such systems to capture the long tail of visual concepts expressed in free form text. In this paper we propose MDETR, an end-to-end modulated detector that detects objects in an image conditioned on a raw text query, like a caption or a question. We use a transformer-based architecture to reason jointly over text and image by fusing the two modalities at an early stage of the model. We pre-train the network on 1.3M text-image pairs, mined from pre-existing multi-modal datasets having explicit alignment between phrases in text and objects in the image. We then fine-tune on several downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks. We also investigate the utility of our model as an object detector on a given label set when fine-tuned in a few-shot setting.

  {"id":"kangBiometricImaginariesFormatting2022","abstract":"This article examines the sociotechnical imaginary within which contemporary biometric listening or VIA (voice identification and analysis) technologies are being developed. Starting from an examination of a key article on Voiceprint identification written in the 1940s, I interrogate the conceptual link between voice, body, and identity, which was central to these early attempts at technologizing voice identification. By surveying patents that delineate systems for voice identification, collection methods for voice data, and voice analysis, I find that the VIA industry is dependent on the conceptual affixion of voice to identity based on a reduction of voice that sees it as a fixed, extractable, and measurable ?sound object? located within the body. This informs the thinking of developers in the VIA industry, resulting in a reframing of the technological shortcomings of voice identification under the rubric of big data. Ultimately, this reframing rationalizes the implementation of audio surveillance systems into existing telecommunications infrastructures through which voice data is acquired on a massive scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Edward B"}],"citation-key":"kangBiometricImaginariesFormatting2022","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/03063127221079599","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"581-602","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Biometric imaginaries: Formatting voice, body, identity to data","title-short":"Biometric imaginaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/03063127221079599","volume":"52"},

This article examines the sociotechnical assemblage of machine learning techniques, practices, and cultures that underlie these technologies. After engaging with various practitioners working in companies that develop machine listening systems, ranging from CEOs, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and business analysts, among others, I bring attention to the centrality of ?learnability? as a malleable conceptual framework that bends according to various ?ground-truthing? practices in formalizing certain listening-based prediction tasks for machine learning. In response, I introduce a process I call Ground Truth Tracings to examine the various ontological translations that occur in training a machine to ?learn to listen.? Ultimately, by further examining this notion of learnability through the aperture of power, I take insights acquired through my fieldwork in the machine listening industry and propose a strategically reductive heuristic through which the epistemological and ethical soundness of machine learning, writ large, can be contemplated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Edward B"}],"citation-key":"kangGroundTruthTracings2023","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517221146122","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20539517221146122","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Ground truth tracings (GTT): On the epistemic limits of machine learning","title-short":"Ground truth tracings (GTT)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221146122","volume":"10"},

This paper examines which quantitative metrics can be used to comparatively analyse human-computer co-creativity with children. To study this question, 24 schoolchildren of age 10–11 wrote a poem with three co-creative poetry writing processes: a human-computer, a human-human, and a human-human-computer process. The computational participant in the processes was an AI-based application called the Poetry Machine. The children were asked to evaluate their user experience with a 5-point Likert-type questionnaire after each writing process and a comparative questionnaire after finishing all processes. The metrics used in the evaluation were immediate fun, long-term enjoyment, creativity, self-expression, outcome satisfaction, ease of starting and finishing writing, quality of ideas and support from others, and ownership.Significant differences were found in fun, long-term enjoyment, quality of ideas, support, and ownership. The high number of statistically relevant results was enabled by exposing all participants to all writing processes, and the comparative questionnaire. The human-human-computer process was evaluated the best in long-term enjoyment and the human-computer process the weakest in support and idea quality. Creativity and ease of finishing writing turned out to be outlining metrics for the co-creative processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kantosalo","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Riihiaho","given":"Sirpa"}],"citation-key":"kantosaloQuantifyingCocreativeWriting2019","container-title":"Digital Creativity","DOI":"10.1080/14626268.2019.1575243","ISSN":"1462-6268","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,2]]},"page":"23-38","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Quantifying co-creative writing experiences","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2019.1575243","volume":"30"},

Researchers hope that models trained on these more challenging datasets will rely less on superficial patterns, and thus be less brittle. However, despite ADC's intuitive appeal, it remains unclear when training on adversarial datasets produces more robust models. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale controlled study focused on question answering, assigning workers at random to compose questions either (i) adversarially (with a model in the loop); or (ii) in the standard fashion (without a model). Across a variety of models and datasets, we find that models trained on adversarial data usually perform better on other adversarial datasets but worse on a diverse collection of out-of-domain evaluation sets. Finally, we provide a qualitative analysis of adversarial (vs standard) data, identifying key differences and offering guidance for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaushik","given":"Divyansh"},{"family":"Kiela","given":"Douwe"},{"family":"Lipton","given":"Zachary C."},{"family":"Yih","given":"Wen-tau"}],"citation-key":"kaushikEfficacyAdversarialData2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"number":"arXiv:2106.00872","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"On the Efficacy of Adversarial Data Collection for Question Answering: Results from a Large-Scale Randomized Study","title-short":"On the Efficacy of Adversarial Data Collection for Question Answering","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00872"},

Drawing on science and technology studies and feminist theory, this book examines the gendering of current and future media technologies such as smart phones, Google glass, robot nurses, tablets and face recognition. Kember argues that there is a tendency to affirm and celebrate the existence of smart and often sexist objects, environments and materials in themselves; to elide writing and other forms of mediation; and to engage in disembodied knowledge practices. Disembodied knowledge practices tend towards a scientism that currently includes physics envy and are also masculinist. Where there is some degree of convergence between masculinist and feminist thinking about objects, environments and materials, there is also divergence, conflict and the possible opening towards a politics of imedia. Presenting a lively manifesto for refiguring imedia, this book forms an often neglected gender critique of developments in smart technologies and will be essential reading for scholars in Communication Studies, Cultural and Media, Science and Technology and Feminism.","author":[{"family":"Kember","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"kemberIMediaGenderingObjects2016","ISBN":"978-1-137-37485-1","issued":{"literal":"-04-05 2016"},"language":"en","publisher":"Springer","title":"iMedia: The Gendering of Objects, Environments and Smart Materials","type":"book"},

In this paper, we seek to revisit and renew Adam’s arguments and methodology, exploring their resonances with current feminist concerns and their relevance to contemporary machine learning. Like Adam, we ask how new AI methods could be adapted for feminist purposes and what role new technologies might play in addressing concerns raised by feminist epistemologists and theorists about algorithmic systems. In particular, we highlight distributed and federated learning as providing partial solutions to the power-oriented concerns that have stymied efforts to make machine learning systems more representative and pluralist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Keyes","given":"Os"},{"family":"Creel","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"keyesArtificialKnowingOtherwise2022","container-title":"Feminist Philosophy Quarterly","ISSN":"2371-2570","issue":"3/4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Kathleen Creel, Os Keyes","number":"3/4","source":"ojs.lib.uwo.ca","title":"Artificial Knowing Otherwise","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/fpq/article/view/14313","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"keyesFeelingFixesMess2022","abstract":"Efforts to address algorithmic harms have gathered particular steam over the last few years. One area of proposed opportunity is the notion of an “algorithmic audit,” specifically an “internal audit,” a process in which a system’s developers evaluate its construction and likely consequences. These processes are broadly endorsed in theory—but how do they work in practice? In this paper, we conduct not only an audit but an autoethnography of our experiences doing so. Exploring the history and legacy of a facial recognition dataset, we find paradigmatic examples of algorithmic injustices. But we also find that the process of discovery is interwoven with questions of affect and infrastructural brittleness that internal audit processes fail to articulate. For auditing to not only address existing harms but avoid producing new ones in turn, we argue that these processes must attend to the “mess” of engaging with algorithmic systems in practice. Doing so not only reduces the risks of audit processes but—through a more nuanced consideration of the emotive parts of that mess—may enhance the benefits of a form of governance premised entirely on altering future practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Keyes","given":"Os"},{"family":"Austin","given":"Jeanie"}],"citation-key":"keyesFeelingFixesMess2022","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517221113772","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20539517221113772","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Feeling fixes: Mess and emotion in algorithmic audits","title-short":"Feeling fixes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221113772","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"khanSubjectsStagesAI2022","abstract":"There has been increased attention toward the datasets that are used to train and build AI technologies from the computer science and social science research communities, but less from legal scholarship. Both Large-Scale Language Datasets (LSLDs) and Large-Scale Computer Vision Datasets (LSCVDs) have been at the forefront of such discussions, due to recent controversies involving the use of facial recognition technologies, and the discussion of the use of publicly-available text for the training of massive models which generate human-like text. Many of these datasets serve as “benchmarks” to develop models that are used both in academic and industry research, while others are used solely for training models. The process of developing LSLDs and LSCVDs is complex and contextual, involving dozens of decisions about what kinds of data to collect, label, and train a model on, as well as how to make the data available to other researchers. However, little attention has been paid to mapping and consolidating the legal issues that arise at different stages of this process: when the data is being collected, after the data is used to build and evaluate models and applications, and how that data is distributed more widely. In this article, we offer four main contributions. First, we describe what kinds of objects these datasets are, how many different kinds exist, what types of modalities they encompass, and why they are important. Second, we provide more clarity about the stages of dataset development – a process that has thus far been subsumed within broader discussions about bias and discrimination – and the subjects who may be susceptible to harms at each point of development. Third, we provide a matrix of both the stages of dataset development and the subjects of dataset development, which traces the connections between stages and subjects. Fourth, we use this analysis to identify some basic legal issues that arise at the various stages in order to foster a better understanding of the dilemmas and tensions that arise at every stage. We situate our discussion within wider discussion of current debates and proposals related to algorithmic accountability. This paper fulfills an essential gap when it comes to comprehending the complicated landscape of legal issues connected to datasets and the gigantic AI models trained on them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Khan","given":"Mehtab"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"khanSubjectsStagesAI2022","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,13]]},"language":"en","number":"4217148","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"The Subjects and Stages of AI Dataset Development: A Framework for Dataset Accountability","title-short":"The Subjects and Stages of AI Dataset Development","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4217148"},

Using the continuity of text from books, we train an encoder-decoder model that tries to reconstruct the surrounding sentences of an encoded passage. Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice. We will make our encoder publicly available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kiros","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yukun"},{"family":"Salakhutdinov","given":"Ruslan"},{"family":"Zemel","given":"Richard S."},{"family":"Torralba","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Urtasun","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Fidler","given":"Sanja"}],"citation-key":"kirosSkipThoughtVectors2015","container-title":"arXiv:1506.06726 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,22]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Skip-Thought Vectors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726"},

  {"id":"koCriticallyConsciousComputing2023","abstract":"Computer science (CS) is often taught as a utopian discipline, full of powerful abstractions that can transform lives and society for the better. However, as computing has reshaped every part of society in both highly visible and highly invisible ways, it has become clear that the foundational ideas in CS carry explicit values: ones of automation, replacement, standardization, centralization, and amplification. These values have positioned it as a discipline of power, and due to the ignorance with which it is often applied, often one of oppression. In this book, we reconsider the technical and pedagogical foundations of CS and CS education from this lens, and offer teaching methods for secondary education that foster students' critical consciousness of computing, with the hope of fostering a more equitable, culturally sustaining, and just future of computing. \n\nThis book is a living document: 1) [submit|https://github.com/amyjko/critically-conscious-computing/issues] feedback on the book's GitHub page and 2) sign up for [email notifications|https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScFV9VgAoLUD-MKJSeEuw4kHrkMq9TbzfiEMLHX_jd5W0_3pA/viewform?usp=sf_link] of major revisions and new resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Ko","given":"Amy J"},{"family":"Beitlers","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Wortzman","given":"Brett"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Oleson","given":"Allanah"},{"family":"Kirdani-Ryan","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Druga","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Everson","given":"Jane"}],"citation-key":"koCriticallyConsciousComputing2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","source":"criticallyconsciouscomputing.org","title":"Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education","title-short":"Critically Conscious Computing","type":"book","URL":"https://bookish.press/undefined"},

Regardless of whether purported to be decentred and posthumanist, the subject conceived in poststructuralist and philosophical terms remains anthropocentric and anthropomorphic. There is something irrecuperably Cartesian in the poststructuralist idea of the subject. Physicality, both bodily and that of the materiality of the machinic prosthesis, is barred from the constitution of the Self, as the real is barred but also foreclosed to it. The subject, therefore, is yet another philosophical phantasm, which in its material actuality is determined as an instance of the signifying automaton. I argue that the “posthumanist” self, if conceived in Marxian and non-philosophical terms, ought to be viewed as the radical dyad of the signifying automaton and the real.

How did information come to be so integral to what we can do? How did we become people who effortlessly present our lives in social media profiles and who are meticulously recorded in state surveillance dossiers and online marketing databases? What is the story behind data coming to matter so much to who we are? In How We Became Our Data, Colin Koopman excavates early moments of our rapidly accelerating data-tracking technologies and their consequences for how we think of and express our selfhood today. Koopman explores the emergence of mass-scale record keeping systems like birth certificates and social security numbers, as well as new data techniques for categorizing personality traits, measuring intelligence, and even racializing subjects. This all culminates in what Koopman calls the “informational person” and the “informational power” we are now subject to. The recent explosion of digital technologies that are turning us into a series of algorithmic data points is shown to have a deeper and more turbulent past than we commonly think. Blending philosophy, history, political theory, and media theory in conversation with thinkers like Michel Foucault, Jürgen Habermas, and Friedrich Kittler, Koopman presents an illuminating perspective on how we have come to think of our personhood—and how we can resist its erosion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Koopman","given":"Colin"}],"citation-key":"koopmanHowWeBecame2019","DOI":"10.7208/9780226626611","ISBN":"978-0-226-62661-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,21]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"www-degruyter-com.libproxy1.usc.edu","title":"How We Became Our Data: A Genealogy of the Informational Person","title-short":"How We Became Our Data","type":"book","URL":"http://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.7208/9780226626611/html"},

This article adds to methodologies of self-care for the qualitative researcher by positioning the issue of self-care in the online field, where “regular” interactions based on race, gender, sexuality, and more may leave autoethnographers from marginalized communities especially vulnerable. This study complicates the conceptual boundaries of “audience,” “participation,” and “observation” for online autoethnographic research.

  {"id":"kostiContextBasedEmotion2019","abstract":"In our everyday lives and social interactions we often try to perceive the emotional states of people. There has been a lot of research in providing machines with a similar capacity of recognizing emotions. From a computer vision perspective, most of the previous efforts have been focusing in analyzing the facial expressions and, in some cases, also the body pose. Some of these methods work remarkably well in specific settings. However, their performance is limited in natural, unconstrained environments. Psychological studies show that the scene context, in addition to facial expression and body pose, provides important information to our perception of people's emotions. However, the processing of the context for automatic emotion recognition has not been explored in depth, partly due to the lack of proper data. In this paper we present EMOTIC, a dataset of images of people in a diverse set of natural situations, annotated with their apparent emotion. The EMOTIC dataset combines two different types of emotion representation: (1) a set of 26 discrete categories, and (2) the continuous dimensions Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. We also present a detailed statistical and algorithmic analysis of the dataset along with annotators' agreement analysis. Using the EMOTIC dataset we train different CNN models for emotion recognition, combining the information of the bounding box containing the person with the contextual information extracted from the scene. Our results show how scene context provides important information to automatically recognize emotional states and motivate further research in this direction.

  {"id":"kotliarDataOrientalismAlgorithmic2020","abstract":"Research on algorithms tends to focus on American companies and on the effects their algorithms have on Western users, while such algorithms are in fact developed in various geographical locations and used in highly diverse socio-cultural contexts. That is, the spatial trajectories through which algorithms operate and the distances and differences between the people who develop such algorithms and the users their algorithms affect remain overlooked. Moreover, while the power of big data algorithms has been recently compared to colonialism (Couldry and Mejias 2019), the move from the colonial gaze (Yegenoglu 1998) to the algorithmic gaze (Graham 2010) has yet to be fully discussed. This article aims to fill these gaps by exploring the attempts to algorithmically conceptualize “the Other” . Based on the case study of an Israeli user-profiling company and its attempts to sell its services to East Asian corporations, I show that the algorithmic gaze—algorithms’ ability to characterize, conceptualize, and affect users—stems from a complex combination between opposing-but-complimentary perspectives: that it is simultaneously a continuation of the colonial gaze and its complete opposite. The ways in which algorithms are being programmed to see the Other, the ways algorithmic categories are named to depict the Other, and the ways people who design such algorithms describe and understand the Other are all different but deeply interrelated factors in how algorithms “see.” I accordingly argue that the story of algorithms is an intercultural one, and that the power of algorithms perpetually flows back and forth—between East and West, South and North.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kotliar","given":"Dan M."}],"citation-key":"kotliarDataOrientalismAlgorithmic2020","container-title":"Theory and Society","container-title-short":"Theor Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s11186-020-09404-2","ISSN":"1573-7853","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"919-939","source":"Springer Link","title":"Data orientalism: on the algorithmic construction of the non-Western other","title-short":"Data orientalism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11186-020-09404-2","volume":"49"},

I contend that far from being a subculture that seeks to articulate a credible anti-establishment position, the alt-right is better understood as a polished, technologically adept strand of the far-right—a strand, what is more, that is easily assimilable by neoliberal socio-economic and political rationality.

The surprising output of one the experiments reveals that such networks might be used to trace relations between entities. This paper contributes by fleshing out the necessary changes in the ways HCI builds, tests, and engages neural networks in the design of interactive systems from a relational perspective; it proposes a hybrid approach where machine learning algorithms are used to identify objects as well as connections between them; finally, it argues for remaining open to ontological surprises in machine learning as they may enable the crafting of different relations with and through technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Leahu","given":"Lucian"}],"citation-key":"leahuOntologicalSurprisesRelational2016","collection-title":"DIS '16","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2016 ACM Conference on Designing Interactive Systems","DOI":"10.1145/2901790.2901840","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4031-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,4]]},"page":"182–186","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Ontological Surprises: A Relational Perspective on Machine Learning","title-short":"Ontological Surprises","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2901790.2901840"},

A two (male- vs. female-voice of Siri) by two (functional vs. social task) by two (matched vs. ummatched with participants’ gender) between-subjects experiment was performed with 163 participants. Higher levels of trust in cognitive dimensions were associated with functional tasks assisted by Siri, and one interaction between participants’ gender and Siri's gendered voice was observed in an affective dimension of trust, faith. Copresence dimension of social presence was associated with technical competence, understandability, faith, and personal attachment dimension of trust whereas psychological involvement was related with reliability and technical competence. Copresence, alongside faith and personal attachment, both affective dimensions of trust, seemed to facilitate comfortable feelings toward Siri imagined as various relational partners.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Sun Kyong"},{"family":"Kavya","given":"Pavitra"},{"family":"Lasser","given":"Sarah C."}],"citation-key":"leeSocialInteractionsRelationships2021","container-title":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","container-title-short":"International Journal of Human-Computer Studies","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhcs.2021.102608","ISSN":"1071-5819","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"102608","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Social interactions and relationships with an intelligent virtual agent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581921000264","volume":"150"},

Whereas young children routinely master these phenomena, learning systematic mappings between syntax and semantics, DALL-E 2 is unable to reliably infer meanings that are consistent with the syntax.

  {"id":"lepage-richerAdversarialityMachineLearning2021","abstract":"Since their introduction by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in the 1940s, neural networks have evolved from an experimentally inclined model of the mind to a powerful machine learning architecture. While this transformation is generally narrated as a story of linear progress, this piece argues that what traverses neural networks’ historical and current forms is a shared adversarial epistemology whose emergence coincides with neural networks’ initial adoption by cyberneticists and whose legacy informs current research in artificial intelligence. Bridging McCulloch and Norbert Wiener’s concerns with the evils of knowledge to the growing literature on inputs called “adversarial examples,” this chapter revisits the history of neural networks from the perspective of a larger reformulation of knowledge into the product of efforts to overcome an assumed adversary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lepage-Richer","given":"Théo"}],"citation-key":"lepage-richerAdversarialityMachineLearning2021","container-title":"The Cultural Life of Machine Learning: An Incursion into Critical AI Studies","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-56286-1_7","editor":[{"family":"Roberge","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Castelle","given":"Michael"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-56286-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"197-225","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Adversariality in Machine Learning Systems: On Neural Networks and the Limits of Knowledge","title-short":"Adversariality in Machine Learning Systems","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-56286-1_7"},

  {"id":"leslieEthicsComputationalSocial2023","abstract":"This chapter is concerned with setting up practical guardrails within the research activities and environments of Computational Social Science (CSS). It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the incorporation of end-to-end habits of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Leslie","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"leslieEthicsComputationalSocial2023","container-title":"Handbook of Computational Social Science for Policy","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_4","editor":[{"family":"Bertoni","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Fontana","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Gabrielli","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Signorelli","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Vespe","given":"Michele"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-16624-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"57-104","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Ethics of Computational Social Science","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-16624-2_4"},

  {"id":"lewisIndigenousProtocolArtificial2020","abstract":"This position paper on Indigenous Protocol (IP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a starting place for those who want to design and create AI from an ethical position that centers Indigenous concerns. Each Indigenous community will have its own particular approach to the questions we raise in what follows. What we have written here is not a substitute for establishing and maintaining relationships of reciprocal care and support with specific Indigenous communities. Rather, this document offers a range of ideas to take into consideration when entering into conversations which prioritize Indigenous perspectives in the development of artificial intelligence. It captures multiple layers of a discussion that happened over 20 months, across 20 time zones, during two workshops, and between Indigenous people (and a few non-Indigenous folks) from diverse communities in Aotearoa, Australia, North America, and the Pacific.  \n\nIndigenous ways of knowing are rooted in distinct, sovereign territories across the planet. These extremely diverse landscapes and histories have influenced different communities and their discrete cultural protocols over time. A single ‘Indigenous perspective’ does not exist, as epistemologies are motivated and shaped by the grounding of specific communities in particular territories. Historically, scholarly traditions that homogenize diverse Indigenous cultural practices have resulted in ontological and epistemological violence, and a flattening of the rich texture and variability of Indigenous thought. Our aim is to articulate a multiplicity of Indigenous knowledge systems and technological practices that can and should be brought to bear on the ‘question of AI.’\n \nTo that end, rather than being a unified statement this position paper is a collection of heterogeneous texts that range from design guidelines to scholarly essays to artworks to descriptions of technology prototypes to poetry. We feel such a somewhat multivocal and unruly format more accurately reflects the fact that this conversation is very much in an incipient stage as well as keeps the reader aware of the range of viewpoints expressed in the workshops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"Jason Edward"},{"family":"Abdilla","given":"Angie"},{"family":"Arista","given":"Noelani"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Kaipulaumakaniolono"},{"family":"Benesiinaabandan","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Michelle"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Meredith"},{"family":"Cordes","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Davison","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Duncan","given":"Kūpono"},{"family":"Garzon","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Harrell","given":"D.

  {"id":"liangHolisticEvaluationLanguage2023","abstract":"Language models (LMs) are becoming the foundation for almost all major language technologies, but their capabilities, limitations, and risks are not well understood. We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what’s missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios to the extent possible (87.5% of the time), ensuring that metrics beyond accuracy don’t fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs across models and metrics are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to more deeply analyze specific aspects (e.g. knowledge, reasoning, memorization/copyright, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, including 21 scenarios that were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on a set of core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings concerning the interplay between different scenarios, metrics, and models. For full transparency, we release all raw model prompts and completions publicly1 for further analysis, as well as a general modular toolkit for easily adding new scenarios, models, metrics, and prompting strategies.2 We intend for HELM to be a living benchmark for the community, continuously updated with new scenarios, metrics, and models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Percy"},{"family":"Bommasani","given":"Rishi"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Tsipras","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Soylu","given":"Dilara"},{"family":"Yasunaga","given":"Michihiro"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yian"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Deepak"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuhuai"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ananya"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Binhang"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Bobby"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ce"},{"family":"Cosgrove","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Manning","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Ré","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Acosta-Navas","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Drew A."},{"family":"Zelikman","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Durmus","given":"Esin"},{"family":"Ladhak","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Rong","given":"Frieda"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Hongyu"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Huaxiu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jue"},{"family":"Santhanam","given":"Keshav"},{"family":"Orr","given":"Laurel"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Yuksekgonul","given":"Mert"},{"family":"Suzgun","given":"Mirac"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Guha","given":"Neel"},{"family":"Chatterji","given":"Niladri"},{"family":"Khattab","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Sang Michael"},{"family":"Santurkar","given":"Shibani"},{"family":"Ganguli","given":"Surya"},{"family":"Hashimoto","given":"Tatsunori"},{"family":"Icard","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Vishrav"},{"family":"Wang","given":"William"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuechen"},{"family":"Mai","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuhui"},{"family":"Koreeda","given":"Yuta"}],"citation-key":"liangHolisticEvaluationLanguage2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2211.09110","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Holistic Evaluation of Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09110"},

  {"id":"linBiasRepairError2023","abstract":"Managing error has become an increasingly central and contested arena within data science work. While recent scholarship in artificial intelligence and machine learning has focused on limiting and eliminating error, practitioners have long used error as a site of collaboration and learning vis-à-vis labelers, domain experts, and the worlds data scientists seek to model and understand. Drawing from work in CSCW, STS, HCML, and repair studies, as well as from multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork within a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as an edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments. First, error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under 'working' systems. Second, error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors). Third, error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, often through restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise which recenter or devalue the position of different actors. We conclude by discussing how an artful living with error can better support the creative strategies of negotiation and adjustment which data scientists and their collaborators engage in when faced with disruption, breakdown, and friction in their work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Cindy Kaiying"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Steven J."}],"citation-key":"linBiasRepairError2023","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"liuEvaluatingVerifiabilityGenerative2023","abstract":"Generative search engines directly generate responses to user queries, along with in-line citations. A prerequisite trait of a trustworthy generative search engine is verifiability, i.e., systems should cite comprehensively (high citation recall; all statements are fully supported by citations) and accurately (high citation precision; every cite supports its associated statement). We conduct human evaluation to audit four popular generative search engines -- Bing Chat, NeevaAI, perplexity.ai, and YouChat -- across a diverse set of queries from a variety of sources (e.g., historical Google user queries, dynamically-collected open-ended questions on Reddit, etc.). We find that responses from existing generative search engines are fluent and appear informative, but frequently contain unsupported statements and inaccurate citations: on average, a mere 51.5% of generated sentences are fully supported by citations and only 74.5% of citations support their associated sentence. We believe that these results are concerningly low for systems that may serve as a primary tool for information-seeking users, especially given their facade of trustworthiness. We hope that our results further motivate the development of trustworthy generative search engines and help researchers and users better understand the shortcomings of existing commercial systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Nelson F."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Percy"}],"citation-key":"liuEvaluatingVerifiabilityGenerative2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.09848","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.09848","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Evaluating Verifiability in Generative Search Engines","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09848"},

  {"id":"liuQueerPsychologyAffect2017","abstract":"The affective turn that has emerged in academia problematizes the previous dichotomous conceptualization of essentialism and social constructionism. It also points toward a new direction for the study of human—and beyond human—experience. Situating this paradigm shift within broader social scientific inquiry, this paper engages with psychologist Silvan Tomkins’s and queer theorist Eve Sedgwick’s theories of affect. In doing so, it employs shame as a critical concept for queer psychology that is distinct from the sexual minority framework dominating North American LGBTQ psychology. The author proposes moving toward a concept of shame that identifies it as a curious engagement beyond disciplinary boundaries and movement that circulates through different sexualized and racialized bodies. In moving toward this concept and away from one of shame as a problem and an undesirable object to be rid of, we can work toward a queer psychology of affect that breaks open the binarism of pride and shame.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Wen"}],"citation-key":"liuQueerPsychologyAffect2017","container-title":"Subjectivity","container-title-short":"Subjectivity","DOI":"10.1057/s41286-016-0014-6","ISSN":"1755-635X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"44-62","source":"Springer Link","title":"Toward a queer psychology of affect: restarting from shameful places","title-short":"Toward a queer psychology of affect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41286-016-0014-6","volume":"10"},

The first phonographic archives featured collections of \"vocal portraits\" that prompted international investigations into the essential features of human voices for individual identification. Visual records of speech later found the same applications, but as \"voiceprint identification\" via sound spectrography began to achieve legal and commercial success in the 1960s, the procedure attracted more widespread scientific attention, which ultimately discredited both its accuracy and its rationale. At the same time, spectrogram collections spurred a new application—speech recognition by machine. The changing status of the speech spectrogram, from a record of unique features of individual voices to a model of fundamental invariants in speech sounds, was rooted in the demands of automated processing and a corresponding shift from the sound archive to the acoustic database.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaochang"},{"family":"Mills","given":"Mara"}],"citation-key":"liVocalFeaturesVoice2019","container-title":"Technology and Culture","DOI":"10.1353/tech.2019.0066","ISSN":"1097-3729","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"S129-S160","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Vocal Features: From Voice Identification to Speech Recognition by Machine","title-short":"Vocal Features","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/727301","volume":"60"},

Postmodernity is lived, it seems, at the end of history. In the essays collected in Local Transcendence, Alan Liu takes the pulse of such postmodern historicism by tracking two leading indicators of its acceleration in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries: postmodern cultural criticism—including the new historicism, the new cultural history, cultural anthropology, the new pragmatism, and postmodern and postindustrial theory—and digital information technology. What is the relation between the new historicist anecdote and the database field, Liu asks, and can either have a critical function in the age of postmodern historicism? Local Transcendence includes two previously unpublished essays and a synthetic introduction in which Liu traverses from his earlier work on the theory of historicism to his recent studies of information culture to propose a theory of contingent method incorporating a special inflection of history: media history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,6]]},"citation-key":"LocalTranscendenceEssays","language":"en","title":"Local transcendence: essays on postmodern historicism and the database. - University of Southern California","title-short":"Local transcendence","type":"book","URL":"http://uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_2131215423/01USC_INST:01USC"},

  {"id":"longeHavingWordYourself2010","abstract":"Self-criticism is strongly correlated with a range of psychopathologies, such as depression, eating disorders and anxiety. In contrast, self-reassurance is inversely associated with such psychopathologies. Despite the importance of self-judgements and evaluations, little is known about the neurophysiology of these internal processes. The current study therefore used a novel fMRI task to investigate the neuronal correlates of self-criticism and self-reassurance. Participants were presented statements describing two types of scenario, with the instruction to either imagine being self-critical or self-reassuring in that situation. One scenario type focused on a personal setback, mistake or failure, which would elicit negative emotions, whilst the second was of a matched neutral event. Self-criticism was associated with activity in lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions and dorsal anterior cingulate (dAC), therefore linking self-critical thinking to error processing and resolution, and also behavioural inhibition. Self-reassurance was associated with left temporal pole and insula activation, suggesting that efforts to be self-reassuring engage similar regions to expressing compassion and empathy towards others. Additionally, we found a dorsal/ventral PFC divide between an individual's tendency to be self-critical or self-reassuring. Using multiple regression analyses, dorsolateral PFC activity was positively correlated with high levels of self-criticism (assessed via self-report measure), suggesting greater error processing and behavioural inhibition in such individuals. Ventrolateral PFC activity was positively correlated with high self-reassurance. Our findings may have implications for the neural basis of a range of mood disorders that are characterised by a preoccupation with personal mistakes and failures, and a self-critical response to such events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Longe","given":"Olivia"},{"family":"Maratos","given":"Frances A."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Gaynor"},{"family":"Volker","given":"Faye"},{"family":"Rockliff","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Rippon","given":"Gina"}],"citation-key":"longeHavingWordYourself2010","container-title":"NeuroImage","container-title-short":"NeuroImage","DOI":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.09.019","ISSN":"1053-8119","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1849-1856","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Having a word with yourself: Neural correlates of self-criticism and self-reassurance","title-short":"Having a word with yourself","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909009987","volume":"49"},

The ML community has recently made significant improvements to data stewardship and documentation practices across the model development life cycle. However, the act of deprecating, or deleting, datasets has been largely overlooked, and there are currently no standardized approaches for structuring this stage of the dataset life cycle. In this paper, we study the practice of dataset deprecation in ML, identify several cases of datasets that continued to circulate despite having been deprecated, and describe the different technical, legal, ethical, and organizational issues raised by such continuations. We then propose a Dataset Deprecation Framework that includes considerations of risk, mitigation of impact, appeal mechanisms, timeline, post-deprecation protocols, and publication checks that can be adapted and implemented by the ML community. Finally, we propose creating a centralized, sustainable repository system for archiving datasets, tracking dataset modifications or deprecations, and facilitating practices of care and stewardship that can be integrated into research and publication processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Luccioni","given":"Alexandra Sasha"},{"family":"Corry","given":"Frances"},{"family":"Sridharan","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Ananny","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Schultz","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"luccioniFrameworkDeprecatingDatasets2022","collection-title":"FAccT '22","container-title":"2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3531146.3533086","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9352-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"page":"199–212","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A Framework for Deprecating Datasets: Standardizing Documentation, Identification, and Communication","title-short":"A Framework for Deprecating Datasets","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533086"},

In this essay, I draw on key perspectives espoused in feminist materialism, vital materialism and the anthropology of material culture to examine the ways in which these assemblages operate as part of knowing, perceiving and sensing human bodies. I draw particularly on scholarship that employs organic metaphors and concepts of vitality, growth, making, articulation, composition and decomposition. I show how these metaphors and concepts relate to and build on each other, and how they can be applied to think through humans’ encounters with their digital data. I argue that these theoretical perspectives work to highlight the material and embodied dimensions of human–data assemblages as they grow and are enacted, articulated and incorporated into everyday lives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Lupton","given":"Deborah"}],"citation-key":"luptonHowDataCome2018a","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/2053951718786314","ISSN":"2053-9517, 2053-9517","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"205395171878631","source":"Crossref","title":"How do data come to matter?

Although an increasing number of studies have explored relationships between compassion and different facets of psychopathology there has as yet been no systematic review or synthesis of the empirical literature. We conducted a systematic search of the literature on compassion and mental health. We identified 20 samples from 14 eligible studies. All studies used the Neff Self Compassion Scale (Neff, 2003b). We employed meta-analysis to explore associations between self-compassion and psychopathology using random effects analyses of Fisher's Z correcting for attenuation arising from scale reliability. We found a large effect size for the relationship between compassion and psychopathology of r=−0.54 (95% CI=−0.57 to −0.51; Z=−34.02; p<.0001). Heterogeneity was significant in the analysis. There was no evidence of significant publication bias. Compassion is an important explanatory variable in understanding mental health and resilience. Future work is needed to develop the evidence base for compassion in psychopathology, and explore correlates of compassion and psychopathology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"MacBeth","given":"Angus"},{"family":"Gumley","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"macbethExploringCompassionMetaanalysis2012","container-title":"Clinical Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clinical Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.cpr.2012.06.003","ISSN":"0272-7358","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,1]]},"page":"545-552","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Exploring compassion: A meta-analysis of the association between self-compassion and psychopathology","title-short":"Exploring compassion","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027273581200092X","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"mackenziePerformativityCodeSoftware2005","abstract":"This article analyses a specific piece of computer code, the Linux operating system kernel, as an example of how technical operationality figures in contemporary culture. The analysis works at two levels. First of all, it attempts to account for the increasing visibility and significance of code or software-related events. Second, it seeks to extend familiar concepts of performativity to include cultural processes in which the creation of meaning is not central, and in which processes of circulation play a primary role. The analysis concentrates on the practices and patterns of circulation of Linux through versions, distributions, clones and reconfigurations. It argues that technical ‘culture-objects’ such as Linux take on a social existence within contemporary technological cultures because of the authorizing contexts in which the reading, writing and execution of code occur. The ‘force’ or performance of certain technical objects, their operationality, can be understood more as the stabilized nexus of diverse social practices, rules and personae than as a formal property of the objects themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"mackenziePerformativityCodeSoftware2005","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276405048436","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"71-92","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Performativity of Code: Software and Cultures of Circulation","title-short":"The Performativity of Code","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276405048436","volume":"22"},

Seeing – as a position from a singular mode of observation – has become problematic since many visual elements, techniques, and forms of observing are highly distributed through data practices of collection, analysis and prediction. Such practices are subtended by visual cultural techniques that are grounded in the development of image collections, image formatting and hardware design. In this article, we analyze recent transformations in forms of prediction and data analytics associated with spectacular performances of computation. We analyze how transformations in the collection and accumulation of images as ensembles by platforms have a qualitative and material effect on the emergent sociotechnicality of platform ‘life’ and ‘perception’. Reconstructing the visual transformations that allow artificial intelligence assemblages to operate allows some sense of their heteronomous materiality and contingency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"MacKenzie","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Munster","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"mackenziePlatformSeeingImage2019","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276419847508","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-22","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Platform Seeing: Image Ensembles and Their Invisualities","title-short":"Platform Seeing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276419847508","volume":"36"},

How is it that machine learning can promise to predict with great specificity what differences matter or what people want in many different settings? We need, I suggest, an account of its generalization if we are to understand the contemporary production of prediction. This article maps the principal forms of material action, narrative and problematization that run across algorithmic modelling techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees and Naive Bayes classifiers. It highlights several interlinked modes of generalization that engender increasingly vast data infrastructures and platforms, and intensified mathematical and statistical treatments of differences. Such an account also points to some key sites of instability or problematization inherent to the process of generalization. If movement through data is becoming a principal intersection of power relations, economic value and valid knowledge, an account of the production of prediction might also help us begin to ask how its generalization potentially gives rise to new forms of agency, experience or individuations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"mackenzieProductionPredictionWhat2015","container-title":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367549415577384","ISSN":"1367-5494","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"429-445","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The production of prediction: What does machine learning want?","title-short":"The production of prediction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367549415577384","volume":"18"},

Many settings, ranging across finance, social media, biomedical science and military planning, rely on a semi-automated form of statistics – sometimes called ‘machine learning’ – to generate the predictions on which anticipation relies. Anticipation takes hold as these settings incorporate predictivity focused on the attributes of populations and individuals. What kinds of subjects live in the regime of anticipation? Shifts in predictive practice directly index the re-shaping of subjectivity in anticipation. Exploring the use of machine learning in social media, this article examines predictive practice of anticipation. It shows how software developers and programmers not only become agents of anticipation, but also internalise regimes of anticipation through technical practices. Shifts in programming practice hint at what it is like to be an agent of anticipation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackenzie","given":"Adrian"}],"citation-key":"mackenzieProgrammingSubjectsRegime2013","container-title":"Subjectivity","container-title-short":"Subjectivity","DOI":"10.1057/sub.2013.12","ISSN":"1755-635X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"391-405","source":"Springer Link","title":"Programming subjects in the regime of anticipation: Software studies and subjectivity","title-short":"Programming subjects in the regime of anticipation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/sub.2013.12","volume":"6"},

However, prior research has highlighted gaps between the intended design of these tools and practices and their use within particular contexts, including gaps caused by the role that organizational factors play in shaping fairness work. In this paper, we investigate these gaps for one such practice: disaggregated evaluations of AI systems, intended to uncover performance disparities between demographic groups. By conducting semi-structured interviews and structured workshops with thirty-three AI practitioners from ten teams at three technology companies, we identify practitioners' processes, challenges, and needs for support when designing disaggregated evaluations. We find that practitioners face challenges when choosing performance metrics, identifying the most relevant direct stakeholders and demographic groups on which to focus, and collecting datasets with which to conduct disaggregated evaluations. More generally, we identify impacts on fairness work stemming from a lack of engagement with direct stakeholders or domain experts, business imperatives that prioritize customers over marginalized groups, and the drive to deploy AI systems at scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Madaio","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Egede","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Subramonyam","given":"Hariharan"},{"family":"Wortman Vaughan","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Wallach","given":"Hanna"}],"citation-key":"madaioAssessingFairnessAI2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"maleveDataSetRuins2021","abstract":"Computer vision aims to produce an understanding of digital image’s content and the generation or transformation of images through software. Today, a significant amount of computer vision algorithms rely on techniques of machine learning which require large amounts of data assembled in collections, or named data sets.

  {"id":"marenkoAnimisticDesignHow2016","abstract":"This article puts forward the notion of animistic design as an uncertainty-driven strategy to reimagine human–machine interaction as a milieu of human and nonhuman. Animistic design is suggested as capable of fostering affects, sensibilities and thoughts that capitalize on the uncertain, the unpredictable and the nonlinear, and their capacity to trigger creative pathways. Informed by post-human philosophies, theories of mediation and materiality, as well as by affect, agency and aesthesia, animistic design eschews the anthropomorphic and the cute playfulness often associated with animism. Instead, it proposes a practical–theoretical framework to articulate the nexus of digital innovation, interaction design practices, technical materialities and affective responses already emerging in the digital cohabitation of the human and the nonhuman. Using a ‘research through making’ approach, the article describes in detail a series of animistic design experiments and prototyping methods that explore ways of rethinking interaction as an open-ended and creative enterprise. Animistic design offers an investigative strategy that exploits degrees of collaboratively curated uncertainty and unpredictability to imagine forms of digital interaction, and to engender creative human–nonhuman relationships within a given digital milieu.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Marenko","given":"Betti"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Philip","dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"marenkoAnimisticDesignHow2016","container-title":"Digital Creativity","DOI":"10.1080/14626268.2016.1145127","ISSN":"1462-6268","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,2]]},"page":"52-70","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Animistic design: how to reimagine digital interaction between the human and the nonhuman","title-short":"Animistic design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2016.1145127","volume":"27"},

As the author notes, code's \"meaning is not determined entirely by the programmer's intention but also by how it is received and recirculated. That is not to argue that code can be taken out of context or that code means whatever people say it means but rather that the meaning of code is contingent and that code is subject to the rhetorical triad of speaker, audience (both human and machine), and message.\" It is time to develop methods of tracing the meaning of code. Computer source code has become part of our political, legal, aesthetic, and popular discourse. Code is being read by lawyers, corporate managers, artists, pundits, reporters, and even literary scholars. Code is being used in political debate, in artistic exhibitions, in popular entertainment, and in historical accounts. As code reaches more and more readers and as programming languages and methods continue to evolve, we need to develop methods to account for the way code accrues meaning and how the readers and shifting contexts shape that meaning. We need to learn not only to understand the functioning of code but the way code signifies. We need to learn to read code critically.

  {"id":"marwickDrinkingMaleTears2018","abstract":"While popular discourse often frames online harassment as an issue of individuals engaged in abhorrent behavior, harassing behavior is often networked in that it is coordinated and organized. When feminists and female public figures experience harassment, it often originates from members of a loose online network known as the manosphere, a set of blogs, podcasts, and forums comprised of pickup artists, men's rights activists, anti-feminists, and fringe groups. While the particular beliefs of these groups may differ, many participants have adopted a common language. This paper explores the discourse of the manosphere and its links to online misogyny and harassment. Using critical discourse analysis, we examine the term misandry, which originates in the manosphere; trace its infiltration into more mainstream circles; and analyze its ideological and community-building functions. We pay particular attention to how this vocabulary reinforces a misogynistic ontology which paints feminism as a man-hating movement which victimizes men and boys.","author":[{"family":"Marwick","given":"Alice E."},{"family":"Caplan","given":"Robyn"}],"citation-key":"marwickDrinkingMaleTears2018","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2018.1450568","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,4]]},"language":"English","page":"543-559","title":"Drinking male tears: language, the manosphere, and networked harassment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680777.2018.1450568","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"matternCodeClayData2017","abstract":"For years, pundits have trumpeted the earthshattering changes that big data and smart networks will soon bring to our cities. But what if cities have long been built for intelligence, maybe for millennia? In <i>Code and Clay, Data and Dirt</i> Shannon Mattern advances the provocative argument that our urban spaces have been \"smart\" and mediated for thousands of years.  Offering powerful new ways of thinking about our cities, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt goes far beyond the standard historical concepts of origins, development, revolutions, and the accomplishments of an elite few. Mattern shows that in their architecture, laws, street layouts, and civic knowledge-and through technologies including the telephone, telegraph, radio, printing, writing, and even the human voice-cities have long negotiated a rich exchange between analog and digital, code and clay, data and dirt, ether and ore.  Mattern's vivid prose takes readers through a historically and geographically broad range of stories, scenes, and locations, synthesizing a new narrative for our urban spaces. Taking media archaeology to the city's streets, <i>Code and Clay, Data and Dirt</i> reveals new ways to write our urban, media, and cultural histories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Mattern","given":"Shannon"}],"citation-key":"matternCodeClayData2017","DOI":"10.5749/j.ctt1pwt6rn","ISBN":"978-1-5179-0244-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Code and Clay, Data and Dirt: Five Thousand Years of Urban Media","title-short":"Code and Clay, Data and Dirt","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt6rn"},

Its early history was marked by opposition from, in particular, Noam Chomsky, who favored a rationalist view over the empiricism associated with corpus-based approaches. However, corpora have been shown to be highly useful in a range of areas of linguistics (but perhaps most notably lexicography and grammatical description). Modern corpus linguistics was formed in the context of work on English, though it is now applied to many different languages; it was in this context that techniques such as corpus annotation, and important concepts such as collocation, emerged. Alongside this history of corpus linguistics considered as a methodology stands the history of an alternative approach, sometimes called neo-Firthian, within which the study of words, phraseology and collocation in corpora are the keystone of linguistic theory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McEnery","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Hardie","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"mceneryHistoryCorpusLinguistics2013","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199585847.013.0034","editor":[{"family":"Allan","given":"Keith"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-958584-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"page":"0","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Silverchair","title":"The History of Corpus Linguistics","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199585847.013.0034"},

Such “network effects” offer lucrative opportunities for firms that can leverage these dynamics to create dominant technology platforms.

However, this body of research has not sufficiently addressed the ability of certain platform sponsors to persist over time, despite the existence of competing platforms or new entrants. Drawing upon research on network effects, competitive dynamics, and complementor interaction, we develop propositions highlighting the role of network, platform, and complementor attributes that facilitate or hinder the persistence of a technology-based platform in the market. In doing so, we conceptualize platform dominance as part of a dynamic process, rather than a static outcome as often characterized by previous literature. Our propositions advance research on digital platform strategy and user networks by examining the factors that enhance the continued viability of a platform, and generates a number of important directions for future research on technology management, innovation, and strategy, as well as for managerial practice in platform-mediated markets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"McIntyre","given":"David P."},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Arati"},{"family":"Chintakananda","given":"Asda"}],"citation-key":"mcintyrePersistencePlatformsRole2020","container-title":"Long Range Planning","container-title-short":"Long Range Planning","DOI":"10.1016/j.lrp.2020.101987","ISSN":"0024-6301","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"101987","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The persistence of platforms: The role of network, platform, and complementor attributes","title-short":"The persistence of platforms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002463011830428X"},

In doing so, these artists raised new ways to ponder the intersections of art, performance, and black female embodiment. McMillan reframes the concept of the avatar in the service of black performance art, describing black women performers’ skillful manipulation of synthetic selves and adroit projection of their performances into other representational mediums. A bold rethinking of performance art, Embodied Avatars analyzes daring performances of alterity staged by “ancient negress” Joice Heth and fugitive slave Ellen Craft, seminal artists Adrian Piper and Howardena Pindell, and contemporary visual and music artists Simone Leigh and Nicki Minaj. Fusing performance studies with literary analysis and visual culture studies, McMillan offers astute readings of performances staged in theatrical and quotidian locales, from freak shows to the streets of 1970s New York; in literary texts, from artists’ writings to slave narratives; and in visual and digital mediums, including engravings, photography, and video art. Throughout, McMillan reveals how these performers manipulated the dimensions of objecthood, black performance art, and avatars in a powerful re-scripting of their bodies while enacting artful forms of social misbehavior.

She then asks what it might mean to design―from conception―digital tools and applications that emerge from contextual concerns of cultural theory and, in particular, from a feminist concern for difference. This path leads back to the Vectors Lab and its ongoing efforts at the intersection of theory and praxis.","author":[{"family":"McPherson","given":"Tara"}],"citation-key":"mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London, England","ISBN":"978-0-674-72894-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,19]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"280","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts ; London, England","source":"Amazon","title":"Feminist in a Software Lab: Difference + Design","title-short":"Feminist in a Software Lab","type":"book"},

  {"id":"megarryWatchfulEyesMen2018","abstract":"While early internet research often explored social media’s potential for increasing political participation, scholars are now problematising the manifestations of state and corporate control over political activism in these spaces. Yet despite an increased academic focus on the shape and implications of online power relations, there is a noticeable lack of critical theory that considers how strategies of male dominance on social media platforms influence feminist activism. This article conceptualises individual men as monitorial actors invested in surveilling feminist speech online, and brings together literature from within feminist, social movement, and critical internet studies to address this research gap. Situating contemporary feminist activist tactics in relation to second-wave priorities, this article extends current conceptualisations of the dangers of social media surveillance practices for political action. It draws on recent examples of online feminist organising to elucidate the ways in which social media platforms provide men with increased opportunities to surveil feminist activity. The article calls for further research into the ways in which male surveillance practices on social media platforms are shaping women’s ability to organise for social change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Megarry","given":"Jessica"}],"citation-key":"megarryWatchfulEyesMen2018","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2017.1387584","ISSN":"1468-0777","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,2]]},"page":"1070-1085","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Under the watchful eyes of men: theorising the implications of male surveillance practices for feminist activism on social media","title-short":"Under the watchful eyes of men","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2017.1387584","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"mehrabiSurveyBiasFairness2022","abstract":"With the widespread use of AI systems and applications in our everyday lives, it is important to take fairness issues into consideration while designing and engineering these types of systems. Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mehrabi","given":"Ninareh"},{"family":"Morstatter","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Saxena","given":"Nripsuta"},{"family":"Lerman","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Galstyan","given":"Aram"}],"citation-key":"mehrabiSurveyBiasFairness2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"number":"arXiv:1908.09635","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Survey on Bias and Fairness in Machine Learning","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09635"},
  {"id":"melbyFutureMachineTranslation2019","abstract":"Machine Translation (MT) has seen fluctuating periods of growth and attention since the 1950s, with the primary leading paradigms shifting from rule-based (RBMT) to statistical (SMT), and now neural (NMT). This chapter aims to analyse the seeds of these paradigms through a 1949 memorandum by Warren Weaver that presents five hypothetical approaches to MT. They are: word-for-word translation; disambiguation using micro context (i.e. co-text); an approach based on formal logic; a cryptography approach to translation as decoding; and translation based on invariants (universal symbolic representation of meaning). This chapter shows how some developments external to the translation industry have enabled the realization of Weaver’s vision and discusses various connections among the seeds, the enabling developments and the three machine-translation paradigms. The chapter concludes with a discussion of possible directions for the future of MT and its connection with human translation.","author":[{"family":"Melby","given":"Alan K."}],"citation-key":"melbyFutureMachineTranslation2019","container-title":"The Routledge Handbook of Translation and Technology","ISBN":"978-1-315-31125-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"18","publisher":"Routledge","title":"Future of machine translation: Musings on Weaver's memo","title-short":"Future of machine translation","type":"chapter"},

Very often, organizations outsource processes related to data work (i.e., generating and annotating data and evaluating outputs) through business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and crowdsourcing platforms. This paper investigates outsourced ML data work in Latin America by studying three platforms in Venezuela and a BPO in Argentina. We lean on the Foucauldian notion of dispositif to define the data-production dispositif as an ensemble of discourses, actions, and objects strategically disposed to (re)produce power/knowledge relations in data and labor. Our dispositif analysis comprises the examination of 210 data work instruction documents, 55 interviews with data workers, managers, and requesters, and participant observation. Our findings show that discourses encoded in instructions reproduce and normalize the worldviews of requesters. Precarious working conditions and economic dependency alienate workers, making them obedient to instructions. Furthermore, discourses and social contexts materialize in artifacts, such as interfaces and performance metrics, limiting workers' agency and normalizing specific ways of interpreting data. We conclude by stressing the importance of counteracting the data-production dispositif by fighting alienation and precarization, and empowering data workers to become assets in the quest for high-quality data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Miceli","given":"Milagros"},{"family":"Posada","given":"Julian"}],"citation-key":"miceliDataProductionDispositif2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.11963","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,24]]},"number":"arXiv:2205.11963","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Data-Production Dispositif","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11963"},

  {"id":"miceliStudyingMachineLearning2021","abstract":"Research in machine learning (ML) has primarily argued that models trained on incomplete or biased datasets can lead to discriminatory outputs. In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to \"study up\" ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our community -- one bias-oriented, the other power-aware. This way, we highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation.

  {"id":"miceliStudyingMachineLearning2022","abstract":"Research in machine learning (ML) has argued that models trained on incomplete or biased datasets can lead to discriminatory outputs. In this commentary, we propose moving the research focus beyond bias-oriented framings by adopting a power-aware perspective to \"study up\" ML datasets. This means accounting for historical inequities, labor conditions, and epistemological standpoints inscribed in data. We draw on HCI and CSCW work to support our argument, critically analyze previous research, and point at two co-existing lines of work within our research community \\,---\\,one bias-centered, the other power-aware. We highlight the need for dialogue and cooperation in three areas: data quality, data work, and data documentation.

  {"id":"minskyFrameworkRepresentingKnowledge1974","abstract":"This is a partial theory of thinking, combining  a number of classical and modern concepts  from psychology, linguistics, and AI. Whenever  one encounters a new situation (or makes a  substantial change in one's viewpoint) he  selects from memory a structure called a  frame, a remembered framework to be  adopted to fit reality by changing details as  necessary. A frame is a data-structure for  representing a stereotyped situation, like  being in a certain kind of living room, or going  to a child's birthday party. Attached to each  frame are several kinds of information. Some  of this information is about how to use the  frame. Some is about what one can expect to  happen next. Some is about what to do if  these expectations are not confirmed. The  \"top levels\" of a frame are fixed, and represent  things that are always true about the  supposed situation. The lower levels have  many \"slots\" that must be filled by specific  instances or data. Collections of related  frames are linked together into frame-systems. The effects of important actions are  mirrored by transformations between the  frames of a system. These are used to make  certain kinds of calculations economical, to  represent changes of emphasis and attention  and to account for effectiveness of \"imagery\".  In Vision, the different frames of a system  describe the scene from different viewpoints,  and the transformations between one frame  and another represent the effects of moving  from place to place. Other kinds of frame-systems can represent actions, cause-effect  relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint.  The paper applies the frame-system idea  also to problems of linguistic understanding:  memory, acquisition and retrieval of  knowledge, and a variety of ways to reason by  analogy and jump to conclusions based on  partial similarity matching.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Minsky","given":"Marvin"}],"citation-key":"minskyFrameworkRepresentingKnowledge1974","issued":{"date-parts":[["1974",6,1]]},"language":"en_US","note":"Accepted: 2004-10-04T14:38:58Z","source":"dspace.mit.edu","title":"A Framework for Representing Knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6089"},
  {"id":"mitchellModelCardsModel2019","abstract":"Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Zaldivar","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Parker"},{"family":"Vasserman","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Spitzer","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Raji","given":"Inioluwa Deborah"},{"family":"Gebru","given":"Timnit"}],"citation-key":"mitchellModelCardsModel2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3287560.3287596","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,29]]},"page":"220-229","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Model Cards for Model Reporting","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993"},

Even with today's seemingly fast pace of AI breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself.

In such cases, we need help from models.

In it, Nick Montfort reveals programming to be not merely a technical exercise within given constraints but a tool for sketching, brainstorming, and inquiring about important topics. He emphasizes programming's exploratory potential―its facility to create new kinds of artworks and to probe data for new ideas. The book is designed to be read alongside the computer, allowing readers to program while making their way through the chapters. It offers practical exercises in writing and modifying code, beginning on a small scale and increasing in substance. In some cases, a specification is given for a program, but the core activities are a series of “free projects,” intentionally underspecified exercises that leave room for readers to determine their own direction and write different sorts of programs. Throughout the book, Montfort also considers how computation and programming are culturally situated―how programming relates to the methods and questions of the arts and humanities. The book uses Python and Processing, both of which are free software, as the primary programming languages.","author":[{"family":"Montfort","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"montfortExploratoryProgrammingArts2016","edition":"1 edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-03420-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,8]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"328","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Amazon","title":"Exploratory Programming for the Arts and Humanities","type":"book"},

  {"id":"morinSelfReflectionInnerVoice2012","abstract":"Inner speech involvement in self-reflection was examined by reviewing 130 studies assessing brain activation during self-referential processing in key self-domains: agency, self-recognition, emotions, personality traits, autobiographical memory, and miscellaneous (e.g., prospection, judgments). The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been shown to be reliably recruited during inner speech production. The percentage of studies reporting LIFG activity for each self-dimension was calculated. Fifty five percent of all studies reviewed indicated LIFG (and presumably inner speech) activity during self-reflection tasks; on average LIFG activation is observed 16% of the time during completion of non-self tasks (e.g., attention, perception). The highest LIFG activation rate was observed during retrieval of autobiographical information. The LIFG was significantly more recruited during conceptual tasks (e.g., prospection, traits) than during perceptual tasks (agency and self-recognition). This constitutes additional evidence supporting the idea of a participation of inner speech in self-related thinking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Morin","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Hamper","given":"Breanne"}],"citation-key":"morinSelfReflectionInnerVoice2012","container-title":"The Open Neuroimaging Journal","container-title-short":"Open Neuroimag J","DOI":"10.2174/1874440001206010078","ISSN":"1874-4400","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,7]]},"page":"78-89","PMCID":"PMC3462327","PMID":"23049653","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Self-Reflection and the Inner Voice: Activation of the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus During Perceptual and Conceptual Self-Referential Thinking","title-short":"Self-Reflection and the Inner Voice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462327/","volume":"6"},

AI has the capacity to reinforce historical injustice, to amplify labor precarity, and to cement forms of racial and gendered inequality. An alternate set of values, paradigms, and priorities are urgently needed. How might we design and evaluate AI from an indigenous perspective? This article draws upon the five Tests developed by Māori scholar Sir Hirini Moko Mead. This framework, informed by Māori knowledge and concepts, provides a method for assessing contentious issues and developing a Māori position. This paper takes up these tests, considers how each test might be applied to data-driven systems, and provides a number of concrete examples.

The specific ways F/LOSS instantiates notions of openness in everyday practice exacerbates the exclusion of women. ‘Openness’ is a complex construct that affects more than intellectual property arrangements. It weaves together ideas about authorship, agency, and the circumstances under which knowledge and code can and cannot be exchanged. While open source developers believe technology is orthogonal to the social, notions of openness tie the social to the technical by separating persons from one another and relieving them of obligations that might be created in the course of other forms of gift exchange. In doing so, men monopolize code authorship and simultaneously de-legitimize the kinds of social ties necessary to build mechanisms for women’s inclusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Nafus","given":"Dawn"}],"citation-key":"nafusPatchesDonHave2012","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444811422887","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"669-683","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"‘Patches don’t have gender’: What is not open in open source software","title-short":"‘Patches don’t have gender’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444811422887","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"nakamuraBlamingShamingFeminization2015","abstract":"Questions of gender, race, class, and sexuality have largely been left unexamined in surveillance studies. The contributors to this field-defining collection take up these questions, and in so doing provide new directions for analyzing surveillance. They use feminist theory to expose the ways in which surveillance practices and technologies are tied to systemic forms of discrimination that serve to normalize whiteness, able-bodiedness, capitalism, and heterosexuality. The essays discuss the implications of, among others, patriarchal surveillance in colonial North America, surveillance aimed at curbing the trafficking of women and sex work, women presented as having agency in the creation of the images that display their bodies via social media, full-body airport scanners, and mainstream news media discussion of honor killings in Canada and the concomitant surveillance of Muslim bodies. Rather than rehashing arguments as to whether or not surveillance keeps the state safe, the contributors investigate what constitutes surveillance, who is scrutinized, why, and at what cost. The work fills a gap in feminist scholarship and shows that gender, race, class, and sexuality should be central to any study of surveillance. Contributors.

In the face of concerns about high-tech pollution, increasingly empowered labor organizations, and a newly politicized and visible American Indian civil rights movement, indigenous electronic workers at Shiprock were pressed into service as examples of the peaceful coexistence and integration of the past and the future, the primitive and the modern, creativity and capitalism. Navajo women workers were described as ideal predigital digital workers, uniquely suited to the job by temperament, culture, and gender. Their labor as platform builders was cited as evidence that digital work—the work of the hand and its digits—could be painlessly transferred from the indigenous cultural context into the world of technological commercial innovation, benefiting both in the process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"nakamuraIndigenousCircuitsNavajo2014","container-title":"American Quarterly","ISSN":"1080-6490","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"919-941","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"Indigenous Circuits: Navajo Women and the Racialization of Early Electronic Manufacture","title-short":"Indigenous Circuits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/563663","volume":"66"},

  {"id":"nassCanComputerPersonalities1995","abstract":"The claim that computer personalities can be human personalities was tested by demonstrating that (1) computer personalities can be easily created using a minimal set of cues, and (2) that people will respond to these personalities in the same way they would respond to similar human personalities. The present study focused on the \"similarity-attraction hypothesis,\" which predicts that people will prefer to interact with others who are similar in personality. In a 2 × 2, balanced, between-subjects experiment (n = 48), dominant and submissive subjects were randomly matched with a computer that was endowed with the properties associated with dominance or submissiveness. Subjects recognized the computer's personality type, distinct from friendliness and competence. In addition, subjects not only preferred the similar computer, but they were more satisfied with the interaction. The findings demonstrate that personality does not require richly defined agents, sophisticated pictorial representations, nautral language processing, or artificial intelligence. Rather, even the most superficial manipulations are sufficient to exhibit personality, with powerful effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Nass","given":"Clifford"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Youngme"},{"family":"Fogg","given":"B.

  {"id":"neffAutomationAlgorithmsPolitics2016","abstract":"In 2016, Microsoft launched Tay, an experimental artificial intelligence chat bot. Learning from interactions with Twitter users, Tay was shut down after one day because of its obscene and inflammatory tweets. This article uses the case of Tay to re-examine theories of agency. How did users view the personality and actions of an artificial intelligence chat bot when interacting with Tay on Twitter? Using phenomenological research methods and pragmatic approaches to agency, we look at what people said about Tay to study how they imagine and interact with emerging technologies and to show the limitations of our current theories of agency for describing communication in these settings. We show how different qualities of agency, different expectations for technologies, and different capacities for affordance emerge in the interactions between people and artificial intelligence. We argue that a perspective of “symbiotic agency”—informed by the imagined affordances of emerging technology—is required to really understand the collapse of Tay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Neff","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Nagy","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"neffAutomationAlgorithmsPolitics2016","container-title":"International Journal of Communication","ISSN":"1932-8036","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,12]]},"language":"en","license":"The  International Journal of Communication  is an academic journal.

  {"id":"ngaiOurAestheticCategories2015","abstract":"The zany, the cute, and the interesting saturate postmodern culture. They dominate the look of its art and commodities as well as our discourse about the ambivalent feelings these objects often inspire. In this radiant study, Sianne Ngai offers a theory of the aesthetic categories that most people use to process the hypercommodified, mass-mediated, performance-driven world of late capitalism, treating them with the same seriousness philosophers have reserved for analysis of the beautiful and the sublime.Ngai explores how each of these aesthetic categories expresses conflicting feelings that connect to the ways in which postmodern subjects work, exchange, and consume. As a style of performing that takes the form of affective labor, the zany is bound up with production and engages our playfulness and our sense of desperation. The interesting is tied to the circulation of discourse and inspires interest but also boredom. The cute's involvement with consumption brings out feelings of tenderness and aggression simultaneously. At the deepest level, Ngai argues, these equivocal categories are about our complex relationship to performing, information, and commodities.Through readings of Adorno, Schlegel, and Nietzsche alongside cultural artifacts ranging from Bob Perelman's poetry to Ed Ruscha's photography books to the situation comedy of Lucille Ball, Ngai shows how these everyday aesthetic categories also provide traction to classic problems in aesthetic theory. The zany, cute, and interesting are not postmodernity's only meaningful aesthetic categories, Ngai argues, but the ones best suited for grasping the radical transformation of aesthetic experience and discourse under its conditions.","author":[{"family":"Ngai","given":"Sianne"}],"citation-key":"ngaiOurAestheticCategories2015","edition":"Reprint edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts London, England","ISBN":"978-0-674-08812-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,5]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"344","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts London, England","source":"Amazon","title":"Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting","title-short":"Our Aesthetic Categories","type":"book"},

  {"id":"nimkulratHandsonIntellectIntegrating2012","abstract":"Over the last two decades, craft practice has played a considerable role in practice-led design research, especially as the subject and the vehicle for theoretical inquiry. This article aims to reveal how craft as a way of thinking through material can be incorporated into practice-led design research. The author's completed dissertation exploring the expressivity of materials in textiles is used to demonstrate how craft can drive a practice-led research process and how research can enhance craft practice. The dissertation exemplifies how the author employed her own craft practice as the main method for design research. The method was utilized in relation to Merleau-Ponty's and Heidegger's phenomenology and the method of questioning viewers during two exhibitions featuring artifacts resulting from the author's craft practice. Positioning craft practice in a research context can facilitate the reflection and articulation of knowledge generated from within the researcher-practitioner's artistic experience, so that the knowledge becomes explicit as a written text or as a means of visual representation. Research can not only transform ways of designing or making artifacts, but also theoretically inform practice so that the practice can develop the practitioner's aesthetic intelligence, the results of which are craft objects that can be understood more easily by viewers.

  {"id":"nimkulratMaterialInspirationPracticeled2010","abstract":"Craft art discourse has centred on the use of physical materials. In Finland, craft art students are trained to understand various techniques and the materiality of their chosen medium. However, the materiality is often taught in terms of physical properties (e.g. tensile, elasticity, etc.). Conceptual or expressive properties (e.g. feel, impression, etc.) are hardly discussed and it is left to students to experiment with these properties in their studio practice. The conceptual issues of craft art practice concerning the use of materials thus remain personal and implicit. This article illuminates how the conception of materialness generated from within practice-led research in textile art can stimulate students&apos; creativity in relation to physical materials and enable them to design the meaning and aesthetic of their work more intentionally. The consideration of materialness can thus serve as a useful means for textile artists and other craft artists in creating meaningful artworks with any chosen materials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Nimkulrat","given":"Nithikul"}],"citation-key":"nimkulratMaterialInspirationPracticeled2010","container-title":"Craft Research","DOI":"10.1386/crre.1.63_1","ISSN":"2040-4689, 2040-4697","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"63-84","publisher":"Intellect","source":"intellectdiscover.com","title":"Material inspiration: From practice-led research to craft art education","title-short":"Material inspiration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/crre.1.63_1","volume":"1"},

But, if you type in �white girls,� the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about �why black women are so sassy� or �why black women are so angry� presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society. In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance�operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond�understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance. An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.","author":[{"family":"Noble","given":"Safiya Umoja"}],"citation-key":"nobleAlgorithmsOppressionHow2018","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4798-4994-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Algorithms of Oppression : How Search Engines Reinforce Racism","type":"book","URL":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1497317&authtype=sso&custid=s8983984"},

The language metaphor entered modern computing as part of a cybernetic discourse, but during the second half of the 1950s acquired a more abstract meaning, closely related to the formal languages of logic and linguistics. The article argues that this transformation was related to the appearance of the commercial computer in the mid-1950s. Managers of computing installations and specialists on computer programming in academic computer centers, confronted with an increasing variety of machines, called for the creation of “common” or “universal languages” to enable the migration of computer code from machine to machine. Finally, the article shows how the idea of a universal language was a decisive step in the emergence of programming languages, in the recognition of computer programming as a proper field of knowledge, and eventually in the way we think of the computer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Nofre","given":"David"},{"family":"Priestley","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Alberts","given":"Gerard"}],"citation-key":"nofreWhenTechnologyBecame2014","container-title":"Technology and Culture","DOI":"10.1353/tech.2014.0031","ISSN":"1097-3729","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,7]]},"language":"en","page":"40-75","publisher":"Johns Hopkins University Press","source":"Project MUSE","title":"When Technology Became Language: The Origins of the Linguistic Conception of Computer Programming, 1950–1960","title-short":"When Technology Became Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/article/538908","volume":"55"},

  {"id":"oakesAuthorProfilingRelated2022","abstract":"Author profiling is the analysis of people’s writing in an attempt to find out which classes they belong to, such as gender, age group or native language. Many of the techniques for author profiling are derived from the related task of Author Identification, so we will look at this topic first. Author identification is the task of finding out who is most likely to have written a disputed document, and there are a number of computational approaches to this. The three main subtasks are the compilation of corpora of texts known to be written by the candidate authors, the selection of linguistic features to represent those texts, and statistics for discriminating between those features which are most indicative of a particular author’s writing style. Plagiarism is the unacknowledged use of another author’s original work, and we will look at software for its detection. The chapter will cover the types of text obfuscation strategies used by plagiarists, commercial plagiarism detection software and its shortcomings, and recent research systems. Strategies have been developed for both external plagiarism detection (where the original source is searched for in a large document collection) and intrinsic plagiarism detection (where the source text is not available, necessitating a search for inconsistencies within the suspicious document). The specific problems of plagiarism by translation of an original in another language, and the unauthorized copying of sections of computer code, are described. Evaluation forums and publicly available test data sets are covered for each of the main topics of this chapter.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Oakes","given":"Michael P."}],"citation-key":"oakesAuthorProfilingRelated2022","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.53","editor":[{"family":"Mitkov","given":"Ruslan"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-957369-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"page":"0","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Silverchair","title":"Author Profiling and Related Applications","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.53"},

  {"id":"oatesRunningFemaleUsing2019","abstract":"While there is conclusive research that female political candidates are treated unfairly by traditional media outlets, the volume and pace of information flow online make it difficult to track the differentiated treatment for female candidates on social media in real time. This paper leverages human coding and natural language processing to cluster tweets into narratives concerned with policy, ideology, character, identity, and electability, focusing on the Democratic candidates in the 2020 U.S. Presidential primary election. We find that female candidates are frequently marginalized and attacked on character and identity issues that are not raised for their male counterparts, echoing the problems found in the traditional media in the framing of female candidates. Our research found a Catch-22 for female candidates, in that they either failed to garner serious attention at all or, if they became a subject of Twitter commentary, were attacked on issues of character and identity that were not raised for their male counterparts. At the same time, women running for president received significantly more negative tweets from right-leaning and non-credible sources than did male candidates. Following the first Democratic debates, the individual differences between male and female candidates became even more pronounced, although at least one female candidate (Elizabeth Warren) seemed to rise above the character attacks by the end of the first debates. We propose that by using artificial intelligence informed by traditional political communication theory, we can much more readily identify and challenge both sexist comments and coverage at scale. We use the concept of narratives by searching for political communication narratives about female candidates that are visible, enduring, resonant, and relevant to particular campaign messages. A real-time measurement system, developed by MarvelousAI, creates a way to allow candidates to identify and push back against sexist framing on social media and take control of their own narratives much more readily.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Oates","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Gurevich","given":"Olya"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Di Meco","given":"Lucina"}],"citation-key":"oatesRunningFemaleUsing2019","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,28]]},"language":"en","number":"ID 3444200","publisher":"Social Science Research Network","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"papers.ssrn.com","title":"Running While Female: Using AI to Track how Twitter Commentary Disadvantages Women in the 2020 U.S. Primaries","title-short":"Running While Female","type":"report","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3444200"},

We focus on DALL-E 2 and related models as an emergent approach to image-making that operates through the cultural techniques of feature extraction and semantic compression. These techniques, we argue, are inhuman, invisual, and opaque, yet are still caught in a paradox that is ironically all too human: the consistent reproduction of whiteness as a latent feature of dominant visual culture. We use Open AI's failed efforts to 'debias' their system as a critical opening to interrogate how systems like DALL-E 2 dissolve and reconstitute politically salient human concepts like race. This example vividly illustrates the stakes of this moment of transformation, when so-called foundation models reconfigure the boundaries of visual culture and when 'doing' anti-racism means deploying quick technical fixes to mitigate personal discomfort, or more importantly, potential commercial loss.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Offert","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Phan","given":"Thao"}],"citation-key":"offertSignThatSpells2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,26]]},"number":"arXiv:2211.06323","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Sign That Spells: DALL-E 2, Invisual Images and The Racial Politics of Feature Space","title-short":"A Sign That Spells","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06323"},

This article demonstrates that nineteenth-century clinicians drew upon the sphygmograph to authorise doctorly touch as newly ‘proper’ within a changed technological context. By contrast, an analysis of the place of error within the Apple Watch’s photoplethysmograph demonstrates how contemporary self-quantifiers are encumbered with an unreliable measuring apparatus which can only generalise a form of ‘improper’ touch, touch which fails to know the body and which remains tied to a ‘proper’ touch which lies elsewhere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"O’Neill","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"oneillHapticMediaCultural2017","container-title":"New Media & Society","container-title-short":"New Media & Society","DOI":"10.1177/1461444817717514","ISSN":"1461-4448","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1615-1631","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Haptic media and the cultural techniques of touch: The sphygmograph, photoplethysmography and the Apple Watch","title-short":"Haptic media and the cultural techniques of touch","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817717514","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"oppyTuringTest2021","abstract":"The phrase “The Turing Test” is most properly used torefer to a proposal made by Turing (1950) as a way of dealing with thequestion whether machines can think. According to Turing, the questionwhether machines can think is itself “too meaningless” todeserve discussion (442). However, if we consider the moreprecise—and somehow related—question whether a digitalcomputer can do well in a certain kind of game that Turing describes(“The Imitation Game”), then—at least inTuring’s eyes—we do have a question that admits of precisediscussion. Moreover, as we shall see, Turing himself thought that itwould not be too long before we did have digital computers that could“do well” in the Imitation Game., The phrase “The Turing Test” is sometimes used moregenerally to refer to some kinds of behavioural tests for the presenceof mind, or thought, or intelligence in putatively minded entities.So, for example, it is sometimes suggested that The Turing Test isprefigured in Descartes’ Discourse on the Method.(Copeland (2000:527) finds an anticipation of the test in the 1668writings of the Cartesian de Cordemoy. Abramson (2011a) presentsarchival evidence that Turing was aware of Descartes’ languagetest at the time that he wrote his 1950 paper. Gunderson (1964)provides an early instance of those who find that Turing’s workis foreshadowed in the work of Descartes.), The phrase “The Turing Test” is also sometimes used torefer to certain kinds of purely behavioural allegedly logicallysufficient conditions for the presence of mind, or thought, orintelligence, in putatively minded entities. So, for example, NedBlock’s “Blockhead” thought experiment is often saidto be a (putative) knockdown objection to The Turing Test. (Block(1981) contains a direct discussion of The Turing Test in thiscontext.) Here, what a proponent of this view has in mind is the ideathat it is logically possible for an entity to pass the kindsof tests that Descartes and (at least allegedly) Turing have inmind—to use words (and, perhaps, to act) in just the kind of waythat human beings do—and yet to be entirely lacking inintelligence, not possessed of a mind, etc., The subsequent discussion takes up the preceding ideas in the order inwhich they have been introduced. First, there is a discussion ofTuring’s paper (1950), and of the arguments contained therein.Second, there is a discussion of current assessments of variousproposals that have been called “The Turing Test” (whetheror not there is much merit in the application of this label to theproposals in question). Third, there is a brief discussion of somerecent writings on The Turing Test, including some discussion of thequestion whether The Turing Test sets an appropriate goal for researchinto artificial intelligence. Finally, there is a very shortdiscussion of Searle’s Chinese Room argument, and, inparticular, of the bearing of this argument on The Turing Test., For other introductory discussions of the Turing Test, from a range ofperspectives, see, for example: Copeland (2000), Damassino and Novelli(2020), French (2000), Korukonda (2003), Moor (2008), Neufeld andFinnestad (2020a) (2020b), Proudfoot and Copeland (2008), Saygin etal. (2000), and Shieber (2004). For further information about Turinghimself, see, for example: Cooper and van Leeuwen (2013), Copeland etal.

  {"id":"orasanRecentDevelopmentsNatural2022","abstract":"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a dynamic and rapidly developing field in which new trends, techniques, and applications are constantly emerging. This chapter focuses mainly on recent developments in NLP which could not be covered in other chapters of the Handbook. Topics such as crowdsourcing and processing of large datasets, which are no longer that recent but are widely used and not covered at length in any other chapter, are also presented. The chapter starts by describing how the availability of tools and resources has had a positive impact on the field. The proliferation of user-generated content has led to the emergence of research topics such as sarcasm and irony detection, automatic assessment of user-generated content, and stance detection. All of these topics are discussed in the chapter. The field of NLP is approaching maturity, a fact corroborated by the latest developments in the processing of texts for financial purposes and for helping users with disabilities, two topics that are also discussed here. The chapter presents examples of how researchers have successfully combined research in computer vision and natural language processing to enable the processing of multimodal information, as well as how the latest advances in deep learning have revitalized research on chatbots and conversational agents. The chapter concludes with a comprehensive list of further reading material and additional resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Orăsan","given":"Constantin"},{"family":"Mitkov","given":"Ruslan"}],"citation-key":"orasanRecentDevelopmentsNatural2022","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Computational Linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.005","editor":[{"family":"Mitkov","given":"Ruslan"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-957369-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"page":"0","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"Silverchair","title":"Recent Developments in Natural Language Processing","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199573691.013.005"},

Drawing on a corpus of interviews with dataset creators, we uncover the messy and contingent realities of dataset preparation. We identify four key challenges in constructing datasets, including balancing the benefits and costs of increasing dataset scale, limited access to resources, a reliance on shortcuts for compiling datasets and evaluating their quality, and ambivalence regarding accountability for a dataset. These themes illustrate the ways in which datasets are not objective or neutral, but reflect the personal judgments and trade-offs of their creators within wider institutional dynamics, working within social, technical, and organizational constraints. We underscore the importance of examining the processes of dataset creation to strengthen an understanding of responsible practices for dataset development and care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Orr","given":"Will"},{"family":"Crawford","given":"Kate"}],"citation-key":"orrSocialConstructionDatasets2023","DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/8c9uh","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"language":"en-us","publisher":"SocArXiv","source":"OSF Preprints","title":"The social construction of datasets: On the practices, processes and challenges of dataset creation for machine learning","title-short":"The social construction of datasets","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8c9uh/"},

  {"id":"ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022","abstract":"Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Long"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Diogo"},{"family":"Wainwright","given":"Carroll L."},{"family":"Mishkin","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chong"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sandhini"},{"family":"Slama","given":"Katarina"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Schulman","given":"John"},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Kelton","given":"Fraser"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Simens","given":"Maddie"},{"family":"Askell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Welinder","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Christiano","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Leike","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Ryan"}],"citation-key":"ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2203.02155","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"number":"arXiv:2203.02155","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155"},

Given AI fairness' raison d'\\^etre of ``fairness,'' we argue that adopting intersectionality as an analytical framework is pivotal to effectively operationalizing fairness. Through a critical review of how intersectionality is discussed in 30 papers from the AI fairness literature, we deductively and inductively: 1) map how intersectionality tenets operate within the AI fairness paradigm and 2) uncover gaps between the conceptualization and operationalization of intersectionality. We find that researchers overwhelmingly reduce intersectionality to optimizing for fairness metrics over demographic subgroups. They also fail to discuss their social context and when mentioning power, they mostly situate it only within the AI pipeline. We: 3) outline and assess the implications of these gaps for critical inquiry and praxis, and 4) provide actionable recommendations for AI fairness researchers to engage with intersectionality in their work by grounding it in AI epistemology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ovalle","given":"Anaelia"},{"family":"Subramonian","given":"Arjun"},{"family":"Gautam","given":"Vagrant"},{"family":"Gee","given":"Gilbert"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kai-Wei"}],"citation-key":"ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.17555","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"number":"arXiv:2303.17555","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Factoring the Matrix of Domination: A Critical Review and Reimagination of Intersectionality in AI Fairness","title-short":"Factoring the Matrix of Domination","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17555"},
  {"id":"ovalleFullyWhoAm2023","abstract":"Transgender and non-binary (TGNB) individuals disproportionately experience discrimination and exclusion from daily life. Given the recent popularity and adoption of language generation technologies, the potential to further marginalize this population only grows. Although a multitude of NLP fairness literature focuses on illuminating and addressing gender biases, assessing gender harms for TGNB identities requires understanding how such identities uniquely interact with societal gender norms and how they differ from gender binary-centric perspectives. Such measurement frameworks inherently require centering TGNB voices to help guide the alignment between gender-inclusive NLP and whom they are intended to serve. Towards this goal, we ground our work in the TGNB community and existing interdisciplinary literature to assess how the social reality surrounding experienced marginalization of TGNB persons contributes to and persists within Open Language Generation (OLG). This social knowledge serves as a guide for evaluating popular large language models (LLMs) on two key aspects: (1) misgendering and (2) harmful responses to gender disclosure. To do this, we introduce TANGO, a dataset of template-based real-world text curated from a TGNB-oriented community. We discover a dominance of binary gender norms reflected by the models; LLMs least misgendered subjects in generated text when triggered by prompts whose subjects used binary pronouns. Meanwhile, misgendering was most prevalent when triggering generation with singular they and neopronouns. When prompted with gender disclosures, TGNB disclosure generated the most stigmatizing language and scored most toxic, on average. Our findings warrant further research on how TGNB harms manifest in LLMs and serve as a broader case study toward concretely grounding the design of gender-inclusive AI in community voices and interdisciplinary literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ovalle","given":"Anaelia"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"Palash"},{"family":"Dhamala","given":"Jwala"},{"family":"Jaggers","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Kai-Wei"},{"family":"Galstyan","given":"Aram"},{"family":"Zemel","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Rahul"}],"citation-key":"ovalleFullyWhoAm2023","container-title":"2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3593013.3594078","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1246-1266","source":"arXiv.org","title":"\"I'm fully who I am\": Towards Centering Transgender and Non-Binary Voices to Measure Biases in Open Language Generation","title-short":"I'm fully who I am","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09941"},

One approach to designing fair algorithms is to use relaxations of fairness notions as regularization terms or in a constrained optimization problem. We observe that the hyperbolic tangent function can approximate the indicator function. We leverage this property to define a differentiable relaxation that approximates fairness notions provably better than existing relaxations. In addition, we propose a model-agnostic multi-objective architecture that can simultaneously optimize for multiple fairness notions and multiple sensitive attributes and supports all statistical parity-based notions of fairness. We use our relaxation with the multi-objective architecture to learn fair classifiers.

  {"id":"paikWeAreOpen2019","abstract":"\"Nam June Paik (1932-2006) is a pivotal figure in the history of modern art. Arguably the most important video artist of all time, and certainly among the most influential and prolific, Paik was a legendary innovator who transformed the electronic moving image into an artist's medium. He wrote incessantly--corresponding with friends, composing performance scores, making production notes for television projects, drafting plans for video installations, writing essays and articles. Celebrated for his visionary development of new artistic tools and for his pioneering work in video and television, Paik often wrote to sharpen his thinking and hone his ideas. He used the typewriter to fashion sentences that broke apart and reassembled themselves as he wrote, producing both poetic texts and aesthetic objects on the page. This first extensive collection of Paik's writings includes many previously unpublished and out-of-print texts. Drawing on materials from the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Nam June Paik Archive and from a range of international publications, We Are in Open Circuits offers important but long-unavailable essays, including \"Global Groove and Video Common Market\"; unpublished writings on such topics as his creative partnership with the cellist Charlotte Moorman and the role of public television; a substantial part of his compilation \"Scrutable Chinese\"; and detailed plans for some of his groundbreaking broadcast works, including the trio Good Morning, Mr. Orwell (1984), Bye Bye Kipling (1986), and Wrap Around the World (1988). It also includes nearly 150 pages that reproduce Paik's original typed and handwritten pages, letting readers see his writing in various stages of inspiration and execution.\"--Publisher's description","author":[{"family":"Paik","given":"Nam-June"},{"family":"Hanhardt","given":"John G."},{"family":"Zinman","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Decker-Philipps","given":"Edith"}],"call-number":"777.092","citation-key":"paikWeAreOpen2019","collection-title":"Writing art series","event-place":"Cambridge, [Massachusetts]","ISBN":"978-0-262-03980-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, [Massachusetts]","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"We are in open circuits: writings by Nam June Paik","title-short":"We are in open circuits","type":"book"},

  {"id":"parisiAlienSubjectAI2019","abstract":"Immersed in the networks of artificial intelligences that are constantly learning from each other, the subject today is being configured by the automated architecture of a computational sovereignty (Bratton 2015). All levels of decision-making are harnessed in given sets of probabilities where the individuality of the subject is broken into endlessly divisable digits. These are specifically re-assembled at check points (Deleuze in Negotiations: 1972–1990, Columbia University Press, New York, 1995), in ever growing actions of predictive data (Cheney-Lippold in We are data and the making of our digital selves, NYU Press, New York, 2017), where consciousness is replaced by mindless computations (Daston in “The rule of rules”, lecture Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin, November 21st, 2010). As a result of the automation of cognition, the subject has thus become ultimately deprived of the transcendental tool of reason. This article discusses the consequences of this crisis of conscious cognition by the hands of machines by asking whether the servo-mechanic model of technology can be overturned to expose the alien subject of artificial intelligence as a mode of thinking originating at, but also beyond, the transcendental schema of the self-determining subject. As much as the socio-affective qualities of the user have become the primary sources of capital abstraction, value, quantification and governmental control, so has technology, as the means of abstraction, itself changed nature. This article will suggest that the cybernetic network of communication has not only absorbed physical and cognitive labour into its circuits of reproduction, but is, more importantly, learning from human culture, through the data analysis of behaviours, the contextual use of content and the sourcing of knowledge. The theorisation of machine learning as involving a process of thinking will be taken here as a fundamental inspiration to argue that the expansion of an alien space of reasoning, envisioning the possibility of machine thinking against the servo-mechanic model of cybernetics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Parisi","given":"Luciana"}],"citation-key":"parisiAlienSubjectAI2019","container-title":"Subjectivity","container-title-short":"Subjectivity","DOI":"10.1057/s41286-018-00064-3","ISSN":"1755-635X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"27-48","source":"Springer Link","title":"The alien subject of AI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41286-018-00064-3","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"parisiCriticalComputationDigital2019","abstract":"As machines have become increasingly smart and have entangled human thinking with artificial intelligences, it seems no longer possible to distinguish among levels of decision-making that occur in the newly formed space between critical reasoning, logical inference and sheer calculation. Since the 1980s, computational systems of information processing have evolved to include not only deductive methods of decision, whereby results are already implicated in their premises, but have crucially shifted towards an adaptive practice of learning from data, an inductive method of retrieving information from the environment and establishing general premises. This shift in logical methods of decision-making does not simply concern technical apparatuses, but is a symptom of a transformation in logical thinking activated with and through machines. This article discusses the pioneering work of Katherine Hayles, whose study of the cybernetic and computational infrastructures of our culture particularly clarifies this epistemological transformation of thinking in relation to machines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Parisi","given":"Luciana"}],"citation-key":"parisiCriticalComputationDigital2019","container-title":"Theory, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Theory, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0263276418818889","ISSN":"0263-2764","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"89-121","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Critical Computation: Digital Automata and General Artificial Thinking","title-short":"Critical Computation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0263276418818889","volume":"36"},

It is not possible to address this question without first reflecting on how the Universal Turing Machine transformed symbolic logic and brought to a halt the universality of mathematical formalism and the biocentric speciation of thought. The article draws on Sylvia Wynter’s discussion of the sociogenic principle to argue that both neurocognitive and formal models of automated cognition constitute the epistemological explanations of the origin of the human and of human sapience. Wynter’s argument will be related to Gilbert Simondon’s reflections on ‘technical mentality’ to consider how socio-techno-genic assemblages can challenge the biocentricism and the formalism of modern epistemology. This article turns to ludic logic as one possible example of techno-semiotic languages as a speculative overturning of sociogenic programming.

  {"id":"parisiRecursivePhilosophyNegative2022","abstract":"What has philosophy become after computation? Critical positions about what counts as intelligence, reason, and thinking have addressed this question by reenvisioning and pushing debates about the modern question of technology towards new radical visions. Artificial intelligence, it is argued, is replacing transcendental metaphysics with aggregates of data resulting in predictive modes of decision-making, replacing conceptual reflection with probabilities. This article discusses two main positions. While on the one hand, it is feared that philosophy has been replaced by cybernetic metaphysics, on the other hand it is claimed that only the coconstitution of philosophy and automation challenges modern transcendental reason and colonial capital. As Donna Haraway pointed out, cybernetic circuits of communication have constructed counterfactual ontologies against the master narrative of the human. This article addresses recent attempts at redeveloping a critique of natural philosophy that explains cybernetic metaphysics beyond the universal master narratives of mechanicism and vitalism. This article suggests that the recursive system of nature and technology also needs to account for the problem of philosophical decision, which will be explored in terms of mediatic thinking, instrumentality, and automation. This article follows insights from the movie Get Out (2017) to argue that the model of philosophical decision relies on a servomechanic understanding of the medium of thought, based on the colonial abstraction of value in the prosthetic extension of the slave-machine. It explores the nonphilosophical envisioning of automation in terms of a counterfactual theorisation of the negative negation of the medium and argues for a nonoptical darkness entering the space of thinking. Philosophy and automation are neither coupled nor set in opposition as if in a ceaseless mirroring. Instead, both philosophy and automation must transform their self-determining axiomatics in order to host the heretic activities of machine propositions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Parisi","given":"Luciana"}],"citation-key":"parisiRecursivePhilosophyNegative2022","container-title":"Critical Inquiry","DOI":"10.1086/717323","ISSN":"0093-1896","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"page":"313-333","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"www-journals-uchicago-edu.libproxy2.usc.edu (Atypon)","title":"Recursive Philosophy and Negative Machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/717323","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"pattersonCarbonEmissionsLarge","abstract":"The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models—T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3—and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): ● Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume <1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. ● Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. ● Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be ~1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be ~2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.","author":[{"family":"Patterson","given":"David"},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Munguia","given":"Lluis-Miquel"},{"family":"Rothchild","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"So","given":"David"},{"family":"Texier","given":"Maud"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"pattersonCarbonEmissionsLarge","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Carbon Emissions and Large Neural Network Training","type":"article-journal"},

In this paper, we survey the many concerns raised about the way we collect and use data in machine learning and advocate that a more cautious and thorough understanding of data is necessary to address several of the practical and ethical issues of the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Paullada","given":"Amandalynne"},{"family":"Raji","given":"Inioluwa Deborah"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Emily M."},{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"}],"citation-key":"paulladaDataItsDis2021","container-title":"Patterns","container-title-short":"Patterns","DOI":"10.1016/j.patter.2021.100336","ISSN":"26663899","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"page":"100336","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Data and its (dis)contents: A survey of dataset development and use in machine learning research","title-short":"Data and its (dis)contents","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05345","volume":"2"},

In response, the machine learning community has called for higher ethical standards in dataset creation. To help inform these efforts, we studied three influential but ethically problematic face and person recognition datasets -- Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), MS-Celeb-1M, and DukeMTM -- by analyzing nearly 1000 papers that cite them. We found that the creation of derivative datasets and models, broader technological and social change, the lack of clarity of licenses, and dataset management practices can introduce a wide range of ethical concerns. We conclude by suggesting a distributed approach to harm mitigation that considers the entire life cycle of a dataset.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Kenny"},{"family":"Mathur","given":"Arunesh"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Arvind"}],"citation-key":"pengMitigatingDatasetHarms2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2108.02922","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,21]]},"number":"arXiv:2108.02922","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Mitigating Dataset Harms Requires Stewardship: Lessons from 1000 Papers","title-short":"Mitigating Dataset Harms Requires Stewardship","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02922"},

It plays a central role in human consciousness at the interplay of language and thought. An impressive host of research works has been carried out on inner speech these last fifty years. Here we first describe the phenomenology of inner speech by examining five issues: common behavioural and cerebral correlates with overt speech, different types of inner speech (wilful verbal thought generation and verbal mind wandering), presence of inner speech in reading and in writing, inner signing and voice-hallucinations in deaf people. Secondly, we review the role of inner speech in cognitive performance (i.e. enhancement vs. perturbation). Finally, we consider agency in inner speech and how our inner voice is known to be self-generated and not produced by someone else.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Perrone-Bertolotti","given":"M."},{"family":"Rapin","given":"L."},{"family":"Lachaux","given":"J. -P."},{"family":"Baciu","given":"M."},{"family":"Lœvenbruck","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"perrone-bertolottiWhatThatLittle2014","container-title":"Behavioural Brain Research","container-title-short":"Behavioural Brain Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbr.2013.12.034","ISSN":"0166-4328","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"220-239","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"What is that little voice inside my head?

  {"id":"pestianSuicideNoteClassification2010","abstract":"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 25–34 year olds and the third leading cause of death among 15–25 year olds in the United States. In the Emergency Department, where suicidal patients often present, estimating the risk of repeated attempts is generally left to clinical judgment. This paper presents our second attempt to determine the role of computational algorithms in understanding a suicidal patient's thoughts, as represented by suicide notes. We focus on developing methods of natural language processing that distinguish between genuine and elicited suicide notes. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can categorize suicide notes as well as mental health professionals and psychiatric physician trainees do. The data used are comprised of suicide notes from 33 suicide completers and matched to 33 elicited notes from healthy control group members. Eleven mental health professionals and 31 psychiatric trainees were asked to decide if a note was genuine or elicited. Their decisions were compared to nine different machine-learning algorithms. The results indicate that trainees accurately classified notes 49% of the time, mental health professionals accurately classified notes 63% of the time, and the best machine learning algorithm accurately classified the notes 78% of the time. This is an important step in developing an evidence-based predictor of repeated suicide attempts because it shows that natural language processing can aid in distinguishing between classes of suicidal notes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Pestian","given":"John"},{"family":"Nasrallah","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Matykiewicz","given":"Pawel"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"Aurora"},{"family":"Leenaars","given":"Antoon"}],"citation-key":"pestianSuicideNoteClassification2010","container-title":"Biomedical Informatics Insights","container-title-short":"Biomed Inform Insights","DOI":"10.4137/BII.S4706","ISSN":"1178-2226","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"BII.S4706","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Suicide Note Classification Using Natural Language Processing: A Content Analysis","title-short":"Suicide Note Classification Using Natural Language Processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.4137/BII.S4706","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"phangAdversariallyConstructedEvaluation2021","abstract":"More capable language models increasingly saturate existing task benchmarks, in some cases outperforming humans. This has left little headroom with which to measure further progress. Adversarial dataset creation has been proposed as a strategy to construct more challenging datasets, and two common approaches are: (1) filtering out easy examples and (2) model-in-the-loop data collection. In this work, we study the impact of applying each approach to create more challenging evaluation datasets. We adapt the AFLite algorithm to filter evaluation data, and run experiments against 18 different adversary models. We find that AFLite indeed selects more challenging examples, lowering the performance of evaluated models more as stronger adversary models are used. However, the resulting ranking of models can also be unstable and highly sensitive to the choice of adversary model used. Moreover, AFLite oversamples examples with low annotator agreement, meaning that model comparisons hinge on the most contentiously labeled examples. Smaller-scale experiments on the adversarially collected datasets ANLI and AdversarialQA show similar findings, broadly lowering performance with stronger adversaries while disproportionately affecting the adversary model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Phang","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Angelica"},{"family":"Huang","given":"William"},{"family":"Bowman","given":"Samuel R."}],"citation-key":"phangAdversariallyConstructedEvaluation2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"number":"arXiv:2111.08181","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Adversarially Constructed Evaluation Sets Are More Challenging, but May Not Be Fair","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08181"},

We ask annotators to describe an image with their voice while simultaneously hovering their mouse over the region they are describing.

This dense visual grounding takes the form of a mouse trace segment per word and is unique to our data. We annotated 849k images with Localized Narratives: the whole COCO, Flickr30k, and ADE20K datasets, and 671k images of Open Images, all of which we make publicly available.

As evidenced by any number of scenes of what might be called data montage—think of the reference library sleuthing in Spotlight (2015) or the now-iconic scrolling green type in The Matrix (1999)—we struggle to picture data, let alone begin to analyze it as a media object. Even in information studies and data science, fields in which data is a primary object of study, specific definitions of the term are contested and often unsatisfying. Does information become data when it is converted from undifferentiated content to structured form? When it is translated from text or image into machine-readable form? Or when marshalled as evidence or proof of results?\n\nThe information scholar Christine Borgman has argued for the contingent and time-based nature of data: information becomes data not by virtue of any inherent property, but in the process of being transformed for use as evidence in support of a claim.1 The historian Daniel Rosenberg takes this line of argument further. Data, he contends, is “ specifically rhetorical”—the necessary prerequisite to any analysis or claim.2 These formulations of data are helpful, but to the media scholar, they omit some important features. We may select and arrange a series of sequences from a film or television show in support of an argument, but we almost never refer to this evidence as “data”—a fact that suggests that, …","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Posner","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Lauren F."}],"citation-key":"posnerEditorIntroductionData2017","container-title":"Feminist Media Histories","container-title-short":"Fem Media Hist","DOI":"10.1525/fmh.2017.3.3.1","ISSN":"2373-7492","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 by the Regents of the University of California.

We then use the census to help hand-curate a look-up-table of images in the ImageNet-ILSVRC-2012 dataset that fall into the categories of verifiably pornographic: shot in a non-consensual setting (up-skirt), beach voyeuristic, and exposed private parts. We survey the landscape of harm and threats both society broadly and individuals face due to uncritical and ill-considered dataset curation practices. We then propose possible courses of correction and critique the pros and cons of these.

Seeking to overthrow all constraints on what can be done with and to the body, Paul B. Preciado offers a provocative challenge to even the most radical claims about gender, sexuality, and desire.Preciado lays out mock constitutional principles for a countersexual revolution that will recognize genitalia as technological objects and offers step-by-step illustrated instructions for dismantling the heterocentric social contract. He calls theorists such as Derrida, Foucault, Butler, and Haraway to task for not going nearly far enough in their attempts to deconstruct the naturalization of normative identities and behaviors. Preciado's claim that the dildo precedes the penis-that artifice, not nature, comes first in the history of sexuality-forms the basis of his demand for new practices of sexual emancipation. He calls for a world of sexual plasticity and fabrication, of bio-printers and \"dildonics,\" and he invokes countersexuality's roots in the history of sex toys, pornography, and drag in order to rupture the supposedly biological foundations of the heterocentric regime. His claims are extreme, but supported through meticulous readings of philosophy and theory, as well as popular culture. The <i>Manifesto</i> is now available in English translation for its twentieth anniversary, with a new introduction by Preciado. <i>Countersexual Manifesto</i> will disrupt feminism and queer theory and scandalize us all with its hyperbolic but deadly serious defiance of everything we've been told about sex.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,25]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"PRECIADO","given":"PAUL B."},{"family":"DUNN","given":"KEVIN GERRY"}],"citation-key":"preciadoCountersexualManifesto2018","ISBN":"978-0-231-17562-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Countersexual Manifesto","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/prec17562"},

  {"id":"premEthicalAIFrameworks2023","abstract":"In reaction to concerns about a broad range of potential ethical issues, dozens of proposals for addressing ethical aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) have been published. However, many of them are too abstract for being easily translated into concrete designs for AI systems. The various proposed ethical frameworks can be considered an instance of principlism that is similar to that found in medical ethics. Given their general nature, principles do not say how they should be applied in a particular context. Hence, a broad range of approaches, methods, and tools have been proposed for addressing ethical concerns of AI systems. This paper presents a systematic analysis of more than 100 frameworks, process models, and proposed remedies and tools for helping to make the necessary shift from principles to implementation, expanding on the work of Morley and colleagues. This analysis confirms a strong focus of proposed approaches on only a few ethical issues such as explicability, fairness, privacy, and accountability. These issues are often addressed with proposals for software and algorithms. Other, more general ethical issues are mainly addressed with conceptual frameworks, guidelines, or process models. This paper develops a structured list and definitions of approaches, presents a refined segmentation of the AI development process, and suggests areas that will require more attention from researchers and developers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Prem","given":"Erich"}],"citation-key":"premEthicalAIFrameworks2023","container-title":"AI and Ethics","container-title-short":"AI Ethics","DOI":"10.1007/s43681-023-00258-9","ISSN":"2730-5961","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"3","page":"699-716","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","source":"rd.springer.com","title":"From ethical AI frameworks to tools: a review of approaches","title-short":"From ethical AI frameworks to tools","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-023-00258-9","volume":"3"},

The authors present the first coherent, overarching theory that connects dynamical explanations of action and perception with language. Arguing from the assumption of a deep continuity between life and mind, they show that this continuity extends to language. Expanding and deepening enactive theory, they offer a constitutive account of language and the co-emergent phenomena of personhood, reflexivity, social normativity, and ideality. Language, they argue, is not something we add to a range of existing cognitive capacities but a new way of being embodied. Each of us is a linguistic body in a community of other linguistic bodies. The book describes three distinct yet entangled kinds of human embodiment, organic, sensorimotor, and intersubjective; it traces the emergence of linguistic sensitivities and introduces the novel concept of linguistic bodies; and it explores the implications of living as linguistic bodies in perpetual becoming, applying the concept of linguistic bodies to questions of language acquisition, parenting, autism, grammar, symbol, narrative, and gesture, and to such ethical concerns as microaggression, institutional speech, and pedagogy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Press","given":"The MIT"}],"citation-key":"pressLinguisticBodies","container-title":"The MIT Press","language":"en","title":"Linguistic Bodies","type":"webpage","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/linguistic-bodies"},

With the advent of ubiquitous computing, the self becomes an object of technological application, increasingly defined by data received from tracking technologies. Subtly, these technologies encourage versions of ourselves that are easier to interpret computationally. Fedorova views these shifts in self-perception through the lens of contemporary media art practices, examining a range of artistic tactics that enable embodied and intimate experiences of machinic operations on our lives.At the center of Fedorova's analysis are the mechanisms that structure the relations between the self and the world at the level of the interface; she considers “interfacing” a process in which interrelation happens and different agencies play off against each other. She discusses such topics as interfaciality and the face as a medium; self-image and the boundaries of the self, understood through technological mediation of an embodied experience; the relation between the self and the other, reshaped by algorithmic technologies; and the augmentation and alteration of spatial perception.The artworks Fedorova discusses present scenarios of interfacing that range from responsive environments to artificial intelligence conversational agents. She shows that art and aesthetic experience offer fruitful ways to reflect on the effects of contemporary technological culture, enabling encounters that shift our perspectives on the boundaries of the self and challenge the very capacity to feel human.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Press","given":"The MIT"}],"citation-key":"pressTacticsInterfacingMIT","language":"en","publisher":"The MIT Press","title":"Tactics of Interfacing | The MIT Press","type":"webpage","URL":"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tactics-interfacing"},

Digital imagery relating to the self—specifically within social media and dating networks—participates in social anxieties about passing in terms of certain sexualized, gendered identities. Thus, performance online is coded—both by ‘offline’ ideological systems as well as through ‘online’ technical systems. Despite prevalent myths that self-expression online is unbound, such restrictive ‘code’ is revealed in this essay through a study of critical artworks that transgress norms of gender and sexual expression.

Mindfulness is now all the rage. From celebrity endorsements to monks, neuroscientists and meditation coaches rubbing shoulders with CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it is clear that mindfulness has gone mainstream. Some have even called it a revolution. But what if, instead of changing the world, mindfulness has become a banal form of capitalist spirituality that mindlessly avoids social and political transformation, reinforcing the neoliberal status quo? InMcMindfulness, Ronald Purser debunks the so-called \"mindfulness revolution,\" exposinghow corporations, schools, governments and the military have coopted it as technique for social control and self-pacification. A lively and razor-sharp critique, Purser busts the myths its salesmen rely on, challenging the narrative that stress is self-imposed and mindfulness is the cure-all. If we are to harness the truly revolutionary potential of mindfulness, wehave to cast off its neoliberal shackles, liberating mindfulness for a collective awakening.","author":[{"family":"Purser","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"purserMcMindfulnessHowMindfulness2019","ISBN":"978-1-912248-31-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,9]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Repeater","source":"Amazon","title":"McMindfulness: How Mindfulness Became the New Capitalist Spirituality","title-short":"McMindfulness","type":"book"},

Although many studies have been done to obtain better results, the classification accuracies are still not satisfactory. Motivated by the success in the deep learning techniques in speech processing field, we developed a DNN architecture to classify speakers' age and gender. In this work, we propose a new data model and we make modifications in GB-RBM and the BB-RBM architectures. This work shows that DNN can be trained by using age and gender real valued data and it will have a solid expressive and distinctive capability to classify the speaker's age and gender if the DNN is skillfully initialized and trained. Experimental results showed that the proposed DNN model and modifications achieved faster learning. To evaluate the proposed model, several experiments were conducted. The dimensional grey scale displays for the activation probability of hidden units, weights and biases histograms, and the MSE metrics were used.","author":[{"family":"Qawaqneh","given":"Z."},{"family":"Abumallouh","given":"A."},{"family":"Barkana","given":"B.

  {"id":"radfordLanguageModelsAre2019","abstract":"Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspeciﬁc datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts WebText. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.","author":[{"family":"Radford","given":"Alec"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Child","given":"Rewon"},{"family":"Luan","given":"David"},{"family":"Amodei","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"}],"citation-key":"radfordLanguageModelsAre2019","container-title":"OpenAI blog","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,14]]},"language":"en","title":"Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/"},
  {"id":"radfordLearningTransferableVisual2021","abstract":"State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

As our personal devices become increasingly smaller, portable, and wearable, our notions of self continue to enfold and entangle not only with these devices, but the personal data they produce. While devices are tangible, the notion of personal data is one that is still highly intangible and ephemeral to the average user. This paper explores methods for making this data palpable through interactive, vibrotactile interfaces. Palpability is a term used by Thecla Shiphorst to “articulate an increasing physical yet invisible embodiment of technologies.” [14] To this end, we look to somatic practices and haptic technologies to design felt experiences of personal data.

This study of computational text analysis examines how computers can be used as “reading machines” to open up entirely new possibilities for literary critics. Computer-based text analysis has been employed for the past several decades as a way of searching, collating, and indexing texts. Despite this, the digital revolution has not penetrated the core activity of literary studies: interpretive analysis of written texts. Computers can handle vast amounts of data, allowing for the comparison of texts in ways that were previously too overwhelming for individuals, but they may also assist in enhancing the entirely necessary role of subjectivity in critical interpretation. This book discusses the importance of this new form of text analysis conducted with the assistance of computers. The book suggests that the rigidity of computation can be enlisted by intuition, subjectivity, and play.","author":[{"family":"Ramsay","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"ramsayReadingMachinesAlgorithmic2011","ISBN":"978-0-252-03641-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism","title-short":"Reading Machines","type":"book"},

Stable Diffusion comes with a safety filter that aims to prevent generating explicit images. Unfortunately, the filter is obfuscated and poorly documented. This makes it hard for users to prevent misuse in their applications, and to understand the filter's limitations and improve it. We first show that it is easy to generate disturbing content that bypasses the safety filter. We then reverse-engineer the filter and find that while it aims to prevent sexual content, it ignores violence, gore, and other similarly disturbing content. Based on our analysis, we argue safety measures in future model releases should strive to be fully open and properly documented to stimulate security contributions from the community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rando","given":"Javier"},{"family":"Paleka","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Lindner","given":"David"},{"family":"Heim","given":"Lennart"},{"family":"Tramèr","given":"Florian"}],"citation-key":"randoRedTeamingStableDiffusion2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2210.04610","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2210.04610","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Red-Teaming the Stable Diffusion Safety Filter","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04610"},

  {"id":"rauschBIRTHTRANSNATIONALPHILANTHROPY2018","abstract":"World War I significantly impacted U.S. society and politics long before the United States officially entered into the war's frontlines in 1917. Even as historians have begun to pay closer attention to this process, they have until now largely failed to notice a particular group of colorful and highly emblematic public elite actors: charitable foundation philanthropists. With the soon-to-be globally active Rockefeller Foundation a cohort of ambitious U.S. progressives and social engineers—later ardent supporters of global science funding during the interwar years and beyond—utilized their war experiences to shape the wartime philanthropic agenda. This article focuses on the Foundation officers’ profiles and the beginnings of their more concerted engagements during World War I in order to show how, in their mindsets and tactics, Rockefeller philanthropists disregarded American neutrality. From the outbreak of the war in 1914, they mobilized themselves to the point of pleading for and entering into direct commitments at home and abroad, especially in the European war zone. With the official entry of the United States into war in early April 1917, Rockefeller officials and collaborators became openly “combat” philanthropists, resolutely assisting the moral stabilization efforts of the U.S. military and conducting support campaigns to bolster, most notably, the American alliance with France. The incubation and infancy period of Rockefeller philanthropy as a subsequently ubiquitous phenomenon of the American twentieth century is inseparable from the impact of the Great War.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rausch","given":"Helke"}],"citation-key":"rauschBIRTHTRANSNATIONALPHILANTHROPY2018","container-title":"The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era","DOI":"10.1017/S1537781418000294","ISSN":"1537-7814, 1943-3557","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"650-662","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"THE BIRTH OF TRANSNATIONAL U.S. PHILANTHROPY FROM THE SPIRIT OF WAR: ROCKEFELLER PHILANTHROPISTS IN WORLD WAR I","title-short":"THE BIRTH OF TRANSNATIONAL U.S. PHILANTHROPY FROM THE SPIRIT OF WAR","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-gilded-age-and-progressive-era/article/birth-of-transnational-us-philanthropy-from-the-spirit-of-war-rockefeller-philanthropists-in-world-war-i/87858360A41F7F46F2AEB84AA683F95C","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"ravetto-biagioliDigitalUncanny2019","abstract":"We are now confronted with a new type of uncanny experience, an uncanny evoked by parallel processing, aggregate data, and cloud-computing. The digital uncanny does not erase the uncanny feeling we experience as déjà vu or when confronted with robots that are too lifelike. Today's uncanny refers to how non-human devices (surveillance technologies, algorithms, feedback, and data flows) anticipate human gestures, emotions, actions, and interactions, thus intimating that we are but machines and that our behavior is predicable precisely because we are machinic. It adds another dimension to those feelings in which we question whether our responses are subjective or automated - automated as in reducing one's subjectivity to patterns of data and using those patterns to present objects or ideas that would then elicit one's genuinely subjective-yet effectively preset-response. In fact, this anticipation of our responses is a feedback loop that we humans have produced by designing software that can study our traces, inputs, and moves. In this sense one could say that the digital uncanny is a trick we play on ourselves, a trick that we would not be able to play had we not developed sophisticated digital technologies. Digital Uncanny explores how digital technologies, particularly software systems working through massive amounts of data, are transforming the meaning of the uncanny that Freud tied to a return of repressed memories, desires, and experiences to their anticipation. Through a close reading of interactive and experimental art works of Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Bill Viola, Simon Biggs, Sue Hawksley, and Garth Paine, this book is designed to explore how the digital uncanny unsettles and estranges concepts of \"self,\" \"affect,\" \"feedback\" and \"aesthetic experience,\" forcing us to reflect on our relationship with computational media and by extension our relationship to each other and our experience of the world.","author":[{"family":"Ravetto-Biagioli","given":"Kriss"}],"citation-key":"ravetto-biagioliDigitalUncanny2019","event-place":"Oxford, UK ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-19-085400-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,24]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"232","publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford, UK ; New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Digital Uncanny","type":"book"},

Like Freud's uncanny, Lozano-Hemmer's work undermines stable subject positions and thus the possibility of the specific symbolic meaning for the installation. The ungrounding of subjectivity does not necessarily point to the subjects' own absence or lack of wholeness, nor to its own possible obsolescence. Rather, it points to the disjuncture between recognizing and reacting to the fact that we are being followed (by images, interfaces, and tracking devices), and recognizing and reacting to the fact that these devices already anticipate our movements, desires, and trajectories. Lozano-Hemmer's work asks about how surveillance systems, global capital, and digital technologies have reconfigured notions of embodiment and public space, and of the public itself.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Ravetto-Biagioli","given":"Kriss"}],"citation-key":"ravetto-biagioliShadowedImagesRafael2010","container-title":"Representations","container-title-short":"REPRESENTATIONS","DOI":"10.1525/rep.2010.111.1.121","ISSN":"0734-6018, 1533-855X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8,1]]},"language":"en","license":"©© 2010 The Regents of the University of California","page":"121-143","source":"rep.ucpress.edu.libproxy1.usc.edu","title":"Shadowed by Images: Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and the Art of Surveillance","title-short":"Shadowed by Images","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/111/1/121","volume":"111"},

  {"id":"reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022","abstract":"The capabilities of humans and AI systems to be creative and perform alongside one another have given rise to new practices of ‘artificial creativity’. In this article, I argue that artificial creativity demonstrates the potential to empower individuals to interface and critically dialogue with computational systems. Reframed as artificial ‘everyday’ creativity, I focus on the curious, joyful and adjacent modes of everyday creativity by including hybrid materials that embrace alternative pedagogies of code and computation. Through the interdisciplinary design approach of ‘critical making’, I craft two unconventionally-coded artefacts that dialogue with AI systems, namely CryptoCrochet-Key and Internet of Towels. Both artefacts are analysed using a four-pronged creativity framework to understand the material translation processes in the artificial everyday creativity practice. With rising concerns about AI's role in misinformation, bias and discrimination, the discussion explores the generative value and limitations of artificial everyday creativity towards the broader goals of civic data literacy and user empowerment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reddy","given":"Anuradha"}],"citation-key":"reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022","container-title":"Digital Creativity","DOI":"10.1080/14626268.2022.2138452","ISSN":"1462-6268","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,2]]},"page":"295-313","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Artificial everyday creativity: creative leaps with AI through critical making","title-short":"Artificial everyday creativity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14626268.2022.2138452","volume":"33"},

  {"id":"redmonYOLO9000BetterFaster2016","abstract":"We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Redmon","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Farhadi","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"redmonYOLO9000BetterFaster2016","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1612.08242","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,25]]},"number":"arXiv:1612.08242","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger","title-short":"YOLO9000","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242"},

  {"id":"reestorffArtworkNetWorkAffective2015","abstract":"Studies of political art and art activist practices often focus on representations and expect that art, in a clear-cut manner, provides a critique of, for instance, various forms of suppression. Yet practice often transgresses representational patterns, disciplinary boundaries, and traditional notions of the art-work. In this chapter I develop an affectively oriented methodological framework for investigating art political practices, the effect of which cannot merely be perceived as a matter of representation. The methodology relies on an understanding, not of the art-work as a coherent category, but of the net-work that emerges as an open-ended assemblage (Latour, 2005; Delanda, 2006; Anderson et al., 2010). The focus on the net-work has implications for the study of political art and affect. Because when the focus is the net-work, affect cannot be studied and identified on its own. Affect must be identified in the ways in which the net-work materializes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Reestorff","given":"Camilla M."}],"citation-key":"reestorffArtworkNetWorkAffective2015","container-title":"Affective Methodologies: Developing Cultural Research Strategies for the Study of Affect","DOI":"10.1057/9781137483195_10","editor":[{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Britta Timm"},{"family":"Stage","given":"Carsten"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-137-48319-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"201-221","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan UK","publisher-place":"London","source":"Springer Link","title":"From Artwork to Net-Work: Affective Effects of Political Art","title-short":"From Artwork to Net-Work","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137483195_10"},
  {"id":"reeveMappingDataEthics2022","abstract":"Purpose As data-driven tools increasingly shape our life and tech ethics crises become strikingly frequent, data ethics coursework is urgently needed. The purpose of this study is to map the field of data ethics curricula, tracking relations between courses, instructors, texts and writers, and present a proof-of-concept interactive website for exploring these relations. This method is designed to be used in curricular research and development and provides multiple vantage points on this multidisciplinary field. Design/methodology/approach The authors use data science methods to foster insights about the field of data ethics education and literature. The authors present a semantic, linked open data graph in the Resource Description Framework, along with proof-of-concept analyses and an exploratory website. Its framework is open-source and language-agnostic, providing the seed for future contributions of code, syllabi and resources from the global data ethics community. Findings This method provides a convenient means of exploring an overview of the field of data ethics’ social and textual relations. For educators designing or refining a course, the authors provide a method for curricular introspection and discovery of transdisciplinary curricula. Research limitations/implications The syllabi the authors have collected are self-selected and represent only a subset of the field. Furthermore, this method exclusively represents a course’s assigned literature rather than a holistic view of what courses teach. The authors present a prototype rather than a finished product. Originality/value This curricular survey provides a new way of modeling a field of study, using existing ontologies to organize graph data into a comprehensible overview. This framework may be repurposed to map the institutional knowledge structures of other disciplines, as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Reeve","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Zaugg","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Tian"}],"citation-key":"reeveMappingDataEthics2022","container-title":"Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society","DOI":"10.1108/JICES-12-2021-0124","ISSN":"1477-996X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"page":"388-399","publisher":"Emerald Publishing Limited","source":"Emerald Insight","title":"Mapping data ethics curricula","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JICES-12-2021-0124","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"ribeiroAuditingRadicalizationPathways2019","abstract":"Non-profits, as well as the media, have hypothesized the existence of a radicalization pipeline on YouTube, claiming that users systematically progress towards more extreme content on the platform. Yet, there is to date no substantial quantitative evidence of this alleged pipeline. To close this gap, we conduct a large-scale audit of user radicalization on YouTube. We analyze 330,925 videos posted on 349 channels, which we broadly classified into four types: Media, the Alt-lite, the Intellectual Dark Web (I.D.W.), and the Alt-right. According to the aforementioned radicalization hypothesis, channels in the I.D.W. and the Alt-lite serve as gateways to fringe far-right ideology, here represented by Alt-right channels. Processing 72M+ comments, we show that the three channel types indeed increasingly share the same user base; that users consistently migrate from milder to more extreme content; and that a large percentage of users who consume Alt-right content now consumed Alt-lite and I.D.W. content in the past. We also probe YouTube's recommendation algorithm, looking at more than 2M video and channel recommendations between May/July 2019. We find that Alt-lite content is easily reachable from I.D.W. channels, while Alt-right videos are reachable only through channel recommendations. Overall, we paint a comprehensive picture of user radicalization on YouTube.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribeiro","given":"Manoel Horta"},{"family":"Ottoni","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"West","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Virgílio A.

Building on the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon and the cultural techniques tradition, this book examines the constructive and cumulative character of software and retraces the historical trajectories of a series of algorithmic techniques that have become the building blocks for contemporary practices of ordering. Developed in opposition to centuries of library tradition, these techniques instantiate dynamic, perspectivist, and interested forms of knowing. Embedded in technical infrastructures and economic logics, they have become engines of order that transform how we arrange information, ideas, and people.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rieder","given":"Bernhard"}],"citation-key":"riederEnginesOrderMechanology2020","DOI":"10.5117/9789462986190","event-place":"NL Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-3741-9 978-94-6298-619-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,11]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"NL Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Engines of Order: A Mechanology of Algorithmic Techniques","title-short":"Engines of Order","type":"book","URL":"https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789462986190"},

  {"id":"rosamondSortMatchShare2018","abstract":"This paper analyses addressivity in online dating platforms, with OkCupid as its focus. Drawing from Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of addressivity, I argue the need for a generic account of online dating -one that focuses on the particular kinds of address that typify expressive scenarios on its platforms. Rather than focusing solely on how users address themselves to other users, I instead examine several layers of addressivity within the online dating scenario: (1) users addressing other users, (2) users addressing platforms, (3) platforms addressing publics, (4) companies addressing investors, and (5) investors addressing users. I argue that within surveillance capitalism generally, and within online dating platforms in particular, there is an imbalance of addressivity: though online users are broadly aware that their data may be collected and analysed, they are nonetheless unconscious of and/or uncomfortable with this form of sharing, because it does not easily fit into previously known narratives of dating. In other words, the automatic gathering and analysis of data by OkCupid is a background condition of all its users' activity-but this is not sufficiently accounted for in users' generic understandings of online dating. OkCupid cofounder Christian Rudder's continual efforts to make online dating data analytics both understandable and palatable for users (via OkCupid's promotional material, TED-Ed talks, a blog and a book on data) aims, in part, to address this imbalance. These stagings of the platform's address to its users aim to garner interest in, and acceptance of, becoming part of aggregated, privatized data sets-and indeed, coming to be witnessed and assetized by the automated gaze of data analytics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosamond","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"rosamondSortMatchShare2018","container-title":"Journal of Aesthetics and Culture; Abingdon","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org.libproxy1.usc.edu/10.1080/20004214.2017.1400864","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"English","license":"Copyright Taylor & Francis Ltd. 2018","page":"1-11","source":"ProQuest","title":"To sort, to match and to share: addressivity in online dating platforms","title-short":"To sort, to match and to share","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/2115667410/abstract/D2D3405EAB694EA0PQ/64","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"rosnerBiasCutTechnopoetics2022","abstract":"This essay explores a material engagement with discourses of bias. At a time when the developers of algorithmic systems are exploring concepts of bias like never before, textile bias (or the skew of woven material) offers an alternative view into the scripts of computational engagement. To probe this potential, this essay engages a range of feminist and anti-racist interventions in performance arts, critical archival studies, and my own pedagogical collaborations. With these experiments, I ask, how might material bias inform ongoing analysis of cultural bias within machine learning systems? The experiments reveal interwoven dynamics of power, labor, and historicity with particular attention to complicity and change. Through angular encounters with bias, I explore the development of an emerging technopoetics of algorithmic systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosner","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"rosnerBiasCutTechnopoetics2022","container-title":"Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience","DOI":"10.28968/cftt.v8i2.37867","ISSN":"2380-3312","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,7]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Daniela Rosner","number":"2","source":"catalystjournal.org","title":"The Bias Cut: Toward a Technopoetics of Algorithmic Systems","title-short":"The Bias Cut","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/37867","volume":"8"},

Drawing on feminist traditions of situated knowing, we designed an electronic quilt and a series of participatory workshops that materialize the work of the core memory weavers. With this case we not only broaden dominant stories of design, but we also reflect on the entanglement of predominantly male, high status labor with the ostensibly low-status work of women’s hands. By integrating design and archival research as a means of cultural analysis, we further expand conversations on design research methods within human-computer interaction (HCI), using design to reveal legacies of practice elided by contemporary technology cultures. In doing so, this paper highlights for HCI scholars that worlds of handwork and computing, or weaving and space travel, are not as separate as we might imagine them to be.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosner","given":"Daniela K."},{"family":"Shorey","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Craft","given":"Brock R."},{"family":"Remick","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"rosnerMakingCoreMemory2018a","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3173574.3174105","event-place":"Montreal QC Canada","event-title":"CHI '18: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5620-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1-13","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Montreal QC Canada","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Making Core Memory: Design Inquiry into Gendered Legacies of Engineering and Craftwork","title-short":"Making Core Memory","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3174105"},

Although technological innovation is associated with progress that does not mean that it necessarily narrows the gap between rich and poor, instead technological inequalities tend to exacerbate other inequalities. This applies also to information and communication technologies (ICT) and Big Data, which play an increasingly important role in humanitarianism. In this article, we address the socio-technical work that is necessary to acquire, process, store and use data and study the power relations that are embedded in these processes. We focus in particular on the use of Big Data in digital humanitarianism and argue that at each stage of the digital data life-cycle (data acquisition, data processing, data storage, and data usage and decision making) different resources are required. These include not only access to hardware, software and connectivity but also the ability to make use of the affordances of digital technologies. We posit that in the context of humanitarianism, ICT and Big Data are a particularly intriguing to study due to their ambivalent position of seeking to address inequalities while at the same time perpetuating them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Roth","given":"Silke"},{"family":"Luczak-Roesch","given":"Markus"}],"citation-key":"rothDeconstructingDataLifecycle2018","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1521457","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,18]]},"page":"1-17","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Deconstructing the data life-cycle in digital humanitarianism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1521457","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"rotmanParallelSelves2008","abstract":"Becoming Beside Ourselves continues the investigation that the renowned cultural theorist and mathematician Brian Rotman began in his previous books Signifying Nothing and Ad Infinitum...The Ghost in Turing’s Machine: exploring certain signs and the conceptual innovations and subjectivities that they facilitate or foreclose. In Becoming Beside Ourselves, Rotman turns his attention to alphabetic writing or the inscription of spoken language. Contending that all media configure what they mediate, he maintains that alphabetic writing has long served as the West’s dominant cognitive technology. Its logic and limitations have shaped thought and affect from its inception until the present. Now its grip on Western consciousness is giving way to virtual technologies and networked media, which are reconfiguring human subjectivity just as alphabetic texts have done for millennia.Alphabetic texts do not convey the bodily gestures of human speech: the hesitations, silences, and changes of pitch that infuse spoken language with affect. Rotman suggests that by removing the body from communication, alphabetic texts enable belief in singular, disembodied, authoritative forms of being such as God and the psyche. He argues that while disembodied agencies are credible and real to “lettered selves,” they are increasingly incompatible with selves and subjectivities formed in relation to new virtual technologies and networked media. Digital motion-capture technologies are restoring gesture and even touch to a prominent role in communication. Parallel computing is challenging the linear thought patterns and ideas of singularity facilitated by alphabetic language. Barriers between self and other are breaking down as the networked self is traversed by other selves to become multiple and distributed, formed through many actions and perceptions at once. The digital self is going plural, becoming beside itself.","author":[{"family":"Rotman","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"rotmanParallelSelves2008","container-title":"Becoming Beside Ourselves: The Alphabet, Ghosts, and Distributed Human Being","ISBN":"978-0-8223-8911-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,25]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Duke University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"Parallel Selves","type":"chapter"},

This is manifested in 4 ways: (a) negative potency (negative entities are stronger than the equivalent positive entities), (b) steeper negative gradients (the negativity of negative events grows more rapidly with approach to them in space or time than does the positivity of positive events, (c) negativity dominance (combinations of negative and positive entities yield evaluations that are more negative than the algebraic sum of individual subjective valences would predict), and (d) negative differentiation (negative entities are more varied, yield more complex conceptual representations, and engage a wider response repertoire). We review evidence for this taxonomy, with emphasis on negativity dominance, including literary, historical, religious, and cultural sources, as well as the psychological literatures on learning, attention, impression formation, contagion, moral judgment, development, and memory. We then consider a variety of theoretical accounts for negativity bias. We suggest that 1 feature of negative events that make them dominant is that negative entities are more contagious than positive entities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Rozin","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Royzman","given":"Edward B."}],"citation-key":"rozinNegativityBiasNegativity2001","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"296-320","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Negativity Bias, Negativity Dominance, and Contagion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2","volume":"5"},

Video Games Have Always Been Queer argues that the medium of video games itself can—and should—be read queerly. In the first book dedicated to bridging game studies and queer theory, Ruberg resists the common, reductive narrative that games are only now becoming more diverse. Revealing what reading D. A. Miller can bring to the popular 2007 video game Portal, or what Eve Sedgwick offers Pong, Ruberg models the ways game worlds offer players the opportunity to explore queer experience, affect, and desire. As players attempt to 'pass' in Octodad or explore the pleasure of failure in Burnout: Revenge, Ruberg asserts that, even within a dominant gaming culture that has proved to be openly hostile to those perceived as different, queer people have always belonged in video games—because video games have, in fact, always been queer.","author":[{"family":"Ruberg","given":"Bonnie"}],"citation-key":"rubergVideoGamesHave2019","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4798-4374-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,19]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Video Games Have Always Been Queer","type":"book"},

Given a trained model, our technique detects the use of radioactive data and provides a level of confidence (p-value). Our experiments on large-scale benchmarks (Imagenet), using standard architectures (Resnet-18, VGG-16, Densenet-121) and training procedures, show that we can detect usage of radioactive data with high confidence (p<10^-4) even when only 1% of the data used to trained our model is radioactive.

Especially through improvements in methodology, the availability of large databases and increased computational power, today’s ML algorithms are able to achieve excellent performance (at times even exceeding the human level) on an increasing number of complex tasks. Deep learning models are at the forefront of this development. However, due to their nested non-linear structure, these powerful models have been generally considered “black boxes”, not providing any information about what exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since in many applications, e.g., in the medical domain, such lack of transparency may be not acceptable, the development of methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has recently attracted increasing attention. This introductory paper presents recent developments and applications in this field and makes a plea for a wider use of explainable learning algorithms in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Samek","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Klaus-Robert"}],"citation-key":"samekExplainableArtificialIntelligence2019","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Explainable AI: Interpreting, Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_1","editor":[{"family":"Samek","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Montavon","given":"Grégoire"},{"family":"Vedaldi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Lars Kai"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Klaus-Robert"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-28954-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"5-22","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Towards Explainable Artificial Intelligence","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_1"},

In this work, we put forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by LMs -- by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls and their associated human responses. Using this framework, we create OpinionsQA, a new dataset for evaluating the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups over topics ranging from abortion to automation. Across topics, we find substantial misalignment between the views reflected by current LMs and those of US demographic groups: on par with the Democrat-Republican divide on climate change. Notably, this misalignment persists even after explicitly steering the LMs towards particular demographic groups. Our analysis not only confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, but also surfaces groups whose opinions are poorly reflected by current LMs (e.g., 65+ and widowed individuals).

The perceived toxicity of language can vary based on someone’s identity and beliefs, but this variation is often ignored when collecting toxic language datasets, resulting in dataset and model biases. We seek to understand the who, why, and what behind biases in toxicity annotations. In two online studies with demographically and politically diverse participants, we investigate the effect of annotator identities (who) and beliefs (why), drawing from social psychology research about hate speech, free speech, racist beliefs, political leaning, and more. We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three characteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect, and vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity and beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative annotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were less likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE as toxic. We additionally present a case study illustrating how a popular toxicity detection system’s ratings inherently reflect only specific beliefs and perspectives. Our findings call for contextualizing toxicity labels in social variables, which raises immense implications for toxic language annotation and detection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Sap","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Swayamdipta","given":"Swabha"},{"family":"Vianna","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xuhui"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yejin"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Noah"}],"citation-key":"sapAnnotatorsAttitudesHow2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies","DOI":"10.18653/v1/2022.naacl-main.431","event-place":"Seattle, United States","event-title":"Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"5884-5906","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Seattle, United States","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Annotators with Attitudes: How Annotator Beliefs And Identities Bias Toxic Language Detection","title-short":"Annotators with Attitudes","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.431"},

Simple, well-motivated architectural variations that transfer across tasks and scale, increasing the impact of modeling research.

Notably, it can be difficult to evaluate how modeling decisions may impact emergent capabilities, given that these capabilities arise mainly from sheer scale.Targeting a multilingual language model in the 100B+ parameters scale, our goal is to identify an architecture and training setup that makes the best use of our 1,000,000 A100-GPU-hours budget. Specifically, we perform an ablation study comparing different modeling practices and their impact on zero-shot generalization. We perform all our experiments on 1.3B models, providing a compromise between compute costs and the likelihood that our conclusions will hold for the target 100B+ model. In addition, we study the impact of various popular pretraining corpora on zero-shot generalization. We also study the performance of a multilingual model and how it compares to the English-only one.

With increased technical capabilities, machine learning research has boomed in both academic and industry settings, and one major focus has been on computer vision. Computer vision is a popular domain of machine learning increasingly pertinent to real-world applications, from facial recognition in policing to object detection for autonomous vehicles. Given computer vision's propensity to shape machine learning research and impact human life, we seek to understand disciplinary practices around dataset documentation - how data is collected, curated, annotated, and packaged into datasets for computer vision researchers and practitioners to use for model tuning and development. Specifically, we examine what dataset documentation communicates about the underlying values of vision data and the larger practices and goals of computer vision as a field. To conduct this study, we collected a corpus of about 500 computer vision datasets, from which we sampled 114 dataset publications across different vision tasks. Through both a structured and thematic content analysis, we document a number of values around accepted data practices, what makes desirable data, and the treatment of humans in the dataset construction process. We discuss how computer vision datasets authors value efficiency at the expense of care; universality at the expense of contextuality; impartiality at the expense of positionality; and model work at the expense of data work. Many of the silenced values we identify sit in opposition with social computing practices. We conclude with suggestions on how to better incorporate silenced values into the dataset creation and curation process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheuerman","given":"Morgan Klaus"},{"family":"Hanna","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Denton","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"scheuermanDatasetsHavePolitics2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"scheuermanHowComputersSee2019","abstract":"Investigations of facial analysis (FA) technologies-such as facial detection and facial recognition-have been central to discussions about Artificial Intelligence's (AI) impact on human beings. Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of \"torque\" and \"residuality\" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheuerman","given":"Morgan Klaus"},{"family":"Paul","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Jed R."}],"citation-key":"scheuermanHowComputersSee2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

Facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Scheuerman","given":"Morgan Klaus"},{"family":"Wade","given":"Kandrea"},{"family":"Lustig","given":"Caitlin"},{"family":"Brubaker","given":"Jed R."}],"citation-key":"scheuermanHowWeVe2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction","container-title-short":"Proc.

As large models require millions of training examples to achieve good performance, it is difficult to completely prevent them from being exposed to such content. In this paper, we first demonstrate a surprising finding: pretrained language models recognize, to a considerable degree, their undesirable biases and the toxicity of the content they produce. We refer to this capability as self-diagnosis. Based on this finding, we then propose a decoding algorithm that, given only a textual description of the undesired behavior, reduces the probability of a language model producing problematic text. We refer to this approach as self-debiasing. Self-debiasing does not rely on manually curated word lists, nor does it require any training data or changes to the model's parameters. While we by no means eliminate the issue of language models generating biased text, we believe our approach to be an important step in this direction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schick","given":"Timo"},{"family":"Udupa","given":"Sahana"},{"family":"Schütze","given":"Hinrich"}],"citation-key":"schickSelfDiagnosisSelfDebiasingProposal2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2103.00453","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,9]]},"number":"arXiv:2103.00453","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing: A Proposal for Reducing Corpus-Based Bias in NLP","title-short":"Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00453"},

Critical writing is part of this cycle of making and imagining. It can shape the contexts in which work is made and received, playing not just a responsive role but actively shaping how and what it is possible to make, see, do, and say. And critical writing is also shaped by the circumstances in which it is written, as part of systems of production and distribution.This article gives examples of a number of initiatives by individual writers, artist collectives, and festivals that test forms of critical writing that are as experimental as the practices to which they relate. Drawing on the author's experience running workshops in critical writing practice, it takes inspiration from the expanded field of writing as theorized and practiced in performance writing, placing these ideas in relation to a writing practice that conceives itself as ‘criticism’. It is intended as a practical guide that might be used by writers or workshop leaders to cultivate their own critical writing projects, and to inspire imaginative thinking about writing and conversation as creative practices in their own right.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Theron"}],"citation-key":"schmidtHowWeTalk2018","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2018.1464751","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,17]]},"page":"37-43","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How We Talk About The Work Is The Work","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2018.1464751","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"schullDataLifeWearable2016","abstract":"Over the last 5 years, wearable technology – comprising devices whose embedded sensors and analytic algorithms can track, analyze and guide wearers’ behavior – has increasingly captured the attention of venture capitalists, technology startups, established electronics companies and consumers. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call ‘data for life’, wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Schüll","given":"Natasha Dow"}],"citation-key":"schullDataLifeWearable2016","container-title":"BioSocieties","container-title-short":"BioSocieties","DOI":"10.1057/biosoc.2015.47","ISSN":"1745-8560","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"317-333","source":"Springer Link","title":"Data for life: Wearable technology and the design of self-care","title-short":"Data for life","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/biosoc.2015.47","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"schuppliMaterialWitnessMedia2020","abstract":"The evidential role of matter--when media records trace evidence of violence--explored through a series of cases drawn from Kosovo, Japan, Vietnam, and elsewhere. In this book, Susan Schuppli introduces a new operative concept: material witness, an exploration of the evidential role of matter as both registering external events and exposing the practices and procedures that enable matter to bear witness. Organized in the format of a trial, Material Witness moves through a series of cases that provide insight into the ways in which materials become contested agents of dispute around which stake holders gather. These cases include an extraordinary videotape documenting the massacre at Izbica, Kosovo, used as war crimes evidence against Slobodan Miloševic; the telephonic transmission of an iconic photograph of a South Vietnamese girl fleeing an accidental napalm attack; radioactive contamination discovered in Canada's coastal waters five years after the accident at Fukushima Daiichi; and the ecological media or \"disaster film\" produced by the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Each highlights the degree to which a rearrangement of matter exposes the contingency of witnessing, raising questions about what can be known in relationship to that which is seen or sensed, about who or what is able to bestow meaning onto things, and about whose stories will be heeded or dismissed. An artist-researcher, Schuppli offers an analysis that merges her creative sensibility with a forensic imagination rich in technical detail. Her goal is to relink the material world and its affordances with the aesthetic, the juridical, and the political","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuppli","given":"Susan"}],"citation-key":"schuppliMaterialWitnessMedia2020","ISBN":"978-0-262-35719-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 1130309740","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Material witness: media, forensics, evidence","title-short":"Material witness","type":"book","URL":"https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&scope=site&db=nlebk&db=nlabk&AN=2367742"},

In this article, we show that organizational sociology can contribute to a more nuanced perspective on “algorithmic decision-making.” Drawing on the concept of decision premises, we differentiate between various formal structures, particularly between different decision programs (conditional and purposive). This allows us to challenge two key assumptions, namely that human decision-makers rely heavily on algorithmically generated recommendations and that discrimination against protected groups needs to be solved mainly at the level of code.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwarting","given":"Rena"},{"family":"Ulbricht","given":"Lena"}],"citation-key":"schwartingWhyOrganizationMatters2022","container-title":"KZfSS Kölner Zeitschrift für Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie","container-title-short":"Köln Z Soziol","DOI":"10.1007/s11577-022-00838-3","ISSN":"1861-891X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"307-330","source":"Springer Link","title":"Why Organization Matters in “Algorithmic Discrimination”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11577-022-00838-3","volume":"74"},
  {"id":"schwartzLowFemmeLow2020","abstract":"Are memes theory? Memes and femmes are both marked by failure; femmes fail to be sufficiently feminine, or sufficiently queer, memes fail as cultural productions, plagued by low-culture. Together, I argue, femmes and memes produce low theory. In my study of femme memes, I argue that they can be understood as making significant political and cultural contributions if framed by existing scholarship on memes that emphasize political and communicative functions (Chen 2012). Drawing from existing scholarship on internet memes, as well as feminist and queer theory, I argue that femmes are low theory practitioners, and memes are a mode of theorizing—a form of marginalized knowledge production that comes from a long lineage of the feminized, DIY cultures that occur in marginal spaces, like girlhood bedrooms. In this paper, I examine three key themes of femme memes—casual misandry, femme invisibility, and emotional vulnerability—to argue that femmes use memes to queer femininity and position femme as a political thinker and feeler. Through the creation and circulation of femme memes, femmes create a femme public that is both political and affective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Andi"}],"citation-key":"schwartzLowFemmeLow2020","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2020.1861050","ISSN":"1468-0777","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,10]]},"page":"1-16","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Low Femme, low theory: memes and the new bedroom culture","title-short":"Low Femme, low theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2020.1861050","volume":"0"},

Given renewed interest in the experience of women online, we ask: does exposure to abusive comments affect perceptions of women authors’ credibility? And does this penalty extend to the outlet? To answer these questions, we employed a survey experiment which manipulated exposure to an abusive comment, and author gender. We found a significant effect for the abusive comment on author credibility and intention to seek news from the author and outlet in the future, but gender of the author did not moderate these effects. To ensure the null effects for gender were not an artifact of comment or topic, we fielded two additional survey experiments. Across topics, whether the abuse was gendered or gender-specific, we found abusive comments exert significant negative effects on evaluations, regardless of author gender. Our results have implications for news organizations considering comments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Searles","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Spencer","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Duru","given":"Adaobi"}],"citation-key":"searlesDonReadComments2018","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2018.1534985","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10,25]]},"page":"1-16","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Don’t read the comments: the effects of abusive comments on perceptions of women authors’ credibility","title-short":"Don’t read the comments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1534985","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"sengersReflectiveDesign2005","abstract":"As computing moves into every aspect of our daily lives, the values and assumptions that underlie our technical practices may unwittingly be propagated throughout our culture. Drawing on existing critical approaches in computing, we argue that reflection on unconscious values embedded in computing and the practices that it supports can and should be a core principle of technology design. Building on a growing body of work in critical computing, reflective design combines analysis of the ways in which technologies reflect and perpetuate unconscious cultural assumptions, with design, building, and evaluation of new computing devices that reflect alternative possibilities. We illustrate this approach through two design case studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sengers","given":"Phoebe"},{"family":"Boehner","given":"Kirsten"},{"family":"David","given":"Shay"},{"family":"Kaye","given":"Joseph 'Jofish'"}],"citation-key":"sengersReflectiveDesign2005","collection-title":"CC '05","container-title":"Proceedings of the 4th Decennial Conference on Critical Computing: Between Sense and Sensibility","DOI":"10.1145/1094562.1094569","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-59593-203-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"49–58","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Reflective Design","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1094562.1094569"},

  {"id":"shanahanTalkingLargeLanguage2023","abstract":"Thanks to rapid progress in artificial intelligence, we have entered an era when technology and philosophy intersect in interesting ways. Sitting squarely at the centre of this intersection are large language models (LLMs). The more adept LLMs become at mimicking human language, the more vulnerable we become to anthropomorphism, to seeing the systems in which they are embedded as more human-like than they really are. This trend is amplified by the natural tendency to use philosophically loaded terms, such as \"knows\", \"believes\", and \"thinks\", when describing these systems. To mitigate this trend, this paper advocates the practice of repeatedly stepping back to remind ourselves of how LLMs, and the systems of which they form a part, actually work. The hope is that increased scientific precision will encourage more philosophical nuance in the discourse around artificial intelligence, both within the field and in the public sphere.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Shanahan","given":"Murray"}],"citation-key":"shanahanTalkingLargeLanguage2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2212.03551","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,25]]},"number":"arXiv:2212.03551","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Talking About Large Language Models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03551"},

  {"id":"sharmaItUsuallyNot2022","abstract":"In nationwide efforts to promote computing education, undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have been identified as an effective way to not only motivate research and graduate studies, but to also increase participation and retention, promote disciplinary knowledge and diversity in the field, develop strong soft and technical skills, and integrate students in the community. Yet, despite these many benefits, opportunities for UREs are still limited. And even though the challenge of finding faculty mentors is one of the major barriers, there is still limited research exploring the faculty perspective in greater depth. In this paper, we leveraged an onboarding process for a new program to interview twelve engineering faculty doing computing-related research in a large public research institution about their experiences and perspectives towards UREs. These faculty members ranged in experience from working regularly with many undergraduates to having limited or no prior experience. Our analysis uncovered four main themes on barriers to UREs around the central concept of misalignment: misalignments between the educational system and research, misalignments between faculty and student goals, misalignments between expectations of research and reality, and the challenge of getting to and maintaining steady state when trying to create alignment. We conclude by discussing design implications for designing programs and computational ecosystems that scale access to UREs by helping to overcome misalignments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Rhea"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Atira"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Palea","given":"Dustin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"David T."}],"citation-key":"sharmaItUsuallyNot2022","collection-title":"ICER '22","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research - Volume 1","DOI":"10.1145/3501385.3543976","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9194-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,3]]},"page":"149–163","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"“It’s usually not worth the effort unless you get really lucky”: Barriers to Undergraduate Research Experiences from the Perspective of Computing Faculty","title-short":"“It’s usually not worth the effort unless you get really lucky”","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3501385.3543976"},

Most age and gender estimation systems using face images are trained on ethnicity-biased databases. Therefore, these systems show limited performance on face images of ethnic groups occupying a small proportion of the training data. To resolve this problem, we propose an age and gender estimation system that considers the ethnic difference in face images. At the first stage of the system, the ethnicity of the facial image is determined by a CNN trained with manually collected face images of Asian and non-Asian celebrities. Then, one of the SVM classifiers is selected according to the ethnicity for the final age and gender estimation.

GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4 demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear. We refer to this effect as Model Collapse and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web. Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Shumailov","given":"Ilia"},{"family":"Shumaylov","given":"Zakhar"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yiren"},{"family":"Gal","given":"Yarin"},{"family":"Papernot","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Ross"}],"citation-key":"shumailovCurseRecursionTraining2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2305.17493","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.17493","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Curse of Recursion: Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget","title-short":"The Curse of Recursion","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493"},

Even in these datasets, and typically in `untidy' or raw data, practitioners are faced with significant issues of data quality and diversity which can be prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology -- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest. Our method is on par with far more sophisticated mitigation methods across different tasks: identifying and correcting mislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples, prioritizing points relevant for training and enabling scalable human auditing of relevant examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Siddiqui","given":"Shoaib Ahmed"},{"family":"Rajkumar","given":"Nitarshan"},{"family":"Maharaj","given":"Tegan"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"David"},{"family":"Hooker","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"siddiquiMetadataArchaeologyUnearthing2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,20]]},"number":"arXiv:2209.10015","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Metadata Archaeology: Unearthing Data Subsets by Leveraging Training Dynamics","title-short":"Metadata Archaeology","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10015"},
  {"id":"siegertCulturalTechniquesGrids2015","abstract":"In a crucial shift within posthumanistic media studies, Bernhard Siegert dissolves the concept of media into a network of operations that reproduce, displace, process, and reflect the distinctions fundamental for a given culture. Cultural Techniques aims to forget our traditional understanding of media so as to redefine the concept through something more fundamental than the empiricist study of a medium's individual or collective uses or of its cultural semantics or aesthetics. Rather, Siegert seeks to relocate media and culture on a level where the distinctions between object and performance, matter and form, human and nonhuman, sign and channel, the symbolic and the real are still in the process of becoming. The result is to turn ontology into a domain of all that is meant in German by the word Kultur. Cultural techniques comprise not only self-referential symbolic practices like reading, writing, counting, or image-making. The analysis of artifacts as cultural techniques emphasizes their ontological status as \"in-betweens,\" shifting from firstorder to second-order techniques, from the technical to the artistic, from object to sign, from the natural to the cultural, from the operational to the representational. Cultural Techniques ranges from seafaring, drafting, and eating to the production of the sign-signaldistinction in old and new media, to the reproduction of anthropological difference, to the study of trompe-l'oeils, grids, registers, and doors. Throughout, Siegert addresses fundamental questions of how ontological distinctions can be replaced by chains of operations that process those alleged ontological distinctions within the ontic. Grounding posthumanist theory both historically and technically, this book opens up a crucial dialogue between new German media theory and American postcybernetic discourses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Siegert","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"young","given":"geoffrey","non-dropping-particle":"winthrop-"}],"citation-key":"siegertCulturalTechniquesGrids2015","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctt14jxrmf","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Fordham University Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Cultural Techniques: Grids, Filters, Doors, and Other Articulations of the Real","title-short":"Cultural Techniques","type":"book","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt14jxrmf"},

Contrary to the rhetoric of ‘sharing’ and ‘disruption’ associated with it, this paper proposes that these changes are far more dependent upon existing class-, race- and gender-based constructions of the subject and property ownership than is often assumed. Drawing upon interviews and findings from a study combining qualitative methods with Software Studies approaches, we argue that the bourgeois paradigm of ‘possessive individualism’ has been extended and capitalized through platforms such as Facebook. In doing so, the potential for capital to extract value from possessions and capacities (such as land and labour) has been extended to capture value from personal attributes (as data) through processes of curation and aggregation. In doing so, the ambiguity between property and propriety upon which the bourgeois subject was originally founded is expanded whilst simultaneously extending and exploiting the inequalities that this facilitates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Skeggs","given":"Beverly"},{"family":"Yuill","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"skeggsSubjectsValueDigital2019","container-title":"Subjectivity","container-title-short":"Subjectivity","DOI":"10.1057/s41286-018-00063-4","ISSN":"1755-635X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"82-99","source":"Springer Link","title":"Subjects of value and digital personas: reshaping the bourgeois subject, unhinging property from personhood","title-short":"Subjects of value and digital personas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1057/s41286-018-00063-4","volume":"12"},

It examines three existing kinds of participation in design practice and machine learning participation as work, participation as consultation, and as participation as justice – to argue that the machine learning community must become attuned to possibly exploitative and extractive forms of community involvement and shift away from the prerogatives of context independent scalability. Cautioning against “participation washing”, it argues that the notion of “participation” should be expanded to acknowledge more subtle, and possibly exploitative, forms of community involvement in participatory machine learning design. Specifically, it suggests that it is imperative to recognize design participation as work; to ensure that participation as consultation is context-specific; and that participation as justice must be genuine and long term. The paper argues that such a development can only be scaffolded by a new epistemology around design harms, including, but not limited to, in machine learning.

The image under these new conditions is filtered, fluid, fleeting, permeable, mobile and distributed and is changing our ways of seeing. The chapters in this volume are the outcome of research conducted at the Centre for the Study of the Networked Image (CSNI) and its collaboration with The Photographers’ Gallery over the last ten years. The book's contributors investigate radical changes in the meanings and values of hybridised media in socio-technical networks and speak to the creeping automation of culture through applications of AI, social media platforms and the financialisation of data.\nThis interdisciplinary collection draws upon media and cultural studies, art history, art practice, photographic theory, user design, animation, museology and computer science as a way of making sense of the specific cultural consequences of the rapid succession of changes in image technologies and to bring the story up to date.

The book considers how creative practice can lead to research insights through what is often known as practice-led research. But unlike other books on practice-led research, it balances this with discussion of how research can impact positively on creative practice through research-led practice. The editors posit an iterative and web-like relationship between practice and research. Essays within the book cover a wide range of disciplines including creative writing, dance, music, theatre, film and new media, and the contributors are from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The subject is approached from numerous angles: the authors discuss methodologies of practice-led research and research-led practice, their own creative work as a form of research, research training for creative practitioners, and the politics and histories of practice-led research and research-led practice within the university. The book will be invaluable for creative practitioners, researchers, students in the creative arts and university leaders.

  {"id":"smitsAgencyComputerVision2021","abstract":"Industry and governments have deployed computer vision models to make high-stake decisions in society. While they are often presented as neutral and objective, scholars have recognized that bias in these models might lead to the reproduction of racial, social, cultural and economic inequity. A growing body of work situates the provenance of bias in the collection and annotation of datasets that are needed to train computer vision models. This article moves from studying bias in computer vision models to the agency that is commonly attributed to them: the fact that they are universally seen as being able to make biased decisions. Building on the work of Bruno Latour and Jonathan Crary, the authors discuss computer vision models as agential optical instruments in the production of contemporary visuality. They analyse five interconnected research steps – task selection, category selection, data collection, data labelling and evaluation – of six widely cited benchmark datasets, published during a critical stage in the development of the field (2004–2020): Caltech 101, Caltech 256, PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, MS COCO and Google Open Images. They found that, despite all sorts of justifications, the selection of categories is not based on any general notion of visuality, but depends heavily upon perceived practical applications, the availability of downloadable images and, in conjunction with data collection, favours categories that can be unambiguously described by text. Second, the reliance on Flickr for data collection introduces a temporal bias in computer vision datasets. Third, by comparing aggregate accuracy rates and ‘human’ performance, the dataset papers introduce a false dichotomy between the agency of computer vision models and human observers.

  {"id":"sobchackAddressEyePhenomenology1992","abstract":"Cinema is a sensuous object, but in our presence it becomes also a sensing, sensual, sense-making subject. Thus argues Vivian Sobchack as she challenges basic assumptions of current film theory that reduce film to an object of vision and the spectator to a victim of a deterministic cinematic apparatus. Maintaining that these premises ignore the material and cultural-historical situations of both the spectator and the film, the author makes the radical proposal that the cinematic experience depends on two \"viewers\" viewing: the spectator and the film, each existing as both subject and object of vision. Drawing on existential and semiotic phenomenology, and particularly on the work of Merleau-Ponty, Sobchack shows how the film experience provides empirical insight into the reversible, dialectical, and signifying nature of that embodied vision we each live daily as both \"mine\" and \"another's.\" In this attempt to account for cinematic intelligibility and signification, the author explores the possibility of human choice and expressive freedom within the bounds of history and culture.","author":[{"family":"Sobchack","given":"Vivian"}],"citation-key":"sobchackAddressEyePhenomenology1992","event-place":"Princeton, NJ","ISBN":"978-0-691-00874-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"354","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton, NJ","source":"Amazon","title":"The Address of the Eye: A Phenomenology of Film Experience","title-short":"The Address of the Eye","type":"book"},
  {"id":"sobierajBitchSlutSkank2018","abstract":"Resistance to women’s public voice and visibility via street harassment and workplace sexual harassment have long constrained women’s use of and comfort in physical public spaces; this gender-based resistance now extends into digital arenas. Women face extreme hostility in the form of digital sexism in discussion rooms, comment sections, gaming communities, and on social media platforms. Reflecting on two years of in-depth interviews with women who have been on the receiving end of gender-based digital abuse (n = 38), conversations with industry professionals working in content moderation and digital safety, the extant literature, and news stories about digital attacks against women, I offer a lens to think through the prominent patterns in digital sexism, showing (1) that aggressors draw upon three overlapping strategies – intimidating, shaming, and discrediting – to limit women’s impact in digital publics, (2) the way femininity and femaleness are used to undermine women’s contributions, and (3) men call attention to women’s physicality as a way to pull gender – and the male advantage that comes with it – to the fore in digital exchanges. Finally, I argue that when digital sexism succeeds in pressing women out of digital spaces, constrains the topics they address publicly, or limits the ways they address them, we must consider the democratic costs of gender-based harassment, in addition to the personal ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sobieraj","given":"Sarah"}],"citation-key":"sobierajBitchSlutSkank2018","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2017.1348535","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,2]]},"page":"1700-1714","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Bitch, slut, skank, cunt: patterned resistance to women’s visibility in digital publics","title-short":"Bitch, slut, skank, cunt","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1348535","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"solaimanEvaluatingSocialImpact2023","abstract":"Generative AI systems across modalities, ranging from text, image, audio, and video, have broad social impacts, but there exists no official standard for means of evaluating those impacts and which impacts should be evaluated. We move toward a standard approach in evaluating a generative AI system for any modality, in two overarching categories: what is able to be evaluated in a base system that has no predetermined application and what is able to be evaluated in society. We describe specific social impact categories and how to approach and conduct evaluations in the base technical system, then in people and society. Our framework for a base system defines seven categories of social impact: bias, stereotypes, and representational harms; cultural values and sensitive content; disparate performance; privacy and data protection; financial costs; environmental costs; and data and content moderation labor costs. Suggested methods for evaluation apply to all modalities and analyses of the limitations of existing evaluations serve as a starting point for necessary investment in future evaluations. We offer five overarching categories for what is able to be evaluated in society, each with their own subcategories: trustworthiness and autonomy; inequality, marginalization, and violence; concentration of authority; labor and creativity; and ecosystem and environment. Each subcategory includes recommendations for mitigating harm. We are concurrently crafting an evaluation repository for the AI research community to contribute existing evaluations along the given categories.

We propose a Process for Adapting Language Models to Society (PALMS) with Values-Targeted Datasets, an iterative process to signiﬁcantly change model behavior by crafting and ﬁne-tuning on a dataset that reﬂects a predetermined set of target values. We evaluate our process using three metrics: quantitative metrics with human evaluations that score output adherence to a target value, and toxicity scoring on outputs; and qualitative metrics analyzing the most common word associated with a given social category. Through each iteration, we add additional training dataset examples based on observed shortcomings from evaluations. PALMS performs signiﬁcantly better on all metrics compared to baseline and control models for a broad range of GPT-3 language model sizes without compromising capability integrity. We ﬁnd that the eﬀectiveness of PALMS increases with model size.

  {"id":"sousanisUnflattening2015","abstract":"The primacy of words over images has deep roots in Western culture. But what if the two are inextricably linked, equal partners in meaning-making? Written and drawn entirely as comics, Unflattening is an experiment in visual thinking. Nick Sousanis defies conventional forms of scholarly discourse to offer readers both a stunning work of graphic art and a serious inquiry into the ways humans construct knowledge.Unflattening is an insurrection against the fixed viewpoint. Weaving together diverse ways of seeing drawn from science, philosophy, art, literature, and mythology, it uses the collage-like capacity of comics to show that perception is always an active process of incorporating and reevaluating different vantage points. While its vibrant, constantly morphing images occasionally serve as illustrations of text, they more often connect in nonlinear fashion to other visual references throughout the book. They become allusions, allegories, and motifs, pitting realism against abstraction and making us aware that more meets the eye than is presented on the page.In its graphic innovations and restless shape-shifting, Unflattening is meant to counteract the type of narrow, rigid thinking that Sousanis calls “flatness.” Just as the two-dimensional inhabitants of Edwin A. Abbott’s novella Flatland could not fathom the concept of “upwards,” Sousanis says, we are often unable to see past the boundaries of our current frame of mind. Fusing words and images to produce new forms of knowledge, Unflattening teaches us how to access modes of understanding beyond what we normally apprehend.","author":[{"family":"Sousanis","given":"Nick"}],"citation-key":"sousanisUnflattening2015","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-674-74443-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,20]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"208","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Amazon","title":"Unflattening","type":"book"},

Infrastructure is both relational and ecological?it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Star","given":"Susan Leigh"}],"citation-key":"starEthnographyInfrastructure1999","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/00027649921955326","ISSN":"0002-7642","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"377-391","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The Ethnography of Infrastructure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027649921955326","volume":"43"},

But do unsupervised computer vision models automatically learn implicit patterns and embed social biases that could have harmful downstream effects? We develop a novel method for quantifying biased associations between representations of social concepts and attributes in images. We find that state-of-the-art unsupervised models trained on ImageNet, a popular benchmark image dataset curated from internet images, automatically learn racial, gender, and intersectional biases. We replicate 8 previously documented human biases from social psychology, from the innocuous, as with insects and flowers, to the potentially harmful, as with race and gender. Our results closely match three hypotheses about intersectional bias from social psychology. For the first time in unsupervised computer vision, we also quantify implicit human biases about weight, disabilities, and several ethnicities. When compared with statistical patterns in online image datasets, our findings suggest that machine learning models can automatically learn bias from the way people are stereotypically portrayed on the web.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Steed","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Caliskan","given":"Aylin"}],"citation-key":"steedImageRepresentationsLearned2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3442188.3445932","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,3]]},"page":"701-713","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Image Representations Learned With Unsupervised Pre-Training Contain Human-like Biases","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15052"},

  {"id":"stewartOrdinaryAffects2007","abstract":"Ordinary Affects is a singular argument for attention to the affective dimensions of everyday life and the potential that animates the ordinary. Known for her focus on the poetics and politics of language and landscape, the anthropologist Kathleen Stewart ponders how ordinary impacts create the subject as a capacity to affect and be affected. In a series of brief vignettes combining storytelling, close ethnographic detail, and critical analysis, Stewart relates the intensities and banalities of common experiences and strange encounters, half-spied scenes and the lingering resonance of passing events. While most of the instances rendered are from Stewart’s own life, she writes in the third person in order to reflect on how intimate experiences of emotion, the body, other people, and time inextricably link us to the outside world.Stewart refrains from positing an overarching system—whether it’s called globalization or neoliberalism or capitalism—to describe the ways that economic, political, and social forces shape individual lives. Instead, she begins with the disparate, fragmented, and seemingly inconsequential experiences of everyday life to bring attention to the ordinary as an integral site of cultural politics. Ordinary affect, she insists, is registered in its particularities, yet it connects people and creates common experiences that shape public feeling. Through this anecdotal history—one that poetically ponders the extremes of the ordinary and portrays the dense network of social and personal connections that constitute a life—Stewart asserts the necessity of attending to the fleeting and changeable aspects of existence in order to recognize the complex personal and social dynamics of the political world.","author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"stewartOrdinaryAffects2007","ISBN":"978-0-8223-4107-9","issued":{"literal":"-09-20 2007"},"language":"en","publisher":"Duke University Press","title":"Ordinary Affects","type":"book"},

  {"id":"stocchettiMatterMeaningLife2023","abstract":"The main reason for concerns about the social impact of AI textual functions relate not primarily to the labour market or education, but to the political economy of meaning. The starting point of this critique is the analysis of ‘artificial intelligence’ as a metaphor that hide and mystifies fundamental differences between human and AI textual functions. This metaphor reduces intelligence to its computational and instrumental aspects and establishes instrumental rationality as a normative model for human intelligence. Contra these implications, I argue the case for the revaluation of meaning-making and textual functions of intelligence as an adaptive response to the problem of death which is uniquely human. These functions are politically relevant because human texts are the tools for the transformation of the subjective experience of life and death into the intersubjective sense of reality. To delegate these functions to advanced forms of computational technology is tempting but risky because the expurgation of subjectivity and, more broadly, the suppression of the dilemmas constituting the human conditions, weakens fundamental evolutionary competences, enhance the oppressive potential of instrumental reason and leads to the unfreedom of the post-political condition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Stocchetti","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"stocchettiMatterMeaningLife2023","container-title":"Hipertext.net","DOI":"10.31009/hipertext.net.2023.i26.12","ISSN":"1695-5498","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,26]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2023 Matteo Stocchetti","number":"26","page":"77-81","source":"raco.cat","title":"A matter of meaning, life and death.

  {"id":"strasserLinguaRealisLingua1989","abstract":"This historical analysis treats the formation of universal languages with the help of analogy in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the early part of the 16th century, abbot Johannes Trithemius suggested a universal language as an extension of a cryptographic system he had proposed. Trithemius's process suggests a triangular relationship among a lingua cryptologica, which stands at the root of his system, a lingua realis – an existing language (almost exclusively Latin) that served as a point of departure, and a lingua universalis, which was developed from that base. Trithemius's ideas remained, however, rather isolated for the balance of the 16th century since other scholars were preoccupied with the search for the lingua Adamica. It was not until Bacon and Descartes discussed the phenomenon of universal communication that new universal languages were proposed. The concept of analogy can be seen in a number of mid-17th century written-communication methods that were based on an existing language. After various Jesuits had devised preliminary systems, Athanasius Kircher, Johann Joachim Becher and the young Leibniz – all going back to Trithemius – began again with a lingua cryptologica, used a lingua realis (Latin) as an intermediary and reference language, and developed a lingua universalis as they understood it. All three universal languages could be expressed in a mathematical-combinatorial system, which Becher transcended by proposing a graphic, binomial method purportedly even more universally acceptable than the simply numerical systems of transmission. In all these instances we are actually dealing with reverse analogies, for what had been conceived as a system of secret communication became adapted to a universal, written exchange, thereby differing substantially from such 19th century creations as Martin Schleyer's Volapük or Dr. Zamenhof's Esperanto, the only universal language that is widely used in our times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Strasser","given":"Gerhard F."}],"citation-key":"strasserLinguaRealisLingua1989","container-title":"Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte","DOI":"10.1002/bewi.19890120402","ISSN":"1522-2365","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989"]]},"language":"de","license":"Copyright © 1989 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  {"id":"striphasAlgorithmicCulture2015","abstract":"Over the last 30 years or so, human beings have been delegating the work of culture – the sorting, classifying and hierarchizing of people, places, objects and ideas – increasingly to computational processes. Such a shift significantly alters how the category culture has long been practiced, experienced and understood, giving rise to what, following Alexander Galloway, I am calling ‘algorithmic culture’. The purpose of this essay is to trace some of the conceptual conditions out of which algorithmic culture has emerged and, in doing so, to offer a preliminary treatment on what it is. In the vein of Raymond Williams’ Keywords, I single out three terms whose bearing on the meaning of the word culture seems to have been unusually strong during the period in question: information, crowd and algorithm. My claim is that the offloading of cultural work onto computers, databases and other types of digital technologies has prompted a reshuffling of some of the words most closely associated with culture, giving rise to new senses of the term that may be experientially available but have yet to be well named, documented or recorded. This essay, though largely historical, concludes by connecting the dots critically to the present day. What is at stake in algorithmic culture is the gradual abandonment of culture’s publicness and the emergence of a strange new breed of elite culture purporting to be its opposite.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Striphas","given":"Ted"}],"citation-key":"striphasAlgorithmicCulture2015","container-title":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","container-title-short":"European Journal of Cultural Studies","DOI":"10.1177/1367549415577392","ISSN":"1367-5494","issue":"4-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"395-412","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Algorithmic culture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1367549415577392","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"suchmanArtificialIntelligenceCraftwork1993","abstract":"There are two ways in which the visualization processes we are all interested in may be ignored; one is to grant to the scientific mind what should be granted to the hands, to the eyes and to the signs; the other is to focus exclusively on the signs qua signs, without considering the mobilization of which they are but the fine edge.(Latour, 1986, p. 26)The goal of research in artificial intelligence (AI) is to design runnable computer programs that replicate some aspect of human behavior. A common first step in the design process is to represent in some form the behavior to be replicated. In this chapter we consider representational practice in AI as the practical activity of two researchers working together at a whiteboard (i.e., a white “blackboard” used with colored markers). In locating the science there, we aim to bring into focus its character as socially organized craftsmanship – the crafting together of a complex machinery made of heterogeneous materials, mobilized in the service of developing a theory of mind. In this effort we align ourselves with recent developments in the investigation and respecification of science as practice, beginning with GarfinkePs recommendations (1967) that we take sociology's subject matter to be the identifying details of particular forms of practical action, and Lave's analyses (1988) of the social and material structuring of specifically situated activity systems. Prior ethnomethodological studies of science orient us as well to the centrality of representational devices in the structuring of science practice (see, e.g., Garfinkel, Lynch, &amp; Livingston, 1981; Lynch, 1985; Lynch, Livingston, &amp; Garfinkel, 1983; Livingston, 1986; Lynch &amp; Woolgar, 1990), as does Latour's notion of inscription devices (1986).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Suchman","given":"Lucy A."},{"family":"Trigg","given":"Randall H."}],"citation-key":"suchmanArtificialIntelligenceCraftwork1993","collection-title":"Learning in Doing: Social, Cognitive and Computational Perspectives","container-title":"Understanding Practice: Perspectives on Activity and Context","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511625510.007","editor":[{"family":"Lave","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Chaiklin","given":"Seth"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-0-521-55851-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"page":"144-178","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Artificial intelligence as craftwork","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/understanding-practice/artificial-intelligence-as-craftwork/455368F2AF1A326E59F35DA97BFB6F0A"},
  {"id":"sukhijaTopicModelingVisualization2016","abstract":"Topic modeling is a widely used approach for analyzing large text collections. In particular, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most popular topic modeling approaches to aggregate vocabulary from a document corpus to form latent \"topics\". However, learning meaningful topic models with massive document collections which contain millions of documents, billions of tokens is challenging, given the complexity of the data involved, the difficulty in distributing the computation across multiple computing nodes. In recent years some data processing frameworks, such as Spark, Mallet, others have been developed to address the issues associated with analyzing large volumes of unlabeled text pertaining to various domains in a scalable, efficient manner. In this paper, we will present a preliminary case study demonstrating the scholarship achieved in the study of political consumerism via XSEDE resources. The experimental study will showcase the use of digitized social sciences data, text analytics toolkits to generate topic models, visualize topics for empowering intersectional research engaging the relationship between consumption, race, class, gender in the area of sociology. Consequently, this comparative big data textual analysis involving use of JSTOR data, LDA modeling toolkit's, visualization techniques, computational components is of paramount importance, especially for researchers from academic domain dealing with social science applications involving big data.","author":[{"family":"Sukhija","given":"N."},{"family":"Tatineni","given":"M."},{"family":"Brown","given":"N."},{"family":"Moer","given":"M.

  {"id":"sundenGlitchGenusTillfalligt2016","abstract":"Technologies always implicate their own failures, breakdowns, and glitches. The purpose of this article is to develop an understanding of gender in general – and femininity in particular – as something fundamentally technological, and, as such, broken. Drawing on the technological undercurrent in current posthumanist feminist theory, arguing for a re-introduction of technologies in the midst of feminist posthumanist critique, the author puts into play a vocabulary of malfunctioning, broken, vulnerable technologies of gender. In particular, the term “glitch” is put to use to account for machinic failures in gender within the digital domain. By using glitch as a way of theorizing gender, the article is a dual contribution to digital media studies and feminist theory in a technological vein. Glitch is the spinning wheel on the computer screen, the delay between a command given and its execution. Etymologically, glitch (possibly) derives from the Yiddish word glitsh, meaning a “slippery place” or “a slip.” Glitch signals the slipperiness of something or someone off balance and a loss of control. It usually refers to a sudden unexpected event, a surge of current or an illegitimate signal that breaks the flow of energy, information, and affect. Glitch is, fundamentally, a struggle with binary code. Gender is a similar struggle to cope with binaries, with a loss of binaries, and about what happens when the vulnerability of the system is revealed. On this side of glitch, the tendency is toward hesitation and anticipation, irritation and annoyance, as well as pain and anxiety in the face of technologies and bodies that skip, crash, or get stuck. The default mode of gender is technological failure, and cis-gender normativity – what the author calls gender “high fidelity” – an unobtainable ideal of impossible perfection. If to glitch is to slip, to stutter, to stumble, gender high fidelity is to slip by unnoticed. In contrast to the notion of cis-gender normativity as a desire to cover or remove “noise,” to clear the channel, glitch is that which infiltrate, make dirty, and ultimately put pressure on the norms and ideals that structure gender as pure, clear, cold, binary code. In this sense, glitch is also about a perceived beauty in crashing and skipping, holding an intriguing critical, aesthetic, activist potential. In the hands of glitch artists, circuit breakers, and gamers, but also queers, and trans-performers, glitch becomes a celebration of the beauty of malfunction and gender-technological fragility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Sundén","given":"Jenny"}],"citation-key":"sundenGlitchGenusTillfalligt2016","container-title":"Lambda Nordica; Stockholm","event-place":"Stockholm, Sweden, Stockholm","ISSN":"11002573","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"English","license":"© 2016.

  {"id":"sundenQueerDisconnectionsAffect2018","abstract":"In this article, my intent is to theorise the intricate relation between technology and affect by considering questions of digital vulnerability – of disconnections, breaks, and delays – as a way of rethinking our affective attachments to digital devices. By extension, I also connect this argument with a framework of queer theory, as an opportunity to think differently about relations through questions of technological ruptures and deferrals. My bassline for this endeavour is the idea of the break as formative for how we can both sense and make sense of digital connectivity, in so far as the break has the potential to bring forth what constant connectivity means, and how it feels. Similarly, the break can potentially make tangible relational norms around continuous, coherent, and linear ways of relating and connecting, and thus provide alternative models for ways of being with digital devices, networks, and each other. If constant connectivity provides us with a relational norm of sorts, then disconnection could function as a queer orientation device with the potential of creating openings for other ways of coming together, and other ways of staying together.","author":[{"family":"Sundén","given":"Jenny"}],"citation-key":"sundenQueerDisconnectionsAffect2018","issue":"31","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"63-78","source":"Zotero","title":"Queer Disconnections: Affect, Break, and Delay in Digital Connectivity","type":"article-journal","volume":"Transformations"},
  {"id":"sundenShamelessHagsTolerance2018","abstract":"This article explores shamelessness as a feminist tactic of resistance to online misogyny, hate and shaming within a Nordic context. In our Swedish examples, this involves affective reclaiming of the term \"hagga\" (hag), which has come to embody shameless femininity and feminist solidarity, as well as the Facebook event \"Skamlös utsläckning\" (shameless extinction), which extends the solidarity or the hag to a collective of non-men. Our Finnish examples revolve around appropriating derisive terms used of women defending multiculturalism and countering the current rise of nationalist anti-immigration policy and activism across Web platforms, such as \"kukkahattutäti\" (aunt with a flower hat) and \"suvakkihuora\" (\"overtly tolerant whore\"). Drawing on Facebook posts, blogs and discussion forums, the article conceptualizes the affective dynamics and intersectional nature of online hate against women and other others. More specifically, we examine the dynamics of shaming and the possibilities of shamelessness as a feminist tactic of resistance. Since online humor often targets women, racial others and queers, the models of resistance that this article uncovers add a new stitch to its memetic logics. We propose that a networked politics of reclaiming is taking shape, one using collective imagination and wit to refuel feminist communities.","author":[{"family":"Sundén","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Paasonen","given":"Susanna"}],"citation-key":"sundenShamelessHagsTolerance2018","container-title":"Feminist Media Studies","DOI":"10.1080/14680777.2018.1447427","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,4]]},"language":"English","page":"643-656","title":"Shameless hags and tolerance whores: feminist resistance and the affective circuits of online hate","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14680777.2018.1447427","volume":"18"},

It discusses aspects of the body as a political instance, the identity and subjectivity building of individuals and groups, (micro-)practices of dissent, and theories of critique from different disciplinary perspectives. This collection thus touches upon contemporary issues, recent protests and movements, artistic subversion and dissent, online activism as well as historic developments and elemental theories of dissent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,21]]},"citation-key":"TakingSidesTheories2021","DOI":"10.1515/9783839449011","ISBN":"978-3-8394-4901-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"transcript Verlag","source":"www-degruyter-com.libproxy1.usc.edu","title":"Taking Sides: Theories, Practices, and Cultures of Participation in Dissent","title-short":"Taking Sides","type":"book","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783839449011/html"},
  {"id":"tanPsychologyFilm2018","abstract":"The cinema as a cultural institution has been studied by academic researchers in the arts and humanities. At present, cultural media studies are the home to the aesthetics and critical analysis of film, film history and other branches of film scholarship. Probably less known to most is that research psychologists working in social and life science labs have also contributed to the study of the medium. They have examined the particular experience that motion pictures provide to the film audience and the mechanisms that explain the perception and comprehension of film, and how movies move viewers and to what effects. This article reviews achievements in psychological research of the film since its earliest beginnings in the 1910s. A leading issue in the research has been whether understanding films is a bottom-up process, or a top-down one. A bottom-up explanation likens film-viewing to highly automated detection of stimulus features physically given in the supply of images; a top-down one to the construction of scenes from very incomplete information using mental schemata. Early film psychologists tried to pinpoint critical features of simple visual stimuli responsible for the perception of smooth movement. The riddle of apparent motion has not yet been solved up to now. Gestalt psychologists were the first to point at the role of mental structures in seeing smooth movement, using simple visual forms and displays. Bottom-up and top-down approaches to the comprehension of film fought for priority from the 60s onwards and became integrated at the end of the century. Gibson’s concept of direct perception led to the identification of low-level film-stylistic cues that are used in mainstream film production, and support film viewers in highly automated seamless perception of film scenes. Hochberg’s argument for the indispensability of mental schemata, too, accounted for the smooth cognitive construction of portrayed action and scenes. Since the 90s, cognitive analyses of narration in film by film scholars from the humanities have revolutionised accounts of the comprehension of movies. They informed computational content analyses that link low-level film features with meaningful units of film-story-telling. After a century of research, some perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that support our interaction with events in the real world have been uncovered. Today, the film experience at large has reappeared on the agenda. An integration of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms is sought in explaining the remarkable intensity of the film experience. Advances are now being made in grasping what it is like to enjoy movies, by describing the absorbing and moving qualities of the experience. As an example, a current account of film viewers' emotional experience is presented. Further advances in our understanding of the film experience and its underlying mechanisms can be expected if film psychologists team up with cognitive film studies, computer vision and the neurosciences. This collaboration is also expected to allow for research into mainstream and other genres as forms of art.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Ed S."}],"citation-key":"tanPsychologyFilm2018","container-title":"Palgrave Communications","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-018-0111-y","ISSN":"2055-1045","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,3]]},"language":"En","license":"2018 The Author(s)","page":"82","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A psychology of the film","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0111-y","volume":"4"},

Computers―from electronic books to smart phones―play an active role in our social lives. Our technological choices thus entail theoretical and political commitments. Dennis Tenen takes up today's strange enmeshing of humans, texts, and machines to argue that our most ingrained intuitions about texts are profoundly alienated from the physical contexts of their intellectual production. Drawing on a range of primary sources from both literary theory and software engineering, he makes a case for a more transparent practice of human–computer interaction. Plain Text is thus a rallying call, a frame of mind as much as a file format.

  {"id":"thoppilanLaMDALanguageModels2022","abstract":"We present LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications. LaMDA is a family of Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of LaMDA in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Thoppilan","given":"Romal"},{"family":"De Freitas","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Jamie"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Kulshreshtha","given":"Apoorv"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Heng-Tze"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Baker","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Du","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Li","given":"YaGuang"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hongrae"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Huaixiu Steven"},{"family":"Ghafouri","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Menegali","given":"Marcelo"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yanping"},{"family":"Krikun","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Lepikhin","given":"Dmitry"},{"family":"Qin","given":"James"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Dehao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuanzhong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhifeng"},{"family":"Roberts","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Bosma","given":"Maarten"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yanqi"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Chung-Ching"},{"family":"Krivokon","given":"Igor"},{"family":"Rusch","given":"Will"},{"family":"Pickett","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Pranesh"},{"family":"Man","given":"Laichee"},{"family":"Meier-Hellstern","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Morris","given":"Meredith Ringel"},{"family":"Doshi","given":"Tulsee"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Renelito Delos"},{"family":"Duke","given":"Toju"},{"family":"Soraker","given":"Johnny"},{"family":"Zevenbergen","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Prabhakaran","given":"Vinodkumar"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Hutchinson","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Molina","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Hoffman-John","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Josh"},{"family":"Aroyo","given":"Lora"},{"family":"Rajakumar","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Butryna","given":"Alena"},{"family":"Lamm","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Kuzmina","given":"Viktoriya"},{"family":"Fenton","given":"Joe"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Kurzweil","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Aguera-Arcas","given":"Blaise"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Croak","given":"Marian"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc"}],"citation-key":"thoppilanLaMDALanguageModels2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2201.08239","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,10]]},"number":"arXiv:2201.08239","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications","title-short":"LaMDA","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08239","version":"2"},

  {"id":"tkaczBeingDataDashboarding2022","abstract":"Once the rarified stuff of scientists and statisticians, data are now at the heart of our global digital economy, transforming everything from how we perceive the value of a professional athlete to the intelligence gathering activities of governments. We are told that the right data can turn an election, help predict crime, improve our businesses, our health and our capacity to make decisions. Beginning with a simple question - how do most people encounter and experience data? - Nathaniel Tkacz sets out on a path at odds with much of the contemporary discussion about data. When we encounter data, he contends, it is often in highly routinised ways, through formatted displays and for specific cognitive tasks. What data are and can do is largely a matter of how they are formatted. To understand our 'datafied' societies, we need to turn our attention to data's formats and the powers of formatting. This book offers an account of one such format: the dashboard. From their first appearance with the horse and carriage, Tkacz guides readers on the historical development of this format. Through analyses of car dashboards, early managerial dashboards, and the gradual emergence of dashboards as a computer display technology, Tkacz shows how today's digital dashboards came to be, and how their cultural history conditions the present. Highly original and wide-ranging, this book will change how you think about data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tkacz","given":"Nathaniel"}],"citation-key":"tkaczBeingDataDashboarding2022","event-place":"Newark, UNITED KINGDOM","ISBN":"978-1-5095-5085-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Polity Press","publisher-place":"Newark, UNITED KINGDOM","source":"ProQuest Ebook Central","title":"Being with Data: The Dashboarding of Everyday Life","title-short":"Being with Data","type":"book","URL":"http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/socal/detail.action?docID=7008418"},

  {"id":"tranFeministPossibilityReaderasPerformer2018","abstract":"For decades, performance artists and playwrights have grappled with how spectators view women’s bodies on stage. Thwarting those patriarchal structures that constantly shape how we see gendered bodies has proven difficult. This article asks: what happens when we remove the visible body altogether? Exploring the experimental performance poetry of Caroline Bergvall, I reconsider the text/performance divide to suggest that the divide itself holds within it a fundamental anti-feminist tendency: the ultimately empirical claim that a body must be ‘seen’ to exist. As the poem affectively inscribes the experience of the female in the text onto the body of the reader, there is a performative and affective resistance to performance’s obsession with the supposed positive politics of the non-reproductive and the ocular. Engaging critically with works by Peggy Phelan, Rebecca Schneider, Brian Massumi, and Rachel Blau DuPlessis (among others), I find that in opposition to the work of much performance scholarship, reproduction is feminist performative writing’s raison d’être in so many ways. Indeed, the opportunity for using reproductive processes for a feminist imagining of possibility catapults us into a reconfiguration of language wherein marginalized experiences can be reproduced on live bodies themselves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tran","given":"Sydney"}],"citation-key":"tranFeministPossibilityReaderasPerformer2018","container-title":"Performance Research","DOI":"10.1080/13528165.2018.1464762","ISSN":"1352-8165","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,17]]},"page":"82-85","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"The Feminist Possibility of Reader-as-Performer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2018.1464762","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"traubAgoraBringingTogether2021","abstract":"Data science and artificial intelligence are driven by a plethora of diverse data-related assets, including datasets, data streams, algorithms, processing software, compute resources, and domain knowledge. As providing all these assets requires a huge investment, data science and artificial intelligence technologies are currently dominated by a small number of providers who can afford these investments. This leads to lock-in effects and hinders features that require a flexible exchange of assets among users. In this paper, we introduce Agora, our vision towards a unified ecosystem that brings together data, algorithms, models, and computational resources and provides them to a broad audience. Agora (i) treats assets as first-class citizens and leverages a fine-grained exchange of assets, (ii) allows for combining assets to novel applications, and (iii) flexibly executes such applications on available resources. As a result, it enables easy creation and composition of data science pipelines as well as their scalable execution. In contrast to existing data management systems, Agora operates in a heavily decentralized and dynamic environment: Data, algorithms, and even compute resources are dynamically created, modified, and removed by different stakeholders. Agora presents novel research directions for the data management community as a whole: It requires to combine our traditional expertise in scalable data processing and management with infrastructure provisioning as well as economic and application aspects of data, algorithms, and infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Traub","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Kaoudi","given":"Zoi"},{"family":"Quiané-Ruiz","given":"Jorge-Arnulfo"},{"family":"Markl","given":"Volker"}],"citation-key":"traubAgoraBringingTogether2021","container-title":"ACM SIGMOD Record","container-title-short":"SIGMOD Rec.","DOI":"10.1145/3456859.3456861","ISSN":"0163-5808","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,10]]},"page":"6–11","source":"December 2020","title":"Agora: Bringing Together Datasets, Algorithms, Models and More in a Unified Ecosystem [Vision]","title-short":"Agora","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.org/10.1145/3456859.3456861","volume":"49"},

Secondly, I develop a feminist technoecological account of interaction at the ELIZA/user interface.

For the development of real-time spoken dialog systems and the analysis of affective and social human behavior in conversations, it is important to (automatically) distinguish between these two types of overlap. We investigate acoustic characteristics of cooperative and competitive overlaps with the aim to develop automatic classiﬁers for the classiﬁcation of overlaps. In addition to acoustic features, we also use information from gaze and head movement annotations. Contexts preceding and during the overlap are taken into account, as well as the behaviors of both the overlapper and the overlappee. We compare various feature sets in classiﬁcation experiments that are performed on the AMI corpus.

  {"id":"tuckDecolonizationNotMetaphor2012","abstract":"Our goal in this article is to remind readers what is unsettling about decolonization. Decolonization brings about the repatriation of Indigenous land and life; it is not a metaphor for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. The easy adoption of decolonizing discourse by educational advocacy and scholarship, evidenced by the increasing number of calls to “decolonize our schools,” or use “decolonizing methods,” or, “decolonize student thinking”, turns decolonization into a metaphor. As important as their goals may be, social justice, critical methodologies, or approaches that decenter settler perspectives have objectives that may be incommensurable with decolonization. Because settler colonialism is built upon an entangled triad structure of settler-native-slave, the decolonial desires of white, non-white, immigrant, postcolonial, and oppressed people, can similarly be entangled in resettlement, reoccupation, and reinhabitation that actually further settler colonialism. The metaphorization of decolonization makes possible a set of evasions, or “settler moves to innocence”, that problematically attempt to reconcile settler guilt and complicity, and rescue settler futurity. In this article, we analyze multiple settler moves towards innocence in order to forward “an ethic of incommensurability” that recognizes what is distinct and what is sovereign for project(s) of decolonization in relation to human and civil rights based social justice projects. We also point to unsettling themes within transnational/Third World decolonizations, abolition, and critical space-place pedagogies, which challenge the coalescence of social justice endeavors, making room for more meaningful potential alliances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuck","given":"Eve"},{"family":"Yang","given":"K.

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The socio-cultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of \"screen captures\" for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Tufekci","given":"Zeynep"}],"citation-key":"tufekciBigQuestionsSocial2014","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1403.7400","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,15]]},"number":"arXiv:1403.7400","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Big Questions for Social Media Big Data: Representativeness, Validity and Other Methodological Pitfalls","title-short":"Big Questions for Social Media Big Data","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.7400"},

  {"id":"tynesDigitalIntersectionalityTheory2016","abstract":"From race, sex, class, and culture, the multidisciplinary field of Internet studies needs theoretical and methodological approaches that allow us to question the organization of social relations that are embedded in digital technologies, and that foster a clearer understanding of how power relations are organized through technologies. Representing a scholarly dialogue among established and emerging critical media and information studies scholars, this volume provides a means of foregrounding new questions, methods, and theories which can be applied to digital media, platforms, and infrastructures. These inquiries include, among others, how representation to hardware, software, computer code, and infrastructures might be implicated in global economic, political, and social systems of control. Contributors argue that more research needs to explicitly trace the types of uneven power relations that exist in technological spaces. By looking at both the broader political and economic context and the many digital technology acculturation processes as they are differentiated intersectionally, a clearer picture emerges of how under-acknowledging culturally situated and gendered information technologies are impacting the possibility of participation with (or purposeful abstinence from) the Internet. This book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate courses in Internet studies, library and information studies, communication, sociology, and psychology. It is also ideal for researchers with varying expertise and will help to advance theoretical and methodological approaches to Internet research. -- Publisher description.","author":[{"family":"Tynes","given":"Brendesha M."},{"family":"Schuschke","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Safiya Umoja"}],"citation-key":"tynesDigitalIntersectionalityTheory2016","collection-title":"Digital formations, vol. 105","container-title":"The intersectional Internet: race, sex, class and culture online","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-4331-3000-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"eng","page":"21-40","publisher":"Peter Lang Publishing, Inc","publisher-place":"New York","source":"uosc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","title":"Digital Intersectionality Theory and the #Blacklivesmatter Movement","type":"chapter"},

When using and analyzing data, the scientists implicitly agree to follow standards, procedures, and rules set in these fields. However, guidance on the responsibilities of the data scientists and the other involved actors in a data science project is typically missing. While literature shows that novel frameworks and tools are being proposed in support of open-science, data reuse, and research data management, there are currently no frameworks that can fully express responsibilities of a data science project. In this paper, we describe the Transparency, Accountability, Privacy, and Societal Responsibility Matrix (TAPS-RM) as framework to explore social, legal, and ethical aspects of data science projects. TAPS-RM acts as a tool to provide users with a holistic view of their project beyond key outcomes and clarifies the responsibilities of actors. We map the developed model of TAPS-RM with well-known initiatives for open data (such as FACT, FAIR and Datasheets for datasets). We conclude that TAPS-RM is a tool to reflect on responsibilities at a data science project level and can be used to advance responsible data science by design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Urovi","given":"Visara"},{"family":"Celebi","given":"Remzi"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chang"},{"family":"Rieswijk","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Erard","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Yilmaz","given":"Arif"},{"family":"Moodley","given":"Kody"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Parveen"},{"family":"Dumontier","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"uroviTAPSResponsibilityMatrix2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2302.01041","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,2]]},"number":"arXiv:2302.01041","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"TAPS Responsibility Matrix: A tool for responsible data science by design","title-short":"TAPS Responsibility Matrix","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01041"},

Thus, transfeminist movements emerge in order to open spaces and discursive fields to all those practices and subjects that are left out or strongly demarcate themselves from the neoliberal reconversion of the critical apparatuses of feminisms, a reconversion that today we know as biologicist gender policies or cis-women politics.

  {"id":"vandijckFacebookEngineeringConnectivity2013","abstract":"This article aims to explain how Web 2.0 platforms in general, and Facebook in particular, engineers online connections. Connectivity has become the material and metaphorical wiring of our culture, a culture in which technologies shape and are shaped not only by economic and legal frames, but also by users and content. The emergence of social media platforms is at the heart of a shifting dynamic, where various actors (technology, users, content, legal and economic actors) are building a connective space for communication and information. In order to comprehend this interwovenness, Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory will be invoked to explore how social media platforms can be analysed as techno-socio-cultural artefacts; this theoretical framework will be complemented by Castells’ political-economy approach to arrive at a fuller understanding of how social media operate. The documentary Catfish (2010) serves as an illustration to explore social media platforms in their multiple dimensions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dijck","given":"José","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vandijckFacebookEngineeringConnectivity2013","container-title":"Convergence","container-title-short":"Convergence","DOI":"10.1177/1354856512457548","ISSN":"1354-8565","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"141-155","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Facebook and the engineering of connectivity: A multi-layered approach to social media platforms","title-short":"Facebook and the engineering of connectivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1354856512457548","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"vanloonWordEmbeddingsReveal2023","abstract":"Central to affect control theory are culturally shared meanings of concepts. That these sentiments overlap among members of a culture presumably reflects their roots in the language use that members observe. Yet, the degree to which the affective meaning of a concept is encoded in the way linguistic representations of that concept are used in everyday symbolic exchange has yet to be demonstrated. The question has methodological as well as theoretical significance for affect control theory, as language may provide an unobtrusive, behavioral method of obtaining EPA ratings complementary to those heretofore obtained via questionnaires. We pursue a series of studies that evaluate whether tools from machine learning and computational linguistics can capture the fundamental affective meaning of concepts from large text corpora. We develop an algorithm that uses word embeddings to predict EPA profiles available from a recent EPA dictionary derived from traditional questionnaires, as well as novel concepts collected using an open-source web app we have developed. Across both a held-out portion of the available data as well as the novel data, our best predictions correlate with survey-based measures of the E, P, and A ratings of concepts at a magnitude greater than 0.85, 0.8, and 0.75 respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Loon","given":"Austin","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Freese","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"vanloonWordEmbeddingsReveal2023","container-title":"American Behavioral Scientist","DOI":"10.1177/00027642211066046","ISSN":"0002-7642","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175-200","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Word Embeddings Reveal How Fundamental Sentiments Structure Natural Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00027642211066046","volume":"67"},
  {"id":"vanrossemOntologyExplorerMethod2022","abstract":"This article introduces the methodology of the ‘Ontology Explorer’, a semantic method and JavaScript-based open-source tool to analyse data models underpinning information systems. The Ontology Explorer has been devised and developed by the authors, who recognized a need to compare data models collected in different formats and used by diverse systems. The Ontology Explorer is distinctive firstly because it supports analyses of information systems that are not immediately comparable and, secondly, because it systematically and quantitatively supports discursive analysis of ‘thin’ data models – also by detecting differences and absences through comparison. When applied to data models underpinning systems for population management, the Ontology Explorer enables the apprehension of how people are ‘inscribed’ in information systems: which assumptions are made about them, and which possibilities are excluded by design. The Ontology Explorer thus constitutes a methodology to capture authorities’ own imaginaries of populations and the ‘scripts’ through which they enact actual people. Furthermore, the method allows the comparison of scripts from diverse authorities. This is exemplified by illustrating its functioning with information systems for population management deployed at the European border. Our approach integrates a number of insights from early infrastructure studies and extends their methods and analytical depth to account for contemporary data infrastructures. By doing so, we hope to trigger a systematic discussion on how to extend those early methodical innovations at the semantic level to contemporary developments in digital methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Rossem","given":"Wouter"},{"family":"Pelizza","given":"Annalisa"}],"citation-key":"vanrossemOntologyExplorerMethod2022","container-title":"Big Data & Society","container-title-short":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517221104087","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"20539517221104087","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"The ontology explorer: A method to make visible data infrastructures for population management","title-short":"The ontology explorer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221104087","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023","abstract":"The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vaswani","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Uszkoreit","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Llion"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Aidan N."},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Lukasz"},{"family":"Polosukhin","given":"Illia"}],"citation-key":"vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"number":"arXiv:1706.03762","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Attention Is All You Need","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"},

While most research has focused on negative outcomes, including ethical problems of machine bias and accountability, little has been said about the possibilities of users to resist algorithmic power. The article draws on Raymond Williams’ work on media as practice to advance a framework for studying algorithms with a focus on user agency. We illustrate this framework with the example of the media activist campaign World White Web by the Swedish artist and visual designer Johanna Burai. We suggest that user agency in relation to algorithms can emerge from alternative uses of platforms, in the aftermath of algorithmic logics, and give birth to complicit forms of resistance that work through ‘repair’ politics oriented towards correcting the work of algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of the ways in which the proposed framework helps us rethink debates on algorithmic power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Velkova","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Kaun","given":"Anne"}],"citation-key":"velkovaAlgorithmicResistanceMedia2019","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657162","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,26]]},"page":"1-18","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Algorithmic resistance: media practices and the politics of repair","title-short":"Algorithmic resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2019.1657162","volume":"0"},

This book brings together critical interrogations of what constitutes AI, its impact and its inequalities in order to offer an analysis of what it means for AI to deliver benefits for everyone. The book is structured in three parts: Part 1, AI: Humans vs. Machines, presents critical perspectives on human-machine dualism. Part 2, Discourses and Myths About AI, excavates metaphors and policies to ask normative questions about what is ‘desirable’ AI and what conditions make this possible. Part 3, AI Power and Inequalities, discusses how the implementation of AI creates important challenges that urgently need to be addressed.

Probing the contradiction of using a device that produces loudness to enforce silence laws, I offer an account of how designed artifacts and techniques can be instrumentalized by the State for the policing of racialized bodies and their sonic and musical practices. These artifacts and techniques create and reproduce mechanisms that produce both physical and social distance between bodies perceived to be “loud” and their silence-enforcing counterpart (i.e. the police). This extends the reach and scope of the segregation of (auditory) space with techniques besides architecture and urban planning alone. I begin with an analysis of a few, violent strategies employed by the Military Police to enforce silence laws in lower-class neighborhoods in the city, as depicted in a filmed raid edited and posted on their own social media channels. I then read these practices through the history of the so-called “stun grenade,” or sound bomb, and its use in both military and civilian contexts. Lastly, I examine a semi-fictional proposition found in Adirley Queirós’ 2015 film Branco Sai, Preto Fica (White Out, Black In) for disrupting the enforcement of silence, which in turn proposes a decolonizing shift in the perception of loudness and noise vis-à-vis racialized bodies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Vieira de Oliveira","given":"Pedro J.

  {"id":"vonbuschZenAbstractMachine2013","abstract":"When approaching the crafts, especially knitting, the craft's long history and refined traditional techniques can easily give the impression that everything has already been invented, or at least that innovation is limited and specific to certain forms, either in patterns or technology. However, a craft like knitting should not be too dissimilar to chess, where young masters will beat their predecessors because they find new, clever paths through the immense possibilities of the game. Crafts like knitting are not usually connected to the idea of progress, yet innovation is an inherent but often overlooked part of the practice, and rarely do we encounter new methods at the very material level. This article approaches knitting with a Deleuzoguattarian perspective and frames the “virtual” mechanisms behind knitting that could be tweaked and tuned in order to power innovation. Comparing knitting to the protocols of software or the “Zen” of the loops themselves may add a theoretical framework to help expose new dimensions of the underlying diagrams of knitting. With such an approach we may better understand the capacities with which to “hack” the abstract machine of knitting, as we can see in the works of artists like Amy Twigger Holroyd and Rudiger Schlömer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Von Busch","given":"Otto"}],"citation-key":"vonbuschZenAbstractMachine2013","container-title":"TEXTILE","DOI":"10.2752/175183513X13588738654774","ISSN":"1475-9756","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"page":"6-19","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Zen and the Abstract Machine of Knitting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.2752/175183513X13588738654774","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022","abstract":"Research in machine learning fairness has historically considered a single binary demographic attribute; however, the reality is of course far more complicated. In this work, we grapple with questions that arise along three stages of the machine learning pipeline when incorporating intersectionality as multiple demographic attributes: (1) which demographic attributes to include as dataset labels, (2) how to handle the progressively smaller size of subgroups during model training, and (3) how to move beyond existing evaluation metrics when benchmarking model fairness for more subgroups. For each question, we provide thorough empirical evaluation on tabular datasets derived from the US Census, and present constructive recommendations for the machine learning community. First, we advocate for supplementing domain knowledge with empirical validation when choosing which demographic attribute labels to train on, while always evaluating on the full set of demographic attributes. Second, we warn against using data imbalance techniques without considering their normative implications and suggest an alternative using the structure in the data. Third, we introduce new evaluation metrics which are more appropriate for the intersectional setting. Overall, we provide substantive suggestions on three necessary (albeit not sufficient!) considerations when incorporating intersectionality into machine learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Angelina"},{"family":"Ramaswamy","given":"Vikram V"},{"family":"Russakovsky","given":"Olga"}],"citation-key":"wangIntersectionalityMachineLearning2022","collection-title":"FAccT '22","container-title":"2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency","DOI":"10.1145/3531146.3533101","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-9352-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"page":"336–349","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Towards Intersectionality in Machine Learning: Including More Identities, Handling Underrepresentation, and Performing Evaluation","title-short":"Towards Intersectionality in Machine Learning","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533101"},

This article extends this concept by arguing that online subjectivity is not a property of human users, but of digital subjects enacted in circulating data. It develops the digital subject by, first, using Phillip Agre’s concept of “grammars of action” to argue that computational architectures exclude humans from the position of the user; and, second, using Gilbert Simondon’s and Yuk Hui’s philosophies of technology to posit the digital subject as a determinate technical entity that, as per Hui’s reworking of Simondon, inhabits a “digital milieu”. Online, this digital subject inverts the human–technology relationship. It individuates by entering circulation, excluding us from individuating whilst individuating us in turn.

  {"id":"washingtonBlasianInvasionRacial2017","abstract":"\"Myra S. Washington probes the social construction of race through the mixed-race identity of Blasians, people of Black and Asian ancestry. She looks at the construction of the identifier Blasian and how this term went from being undefined to forming a significant role in popular media. Today Blasian has emerged as not just an identity Black/Asian mixed-race people can claim, but also a popular brand within the industry and a signifier in the culture at large. Washington tracks the transformation of Blasian from being an unmentioned category to a recognized status applied to other Blasian figures in media. Blasians have been neglected as a meaningful category of people in research, despite an extensive history of Black and Asian interactions within the United States and abroad. Washington explains that even though Americans have mixed in every way possible, racial mixing is framed in certain ways, which almost always seem to involve Whiteness. Unsurprisingly, media discourses about Blasians mostly conform to usual scripts already created, reproduced, and familiar to audiences about monoracial Blacks and Asians. In the first book on this subject, Washington regards Blasians as belonging to more than one community, given their multiple histories and experiences. Moving beyond dominant rhetoric, she does not harp on defining or categorizing mixed race, but instead recognizes the multiplicities of Blasians and the process by which they obtain meaning. Washington uses celebrities, including Kimora Lee, Dwayne Johnson, Hines Ward, and Tiger Woods, to highlight how they challenge and destabilize current racial debate, create spaces for themselves, and change the narratives that frame multiracial people. Finally, Washington asserts Blasians as not only evidence for the fluidity of identities, but also for the limitations of reductive racial binaries. \"--","author":[{"family":"Washington","given":"Myra S."}],"call-number":"HT1523 .W373 2017","citation-key":"washingtonBlasianInvasionRacial2017","collection-title":"Race, rhetoric, and media series","event-place":"Jackson","ISBN":"978-1-4968-1422-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"number-of-pages":"167","publisher":"University Press of Mississippi","publisher-place":"Jackson","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Blasian invasion: racial mixing in the celebrity industrial complex","title-short":"Blasian invasion","type":"book"},

Contrasting with the once dominant symbolic AI, large-scale learning systems have become a semiotic infrastructure underlying global capitalism. Their achievements are based on a digital version of the sign-function index, which points rather than describes. As these algorithms spread to parse the increasingly heavy data volumes on platforms, it becomes harder to remain skeptical of their results.

The goal of the project was to annotate a large corpus comprising various genres of text (news, conversational telephone speech, weblogs, usenet newsgroups, broadcast, talk shows) in three languages (English, Chinese, and Arabic) with structural information (syntax and predicate argument structure) and shallow semantics (word sense linked to an ontology and coreference).</p><br> \n<p>OntoNotes Release 5.0 contains the content of earlier releases -- OntoNotes Release 1.0 <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2007T21\" rel=\"nofollow\">LDC2007T21</a>, OntoNotes Release 2.0 <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T04\" rel=\"nofollow\">LDC2008T04</a>, OntoNotes Release 3.0 <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2009T24\" rel=\"nofollow\">LDC2009T24</a> and OntoNotes Release 4.0 <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T03\" rel=\"nofollow\">LDC2011T03</a> -- and adds source data from and/or additional annotations for, newswire (News), broadcast news (BN), broadcast conversation (BC), telephone conversation (Tele) and web data (Web) in English and Chinese and newswire data in Arabic. Also contained is English pivot text (Old Testament and New Testament text). This cumulative publication consists of 2.9 million words with counts shown in the table below.</p><br> \n<table><br> \n<tbody><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>&nbsp;</td><br> \n<td>Arabic</td><br> \n<td>English</td><br> \n<td>Chinese</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>News</td><br> \n<td>300k</td><br> \n<td>625k</td><br> \n<td>250k</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>BN</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>200k</td><br> \n<td>250k</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>BC</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>200k</td><br> \n<td>150k</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>Web</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>300k</td><br> \n<td>150k</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>Tele</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>120k</td><br> \n<td>100k</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n<tr><br> \n<td>Pivot</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>n/a</td><br> \n<td>300</td><br> \n</tr><br> \n</tbody><br> \n</table><br> \n<p>&nbsp;</p><br> \n<p>The OntoNotes project built on two time-tested resources, following the <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penn Treebank</a> for syntax and the <a href=\"http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2004T14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penn PropBank</a> for predicate-argument structure. Its semantic representation includes word sense disambiguation for nouns and verbs, with some word senses connected to an ontology, and coreference.</p><br> \n<h3>Data</h3><br> \n<p>Documents describing the annotation guidelines and the routines for deriving various views of the data from the database are included in the documentation directory of this release. The annotation is provided both in separate text files for each annotation layer (Treebank, PropBank, word sense, etc.) and in the form of an integrated relational database (ontonotes-v5.0.sql.gz) with a Python API to provide convenient cross-layer access.</p><br> \n<p>It is a known issue that this release contains some non-validating XML files. The included tools, however, use a non-validating XML parser to parse the .xml files and load the appropriate values.</p><br> \n<h3>Tools</h3><br> \n<p>This release includes OntoNotes DB Tool v0.999 beta, the tool used to assemble the database from the original annotation files. It can be found in the directory tools/ontonotes-db-tool-v0.999b. This tool can be used to derive various views of the data from the database, and it provides an API that can implement new queries or views. Licensing information for the OntoNotes DB Tool package is included in its source directory.</p><br> \n<h3>Samples</h3><br> \n<p>Please view these samples:</p><br> \n<ul><br> \n<li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2013T19.cmn.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chinese</a></li><br> \n<li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2013T19.ara.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arabic</a></li><br> \n<li><a href=\"desc/addenda/LDC2013T19.eng.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">English</a></li><br> \n</ul><br> \n<h3>Updates</h3><br> \n<p>Additional documentation was added on December 11, 2014&nbsp; and is included in downloads after that date.&nbsp;</p><br> \n<h3>Acknowledgment</h3><br> \n<p>This work is supported in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, GALE Program Grant No. HR0011-06-1-003.

Consequently, quantum resistant cryptosystems are in high demand, and lattice-based cryptosystems, based on a hard problem known as Learning With Errors (LWE), have emerged as strong contenders for standardization. In this work, we train transformers to perform modular arithmetic and combine half-trained models with statistical cryptanalysis techniques to propose SALSA: a machine learning attack on LWE-based cryptographic schemes. SALSA can fully recover secrets for small-to-mid size LWE instances with sparse binary secrets, and may scale to attack real-world LWE-based cryptosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Wenger","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingjie"},{"family":"Charton","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Lauter","given":"Kristin"}],"citation-key":"wengerSALSAAttackingLattice2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number":"935","source":"ePrint IACR","title":"SALSA: Attacking Lattice Cryptography with Transformers","title-short":"SALSA","type":"article","URL":"https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/935"},

  {"id":"widderOpenBusinessBig2023","abstract":"This paper examines ‘open’ AI in the context of recent attention to open and open source AI systems. We find that the terms ‘open’ and ‘open source’ are used in confusing and diverse ways, often constituting more aspiration or marketing than technical descriptor, and frequently blending concepts from both open source software and open science. This complicates an already complex landscape, in which there is currently no agreed on definition of ‘open’ in the context of AI, and as such the term is being applied to widely divergent offerings with little reference to a stable descriptor. So, what exactly is ‘open’ about ‘open’ AI, and what does ‘open’ AI enable? To better answer these questions we begin this paper by looking at the various resources required to create and deploy AI systems, alongside the components that comprise these systems. We do this with an eye to which of these can, or cannot, be made open to scrutiny, reuse, and extension. What does ‘open’ mean in practice, and what are its limits in the context of AI? We find that while a handful of maximally open AI systems exist, which offer intentional and extensive transparency, reusability, and extensibility– the resources needed to build AI from scratch, and to deploy large AI systems at scale, remain ‘closed’—available only to those with significant (almost always corporate) resources. From here, we zoom out and examine the history of open source, its cleave from free software in the mid 1990s, and the contested processes by which open source has been incorporated into, and instrumented by, large tech corporations. As a current day example of the overbroad and ill-defined use of the term by tech companies, we look at  ‘open’ in the context of OpenAI the company. We trace its moves from a humanity-focused nonprofit to a for-profit partnered with Microsoft, and its shifting position on ‘open’ AI. Finally, we examine the current discourse around ‘open’ AI–looking at how the term and the (mis)understandings about what ‘open’ enables are being deployed to shape the public’s and policymakers’ understanding about AI, its capabilities, and the power of the AI industry. In particular, we examine the arguments being made for and against ‘open’ and open source AI, who’s making them, and how they are being deployed in the debate over AI regulation. Taken together, we find that ‘open’ AI can, in its more maximal instantiations, provide transparency, reusability, and extensibility that can enable third parties to deploy and build on top of powerful off-the-shelf AI models. These maximalist forms of ‘open’ AI can also allow some forms of auditing and oversight. But even the most open of ‘open’ AI systems do not, on their own, ensure democratic access to or meaningful competition in AI, nor does openness alone solve the problem of oversight and scrutiny. While we recognize that there is a vibrant community of earnest contributors building and contributing to ‘open’ AI efforts in the name of expanding access and insight, we also find that marketing around openness and investment in (somewhat) open AI systems is being leveraged by powerful companies to bolster their positions in the face of growing interest in AI regulation. And that some companies have moved to embrace ‘open’ AI as a mechanism to entrench dominance, using the rhetoric of ‘open’ AI to expand market power while investing in ‘open’ AI efforts in ways that allow them to set standards of development while benefiting from the free labor of open source contributors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Widder","given":"David Gray"},{"family":"West","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Whittaker","given":"Meredith"}],"citation-key":"widderOpenBusinessBig2023","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.4543807","event-place":"Rochester, NY","genre":"SSRN Scholarly Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"language":"en","number":"4543807","publisher-place":"Rochester, NY","source":"Social Science Research Network","title":"Open (For Business): Big Tech, Concentrated Power, and the Political Economy of Open AI","title-short":"Open (For Business)","type":"article","URL":"https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4543807"},

In this article, we argue that such censoring can exacerbate discrimination by making biases more difficult to detect. We begin by detailing how computerized decisions can lead to biases in the absence of social category data and in some contexts, may even sustain biases that arise by random chance. We then show how proactively using social category data can help illuminate and combat discriminatory practices, using cases from education and employment that lead to strategies for detecting and preventing discrimination.

  {"id":"willisCreativeCriticalWriting","abstract":"In 1993, I was a graduate student in a Critical Studies Ph.D. program studying independent, avant-garde and feminist film and video, figuring out how to write about them, and thinking about what it meant to write at all. I adored high theory—the thickness of it, the heady political ambition, the philosophical complexity. But I liked zines and the wild world of alternative publishing, too, along with the community of readers eager for experiments that these publications augured. My advisors discouraged involvement with Filmmaker—a career-killer, for sure—and when I was offered a short-term job at Variety one summer, they rolled their eyes. But both Filmmaker and Variety were life changing for me, if in different ways. With Filmmaker, I learned how a single publication can help shape a culture; at Variety, I learned about subversive writing tactics. For example, I managed to slip a story about early feminist game design into a special issue on video games, and I wrote about David Blair’s Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees, now dubbed “the first film on the Internet,” in 1995! Both in fucking Variety! Sure, I was also churning out advertorial on a weekly basis, but it was thrilling to think about this kind of cultural code-switching.\n\nIt was around that time that Mark Pritchard, co-editor (with Cris Gutierrez) of the zine Frighten the Horses: A Document of the Sexual Revolution, got in touch. He wanted a piece on my hero, Kathy Acker, and I cheerfully agreed to take the assignment. I tackled a stack of Acker’s novels, dog-earring pages and underlining phrases; I perused the archive of odd publications featuring her work; and I fashioned what I thought was a damn fine piece about the fluidity of identity and subjectivity in postmodern fiction. \n\nMark sent it back. He said that not only could he not publish it, he could hardly read it. He said, “Tell me how her work makes you feel.” I was dismayed, then pissed. What I feel? Feelings had nothing to do with critical writing! I considered reneging. But it was Kathy Acker. So I tried. I started a sentence: “Kathy Acker makes me feel…” and then somehow wrote, “…like a boy.” And it began. I wrote a series of paragraphs, each of which started with “Kathy Acker makes me feel,” and the piece emerged from there. I had to admit that it was a cool way to write, tapping into something personal. It was also a little embarrassing, uncomfortable, vulnerable. I sent the piece off, hiding my queasiness with a lavish title: “Wild Dogs Howl Beneath the Gangrened Limbs of the Old: Kathy Acker’s Fucking Literature.” Mark liked it. He printed it. And Kathy Acker sent me a note shortly thereafter to say how much she enjoyed the piece. \n\nI wish I could say that I developed a brilliant writing practice informed by emotions and the body, by poetic language and rhythm, and that an auspicious career was spawned soon thereafter. But I had a dissertation to write, and after that brief foray, my writing slumped back to the turgid academese that was expected; emotion and the body dutifully squelched. \n\nI thought about the demise of that writer a lot last January when I taught my new Creative Critical Writing course to Ph.D. students in the School of Cinematic Arts at USC. The goal of the class was to treat critical writing about media with the love and care bestowed on poetry—to consider words, sentences, punctuation, rhythm, lineation, even the design of the page. The goal was also to play, to experiment and to tap into forms of knowledge generally eclipsed in an academic context.\n\nI was inspired in part by intellectual mentors who voiced a similar desire to attend to the practice of critical writing more carefully. In “The Masked Philosopher,” for example, Michel Foucault writes, “I can’t help but dream about a kind of criticism that would try not to judge but to bring an oeuvre, a book, a sentence, an idea to life; it would light fires, watch the grass grow, listen to the wind, and catch the sea foam in the breeze and scatter it.” \n\nIt would light fires!\n\nI was inspired. I decided we would meet for the class in the recently refurbished Fire Station 15 space just off campus. The week before classes began, I sent the enrolled students who had enrolled an essay by Aimee Bender titled “Light the Dark” from a book edited by Joe Fassler: titled Light the Dark: Writers on Creativity, Inspiration, and the Artistic Process, edited by Joe Fassler. The essay describes Bender’s experience with a particular poem by Wallace Stevens and her decision to memorize it. As she takes the poem into memory, she learns a bit about the power of language. She writes, “When language is treated beautifully and interestingly, it can feel good for the body: It’s nourishing. It’s rejuvenating.” She goes on to talk about her own writing practice and the way she listens and waits for mystery to help shape her sentences. “For me, the only way to find something comes through the sentence level, and sticking with the sentences that give a subtle feeling that there’s something more to say.” I wanted the students—anxious, over-worked, divorced from their creativity—to feel that sense of sustenance in language and to maybe even sense “a subtle feeling.” I asked the students to memorize a poem, and to be ready to work when they arrived on day one.\n\nThere were other inspirations as well. For example, bell hooks talks about her dismay at being taught to be a critic rather than a writer in her essay, “Remembered Rapture: Dancing With Words.” She writes, “The critic, we learned, was superior to the writer.” She continues, “We also learned that this position of superiority sanctioned dominance, that it was accorded by virtue of location, by the critical act of looking over and down on the writer.” hooks decides to refuse the position of critic, preferring to revel in language. She says, “As a writer, I seek that moment of ecstasy when I am dancing with words, moving in a circle of love so complete that like the mystical dervish who dances to be one with the Divine, I move toward the infinite.” \n\nOn the first day of class, the students arrived and milled around the large, open space of the former garage for a pair of fire trucks, chatting. I walked in and said, “Look.” They stared at me. “Look!” They began to look around nervously. “Look. Look at the space around you. Move.” They quietly put their things down and began to look around, at the floor, the ceiling. I walked more briskly, saying over and over, “Look.” \n\nThe whole thing was mortifying to me, but this is an exercise used by Joan Scheckel as part of The Technique, which she created for guiding people to experience a profound sense of self, and it is riveting when she leads it. In it, the group shifts from studying the space, to looking at each other and then engaging in an extended eye-to-eye stare while being encouraged to stay open, to receive the look of another. For my students and me, the exercise was intense and awful and yet totally awesome. We lasted about 30 minutes—and in the process, we began to reclaim the act of looking, which is central to our practice as writers. I took it as a great sign that only one student subsequently dropped the class. \n\nOver the course of the semester, we studied everything from Avital Ronell’s The Telephone Book, designed like a phone book, to Lydia Davis’s “Foucault and Pencil” and Tisa Bryant’s brilliant, deadpan depiction of racism in film in Unexplained Presence. The reading list was vast and included Susan Sontag, Joan Didion, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Maggie Nelson, Gary Indiana, Hollis Frampton, Susan Howe, Bhanu Kapil, Paul Preciado, Wayne Koestenbaum, Lia Purpura, Chang-Rae Lee, Eileen Myles, Michel Serres, Hélène Cixous, Gaston Bachelard, Claudia Rankine, Erin Manning and many, many others. We read creative nonfiction and poetry, hybrid critical writing that attends to language, and creative writing that references theory. We thought about text as texture; about writing that takes up space; the intersection of cinema and the word; a haptics of writing; the launch and the swerve; openings and endings. And we watched typography in motion, listened to audio and voice experiments, meditated in gallery spaces, moved our bodies like punctuation marks and generally tried to disrupt the academic writing practices that demand logic, order and coherence.\n\nAnd the students wrote brilliant, beautiful, weird pieces, and they used all kinds of media. One piece was an essay on a single sheet of paper about 22 feet long, with lines of letters making words in long strips\n\nl\n\ni\n\nk\n\ne \n\nt\n\nh\n\ni\n\ns.\n\nYou had to bend in half over the page and shuffle backwards down the length of the paper to read it, piecing the words together to make sense. Another student made an audio recording of her voice and the scratching of a pen to reflect on the censored voices of women in Iran. Someone rewrote the work of Maurice Blanchot using a substitution technique. Another, inspired by the Oulipo group, wrote a very strange essay, strange because it lacked the letter “e.” Another embedded a scathing critique of filmmaking in the borrowed form of a screenplay. Someone shared “notes” written on her phone during the week with the rest of the class in a kind of public/private performative writing. Another student pulled a single frame for every minute in a feature film that she is obsessed with, and wrote a brief essay for each. There were poems and prose poems, Tumblrs and Twines with nonlinear pathways through fields of words. If this sounds gimmicky, it wasn’t. The act of writing playfully but studiously investigated form and voice and attended to the tangle of authority, point of view and pleasure; in addition, the students were incredibly generous and enthusiastic readers of the work produced. \n\nThere is so much more to say about a burgeoning community of writers passionate about a reinvigorated arts writing practice. Arts writing programs in colleges and universities are growing in number, and many academics—known for their critical acumen—are publishing work that attends very creatively to language and form. I am thinking of Lauren Berlant and Kathleen Stewart’s work-in-progress titled “The Hundreds,” in which each piece is either 100 words or a multiple of 100 words. “What’s a concept or a theory if they’re no longer seen as a truth effect, but a training in absorption, attention, and framing?” the authors ask. Claudia Rankine’s groundbreaking Citizen: An American Lyric, a devastating examination of racism that melds poetry, essay and images, demonstrated just how powerful hybrid forms can be, and Rankine’s collaborative video projects were yet another inspiration for the class. Finally, Johanna Drucker recently published Downdrift: An Eco-Fiction, which is a novel that allows the UCLA professor to explore the impact of humans on the earth through fiction rather than traditional critical writing. Taken together, all of these projects join a longer history of practices that entangle creative and critical, blurring boundaries and devoting overt attention to the relationships among idea, form, voice and rhythm in the process. \n\nDespite the flurry of terms and the proliferation of exhilarating examples all around us, the starting point for our class was simple. It was Mark Pritchard’s imperative: “Write about how the work makes you feel.” That alone is enough to propel thinking and writing—thinking through writing, writing through thinking—for at least a semester!","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Willis","given":"Holly"}],"citation-key":"willisCreativeCriticalWriting","container-title":"Filmmaker Magazine","language":"en-US","title":"Creative Critical Writing","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://filmmakermagazine.com/105438-creative-critical-writing/"},
  {"id":"willisFastForwardFuture2016","abstract":"Cinema, the primary vehicle for storytelling in the twentieth century, is being reconfigured by new media in the twenty-first. Terms such as \"worldbuilding,\" \"virtual reality,\" and \"transmedia\" introduce new methods for constructing a screenplay and experiencing and sharing a story. Similarly, 3D cinematography, hypercinema, and visual effects require different modes for composing an image, and virtual technology, motion capture, and previsualization completely rearrange the traditional flow of cinematic production. What does this mean for telling stories? Fast Forward answers this question by investigating a full range of contemporary creative practices dedicated to the future of mediated storytelling and by connecting with a new generation of filmmakers, screenwriters, technologists, media artists, and designers to discover how they work now, and toward what end. From Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin's exploration of VR spherical filmmaking to Rebeca Méndez's projection and installation work exploring climate change to the richly mediated interactive live performances of the collective Cloud Eye Control, this volume captures a moment of creative evolution and sets the stage for imagining the future of the cinematic arts.","author":[{"family":"Willis","given":"Holly"}],"citation-key":"willisFastForwardFuture2016","ISBN":"978-0-231-85097-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8]]},"page":"224 Pages","publisher":"Wallflower Press","source":"Columbia University Press","title":"Fast Forward: The Future(s) of the Cinematic Arts","title-short":"Fast Forward","type":"book"},

Intimacy has emerged in feminist and queer scholarship as a rubric to depict how regimes of power shape relations and identification, particularly through the operations of discursive norms. This essay proposes that infrastructure offers another rubric for excavating material-symbolic assemblages that embed intimate relations in fields of power. Infrastructure refers to systems for transport, energy, water, and communication, but also more generally to networks that enable movement or activity, a definition that includes physical, immaterial, and regulatory elements. The emergence of critical studies of infrastructure makes this domain amenable to feminist and queer analysis. The essay introduces this work on infrastructure, explaining the merits of infrastructure as rubric and object for understanding the intimate operations of power.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Ara"}],"citation-key":"wilsonInfrastructureIntimacy2016","container-title":"Signs","ISSN":"0097-9740","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"247-280","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Infrastructure of Intimacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26552814","volume":"41"},
  {"id":"wilsonPsychosomaticFeminismNeurological2004","abstract":"How can scientific theories contribute to contemporary accounts of embodiment in the humanities and social sciences? In particular, how does neuroscientific research facilitate new approaches to theories of mind and body? Feminists have frequently criticized the neurosciences for biological reductionism, yet, Elizabeth A. Wilson argues, neurological theories—especially certain accounts of depression, sexuality, and emotion—are useful to feminist theories of the body. Rather than pointing toward the conventionalizing tendencies of the neurosciences, Wilson emphasizes their capacity for reinvention and transformation. Focusing on the details of neuronal connections, subcortical pathways, and reflex actions, she suggests that the central and peripheral nervous systems are powerfully allied with sexuality, the affects, emotional states, cognitive appetites, and other organs and bodies in ways not fully appreciated in the feminist literature. Whether reflecting on Simon LeVay’s hypothesis about the brains of gay men, Peter Kramer’s model of depression, or Charles Darwin’s account of trembling and blushing, Wilson is able to show how the neurosciences can be used to reinvigorate feminist theories of the body.","author":[{"family":"Wilson","given":"Elizabeth A."}],"citation-key":"wilsonPsychosomaticFeminismNeurological2004","ISBN":"978-0-8223-8638-4","issued":{"literal":"-05-26 2004"},"language":"en","publisher":"Duke University Press","title":"Psychosomatic: Feminism and the Neurological Body","type":"book"},

This is the main question that our research project will aim to tackle. By first defining what exactly is meant with public interest, and which factors are particularly important in this context, we will then apply this knowledge to developing new prototypes.\n\nOur prototypes will be based on three different areas of AI. One project will use automatic image recognition technologies to help identify wheelchair-accessible locations, whilst a second project will examine how Natural Language Processing tools can be applied to decrease the level of text complexity. A third project will analyse what role design plays in creating public interest AI. \n\nBy working with external partners to ensure that our AI prototypes do actually serve the public interest, we will be able to continually adjust which factors are most important and provide empirical evidence for our best practice guidelines for developing public interest AI. \n\nIn this webinar, we will give a short presentation on our various projects and also touch upon the various perspectives that are important when approaching such a research question.

  {"id":"wissingerWearableTechBodies2017","abstract":"New forms of wearable technology are blurring the lines between technology and bodies, raising questions about personhood, selfhood, and what it means to be human. Consequently, scholars are examining these iterations of body/machine interface and human machine communication from a variety of angles. While fashion scholars focused primarily on garments and celebrating potential techno-futures, media and communication scholars more critically examined how wearable tech mediates bodies and relationships. Social scientists are concerned with issues of labor, privacy, data ownership, and value, drawing on ethnographic studies of the Quantified Self (QS) community and the phenomenon of self-tracking more generally. This scholarship is rooted in studies and theorizations of ubiquitous computing, feminist science and technology studies (STS), and fashion and dress as both ornament and second skin. Generally, it asks how wearable technology can augment the human body, how it affects human relationships to self and other, and whether wearable technology can promote human autonomy, when it is locked into commercial and power relationships that don't necessarily have the users' best interests at heart. The essay ends by briefly outlining of directions for further research, urging further investigation into wearable tech exhibiting gendered attitudes toward “femme” women, and calling for increased attention to issues raised by wearable technology's coming merger with the growing fields of biotech and synthetic biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Wissinger","given":"Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"wissingerWearableTechBodies2017","container-title":"Sociology Compass","DOI":"10.1111/soc4.12514","ISSN":"1751-9020","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","page":"e12514","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Wearable tech, bodies, and gender","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/soc4.12514","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"woodrowwilsonbledsoeFacialRecognitionProject1963","abstract":"These two studies constitute the first known attempt to implement a system to perform computerized facial recognition.\nBoth are authored by Dr. Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe for Panaromic Research, Inc, and addressed for submission to The King-Hurley Research Group. Importantly, the King-Hurley Research group was a front organization for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1955 to 1969, according to Bill Richards, staff writer for the Washington Post in his May 12th 1978 article, \"Firm's Suits Against CIA Shed Light on Clandestine Air Force\". That the King-Hurley Research Group was a CIA front is also affirmed by Christopher Robbins in his 1979 book, \"The Invisible Air Force\" (1979 Mcmillion London Ltd, page 65).   \nThe first report, ‘A PROPOSAL FOR A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SIMPLIFIED FACE RECOGNITION MACHINE’, dated 30 January 1963, aims to evaluate whether it is possible using existing technology to create a machine which can reliably solve a simplified face recognition problem: using only pictures from a single view (e.g. same angle &amp; perspective) as well as high resolution pictures, identify the identity or a person from a picture that is not known to the machine.\nThe second report, ‘FACIAL RECOGNITION PROJECT REPORT’, includes the first report in its March 6th 1964 submission, and covers the expanded ambitions of the project to the more complex facial recognition problem: recognize a person's identity from novel photographs taken from multiple angles and differing lighting conditions. The report concludes that “picture recognition by machines for a large sample of people is beyond the state of the art of the present pattern recognition and computer technology at this time”.\nThe four 'lines of attack' carried out by the study are: developing more powerful recognition techniques for identifying the whole face at once \ndividing up the face into a sequence of parts or features, recognizing (or classifying) each of the figures, and combining the parts somehow for a recognition of the whole \npartitioning the categories in such a way that at any one time the machine is required to make decisions between only two (or a few) super categories. For example, the machine might first decide whether the person is male or female, then decide whether the person is Oriental or not, etc \nPreprocessing of the pictures to eliminate non-essential variability before the recognition process began.The report includes a number of charts, graphs and photographic plates which, while quite degraded by photocopying, have legible and useful notation. This is particularly explanatory with regards to Bledsoe's discussion of rotating and transforming the angle of a picture to take into account a photographic angle that is different than the reference image.\nCopies of the reports were tracked to an off-site storage facility for the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History of the University of Texas at Austin in 2012 and 2013.\n\nAlso of note: the CIA rejected a FOIA request issued to them in 2014, stating it could neither confirm nor deny their existence or nonexistence, citing various national security exceptions, while the FBA and NSA performed FOI searches and found no related documents  However in 1978 Bill Richard wrote an article that showed how the King-Hurley Research Group was a shell company operated as a front for the CIA to purchase and sell small aircraft in his Washington Post article “Firm's Suits Against CIA Shed Light on Clandestine Air Force“. \nJustine Lange (aka Justin Lange) was a graduate student at NYU ITP in 2011 when they first became interested in finding and publishing this research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,14]]},"author":[{"literal":"Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe"}],"citation-key":"woodrowwilsonbledsoeFacialRecognitionProject1963","contributor":[{"literal":"Justine Lange"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1963",1]]},"language":"eng","license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/","source":"Internet Archive","title":"A Facial Recognition Project Report","type":"book","URL":"http://archive.org/details/firstfacialrecognitionresearch"},

In this foreseeable future, learning and remembering the number of different languages and conventions that such a scientist would have to know will require significant effort---much greater than that now required to learn the conventions of his local computing center (where other users and knowledgeable assistance is readily available).

It is thus important to study the organisational structures and communication dynamics of these groups to provide insight into why they have been successful in recruiting members and how they further spread and normalise misogynistic beliefs. One such misogynistic group is MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). This study seeks to understand the structure and content of discussion within the forum of the official MGTOW website. To do so, it undertakes a content analysis of comments (n = 1012) inspired by Freelon’s (2010, 2015) multi-norm approach to studying online communication, which draws on the liberal individual, communitarian and deliberative models. It also assesses the broader patterns of commenting (n = 628,745) participation amongst users (n = 33,863). The results suggest that debates on the forum combine elements of each communicative approach and that this reflects a contradiction in their underlying ideology of separation and individualism. In addition, it was found that topics of conversation primarily focused on two topics: women (the majority of which unfold in a misogynistic way) and defining MGTOW – both as a collective identity and a personal journey.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Trott","given":"Verity"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Callum"}],"citation-key":"wrightPussyAinWorth2020","container-title":"Information, Communication & Society","DOI":"10.1080/1369118X.2020.1751867","ISSN":"1369-118X","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,27]]},"page":"1-18","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"‘The pussy ain’t worth it, bro’: assessing the discourse and structure of MGTOW","title-short":"‘The pussy ain’t worth it, bro’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1751867","volume":"0"},

To answer our question, we conduct qualitative thematic analysis of open-ended answers from a 2019 representative survey among Norwegians, identifying five folk theories: algorithms are confining, practical, reductive, intangible, and exploitative. We situate our analysis in relation to different application of folk theory approaches, and discuss our findings in light of emerging work on perceptions of algorithms and critiques of datafication, including the concept digital resignation. We conclude that rather than resignation, digital irritation emerges as a central emotional response, with a small but significant potential to inspire future political action against datafication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ytre-Arne","given":"Brita"},{"family":"Moe","given":"Hallvard"}],"citation-key":"ytre-arneFolkTheoriesAlgorithms2021","container-title":"Media, Culture & Society","container-title-short":"Media, Culture & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0163443720972314","ISSN":"0163-4437","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"807-824","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Folk theories of algorithms: Understanding digital irritation","title-short":"Folk theories of algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443720972314","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"yuanDecentralizedTrainingFoundation2023","abstract":"Training foundation models, such as GPT-3 and PaLM, can be extremely expensive, often involving tens of thousands of GPUs running continuously for months. These models are typically trained in specialized clusters featuring fast, homogeneous interconnects and using carefully designed software systems that support both data parallelism and model/pipeline parallelism. Such dedicated clusters can be costly and difficult to obtain. Can we instead leverage the much greater amount of decentralized, heterogeneous, and lower-bandwidth interconnected compute? Previous works examining the heterogeneous, decentralized setting focus on relatively small models that can be trained in a purely data parallel manner. State-of-the-art schemes for model parallel foundation model training, such as Megatron, only consider the homogeneous data center setting. In this paper, we present the first study of training large foundation models with model parallelism in a decentralized regime over a heterogeneous network. Our key technical contribution is a scheduling algorithm that allocates different computational \"tasklets\" in the training of foundation models to a group of decentralized GPU devices connected by a slow heterogeneous network. We provide a formal cost model and further propose an efficient evolutionary algorithm to find the optimal allocation strategy. We conduct extensive experiments that represent different scenarios for learning over geo-distributed devices simulated using real-world network measurements. In the most extreme case, across 8 different cities spanning 3 continents, our approach is 4.8X faster than prior state-of-the-art training systems (Megatron).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Binhang"},{"family":"He","given":"Yongjun"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Jared Quincy"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianyi"},{"family":"Dao","given":"Tri"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Beidi"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Percy"},{"family":"Re","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ce"}],"citation-key":"yuanDecentralizedTrainingFoundation2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.01288","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.01288","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Decentralized Training of Foundation Models in Heterogeneous Environments","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01288"},

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chiyuan"},{"family":"Bengio","given":"Samy"},{"family":"Hardt","given":"Moritz"},{"family":"Recht","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Vinyals","given":"Oriol"}],"citation-key":"zhangUnderstandingDeepLearning2017","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1611.03530","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,26]]},"number":"arXiv:1611.03530","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530"},

  {"id":"zhaoInherentTradeoffsLearning2022","abstract":"Real-world applications of machine learning tools in high-stakes domains are often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy is not entirely clear, even for the basic paradigm of classification problems. In this paper, we characterize an inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the classification setting by providing a lower bound on the sum of group-wise errors of any fair classifiers. Our impossibility theorem could be interpreted as a certain uncertainty principle in fairness: if the base rates differ among groups, then any fair classifier satisfying statistical parity has to incur a large error on at least one of the groups. We further extend this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately) fair classifiers, from the perspective of learning fair representations. To show that our lower bound is tight, assuming oracle access to Bayes (potentially unfair) classifiers, we also construct an algorithm that returns a randomized classifier that is both optimal (in terms of accuracy) and fair. Interestingly, when the protected attribute can take more than two values, an extension of this lower bound does not admit an analytic solution. Nevertheless, in this case, we show that the lower bound can be efficiently computed by solving a linear program, which we term as the TV-Barycenter problem, a barycenter problem under the TV-distance. On the upside, we prove that if the group-wise Bayes optimal classifiers are close, then learning fair representations leads to an alternative notion of fairness, known as the accuracy parity, which states that the error rates are close between groups. Finally, we also conduct experiments on real-world datasets to confirm our theoretical findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Han"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Geoffrey J."}],"citation-key":"zhaoInherentTradeoffsLearning2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1906.08386","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,3]]},"number":"arXiv:1906.08386","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Inherent Tradeoffs in Learning Fair Representations","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08386"},

  {"id":"zieglerFineTuningLanguageModels2020","abstract":"Reward learning enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to tasks where reward is defined by human judgment, building a model of reward by asking humans questions. Most work on reward learning has used simulated environments, but complex information about values is often expressed in natural language, and we believe reward learning for language is a key to making RL practical and safe for real-world tasks. In this paper, we build on advances in generative pretraining of language models to apply reward learning to four natural language tasks: continuing text with positive sentiment or physically descriptive language, and summarization tasks on the TL;DR and CNN/Daily Mail datasets. For stylistic continuation we achieve good results with only 5,000 comparisons evaluated by humans. For summarization, models trained with 60,000 comparisons copy whole sentences from the input but skip irrelevant preamble; this leads to reasonable ROUGE scores and very good performance according to our human labelers, but may be exploiting the fact that labelers rely on simple heuristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Stiennon","given":"Nisan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Tom B."},{"family":"Radford","given":"Alec"},{"family":"Amodei","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Christiano","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Irving","given":"Geoffrey"}],"citation-key":"zieglerFineTuningLanguageModels2020","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1909.08593","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,8]]},"number":"arXiv:1909.08593","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Fine-Tuning Language Models from Human Preferences","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08593"},
  {"id":"zielinskiVariationsMediaThinking2019","abstract":"<strong>A diverse, enriching volume of media analysis from a pioneering thinker in the field</strong>   Expanding on Siegfried Zielinski's groundbreaking inquiry into \"deep time\" of the media, the essays in <i>Variations on Media Thinking</i>  further the eminent media theorist's unique method of <i>expanded hermeneutics</i> , which means for him interpreting technical artifacts as essential parts of our cultural lives. Covering such topics as the televisualized \"Holocaust,\" the ubiquity of media today, the Internet, the genealogy of sound art, and history's first hacker movement, these essays further diversify Zielinski's insight into the hidden layers of media development, which he first articulated in his pioneering work <i>Deep Time of the Media</i> .   Including many previously untranslated and scarce essays, these \"written time machines\" open new lines of investigation for cultural scholars. From the automata of the Arabic-Islamic Renaissance (800-1200) to the largest and loudest techno-event ever, known as The Symphony of Sirens-which transformed Baku in 1922 into an immense music box of modern noise- <i>Variations on Media Thinking</i>  covers Zielinski's inquiries since 1975. Richly illustrated and full of provocation, brilliant insight, and fascinating research, this volume is perfect for students of media archaeology, philosophy, and technology, as well as any adventurous, rigorous thinkers engaged with culture and media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zielinski","given":"Siegfried"}],"citation-key":"zielinskiVariationsMediaThinking2019","DOI":"10.5749/j.ctvr6959d","ISBN":"978-1-5179-0708-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"Variations on Media Thinking","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctvr6959d"},

The FreeD is a hand-held digital milling device, monitored by a computer while preserving the makers freedom to manipulate the work in many creative ways. Relying on a pre-designed 3D model, the computer gets into action only when the milling bit risks the objects integrity, preventing damage by slowing down the spindle speed, while the rest of the time it allows complete gestural freedom. We present the technology and explore several interaction methodologies for carving. In addition, we present a user study that reveals how synergetic cooperation between human and machine preserves the expressiveness of manual practice. This quality of the hybrid territory evolves into design personalization. We conclude on the creative potential of open-ended procedures within this hybrid interactive territory of manual smart tools and devices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zoran","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Shilkrot","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Nanyakkara","given":"Suranga"},{"family":"Paradiso","given":"Joseph"}],"citation-key":"zoranHybridArtisansCase2014","container-title":"ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction","container-title-short":"ACM Trans.
