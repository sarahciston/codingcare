# appendices

>>In January 2019 I sent out this Google form to USC students, staff, and faculty who I thought might be interested in a new code-friendly community. This was our first document, where you can see the shape it was beginning to take and its raw edges, as I was wayfinding for what I was interested in offering and what others might need. 

## first sign up form

Want to see how MA+P PhDs approach programming as artists, not engineers, and incorporate it into their work? Frustrated with coding but want to use it in your projects? Don't know where to start? 

Come connect and create with PhDs and other undergrads interested in artistic programming. 

First meeting FRIDAY JAN 18, 1pm-4pm, SCI L106. Sign up to learn more—let us know when you're available to meet, plus what activities you want to see.

This weekly drop-in studio will focus on growth not perfection, scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, collaboration not competition. We'll offer workshops, troubleshooting, support, and snacks—and keep our structure flexible to meet the collective's needs. All levels and languages welcome!

### Schedule 
* I am available most Fridays, 1-4 pm (for at least part of that time)
* I am not available then, but still want to hear about the group (List your preferred availability below)
* Other:

### What do you want Code Collective to offer? (Add your ideas!) 
* Co-working space
* Online resource hub
* PhD-led workshops
* Student-led workshops
* Student-led drop-in tutoring
* Student-organized project showcase
* Visits to hackathons or other outside events and organizations
* Other:

### What workshops interest you? (Add your ideas!) 
* Activist Chatbots and Other Automated Agents
* Environmental Data and Sensor Networks
* Machine Learning Tactics for Artists
* Making Electronic Instruments
* Movement-Based Interaction Design
* Poetics of Regular Expressions
* Python as a Second Language
* Raspberry Pi for Tactical Media
* Visualizing Your Personal Data
* Other:

### Bonus
* What projects do you want to work on? What would keep you coming back? What skills can you share with the collective? Any fears / interests / context you want to mention? 


## departmental proposal

15 Nov 2018

Proposal: [MA+P] Code Collective

The [MA+P] Code Collective will be a space for [MAP + iMAP] students to develop their computational media practice in a flexible, collaborative setting that strengthens the Media Arts + Practice community. It supports gaining computer science skills in an engaging, non-intimidating, non-engineering environment—instead focusing on artistic strategies for learning and making with code, emphasizing criticality and experimentation. 

Code Collective draws from models like Girls Who Code, UCSD’s ICAM and Stanford’s CS+X majors, and Gene Kogan’s Machine Learning for Artists. It addresses the need in Media Arts + Practice for additional emphasis on computational media practices expressed by students. Designed as an emergent organization responsive to community needs, Code Collective will be flexible enough to support existing *[IML instruction and in-class projects (e.g. for 288, 300, 400)]*, and it will also incorporate programming languages and code practices not currently prioritized within IML curricula so that students may extend their artistic practice and professionalization. 
 
Potential components of Code Collective will include workshops led by iMAP PhD students and invited guests; student-led tutoring, coworking, and troubleshooting; online resource-sharing; and visits to local hackathons or other campus groups. Sample workshops may include Python as a second language, machine learning tools and tactics, movement-based interaction design, environmental data and sensor networks, raspberry pi for tactical media, visualizing personal data APIs, and the poetics of regular expressions. 

OBJECTIVES

Students will extend their confidence with CS skills using creative coding practices. They will develop and troubleshoot projects for courses, shows, portfolios, etc. They will also connect with each other across classes and years, and within the broader [MAP–iMAP] community.

My professional development goals in convening Code Collective include developing curriculum for future workshops, TAships, or classes—as well as building my own coding skills and developing projects and collaborations.

PRE-LAUNCH STEPS
Create google form: signup via email list, schedule standard time to book room (schedule around classes; survey students for availability and particular interests)
Create web presence/wiki/email contact; write invitation announcement; write mission
Share group invitation announcement to undergraduate lists
Identify potential undergraduate liaisons, visit code-focused courses
Set workshop schedule with PhD students
Connect with coding faculty & outside organizations

PLANNED ACTIVITIES SCHEDULE SP18
First meeting Week 2 or 3, first meeting
Weekly drop in at standard time, ~3 hours
Week 4, 7, 10: Workshops (2-4 in semester, every few weeks as needed)
Join a hackathon or engineering meetup on campus
Organize a fun event like Stupid Hackathon http://www.stupidhackathon.com/
Or join a community-conscious hackathon like Hack for LA http://www.hackforla.org/

QUESTIONS
What might I need to adapt to make this an appropriate TA position or potentially a course in the future?
Would the club need to be offered as research units for students to attend?
Thoughts on how to build in positive accountability to retain students?
Resources for outside funding from university or industry?
