<!-- # appendix -->

>>In January 2019 I sent out this Google form to USC students, staff, and faculty who I thought might be interested in a new code-friendly community. This was our first document, where you can see the shape it was beginning to take and its raw edges, as I was wayfinding for what I was interested in offering and what others might need. 

## first sign up form

Want to see how MA+P PhDs approach programming as artists, not engineers, and incorporate it into their work? Frustrated with coding but want to use it in your projects? Don't know where to start? 

Come connect and create with PhDs and other undergrads interested in artistic programming. 

First meeting FRIDAY JAN 18, 1pm-4pm, SCI L106. Sign up to learn more—let us know when you're available to meet, plus what activities you want to see.

This weekly drop-in studio will focus on growth not perfection, scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code, collaboration not competition. We'll offer workshops, troubleshooting, support, and snacks—and keep our structure flexible to meet the collective's needs. All levels and languages welcome!

### Schedule
