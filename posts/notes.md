Pirate Care on sus- not sur-
>"We need to see digital resources as occasions for building mutualism, collective learning and radical pedagogies on the terms of those who are invisible, vulnerable and discriminated against." (Pirate Care. [“Care in a Techno-Capitalist World.”](https://dingdingding.org/issue-3/care-in-a-techno-capitalist-world/) Ding Magazine.)

>"What’s needed is not something out of science fiction — it’s regulation, empowerment of ordinary people and empowerment of workers." (Bender, E. M. (2022, April 18). On NYT Magazine on AI: Resist the Urge to be Impressed. Medium. [URL](https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/on-nyt-magazine-on-ai-resist-the-urge-to-be-impressed-3d92fd9a0edd))

>"Find the wounded places in your community, where thinking and action are stagnant—bring the medicine of imagination." (brown, a.m. ["Dream Beyond the Wounds"](https://dingdingding.org/issue-2/dream-beyond-the-wounds/) Ding Magazine.)

Randy Bass would call this a "high-impact practice" in "co-curriculum" (via Holly). 
>"These practices also have high impact because they induce, according to George Kuh, student behaviors that lead to meaningful learning gains. The important student behaviors include the following: 
    Investing time and effort
    Interacting with faculty and peers about substantive matters
    Experiencing diversity
    Responding to more frequent feedback
    Reflecting and integrating learning
    Discovering relevance of learning through real-world application

And Bass points to Henry Jenkins' participatory cultures, which have...
>"* Low barriers to entry
    Strong support for sharing one’s contributions
    Informal mentorship, from experienced to novice
    A sense of connection to each other
    A sense of ownership in what is being created
    A strong collective sense that something is at stake"

Bass suggests to bring this impact into the classroom and "design for greater fluidity and connection between the formal curriculum and the experiential co-curriculum."

>"we start in practice["learning to be"], and practice drives us to content ["learning about"]. Or, more likely, the optimal way to learn is reciprocally or spirally between practice and content." 


*I like that, learn "spirally between practice and content," learning about and learning to be.*

Also, while the need to quote from the original source for accuracy seems plain enough to me, I don't much care for the way it erases the path by which you found that source, the work that author in the middle put in tracking it down, synthesizing it, and helping it contribute to my thinking. I wish there were a better way to cite that was celebration not excavation and accolades.

showing the roughest zero drafts of this to a few trusted people has been affirming. normally I wouldn't show anything quite so unrealized, in order to protect its spark, but in this case its spark has been getting lots of tending from lots of places. 

also it brought up some thoughts about tone, the guide feels more vibrant and lively and this quote I subsequently came across explains why perhaps:

>"a manifesto is only ever a document that reaches too far, that speculates too impossibly, and that the only use a manifesto can have is to lay bare why it cannot be manifested, to open itself to all the ways its un-manifestation shapes the world and is its very foundation." (Hedva, J. 2022. ["Why It's Taking So Long"](https://www.topicalcream.org/features/why-its-taking-so-long/) Topical Cream.)

had an easy time adding Bindery.js tool to this minimalist Jekyll + Github pages setup, which affirms my (not) gut instinct for minimalism somewhat. even though I want everything to have all the moving parts and bells and whistles, anne lamont says "bird by bird" and it's easier to see the interconnectedness of things, each tree in the forest, when each part is tall and strong and simple and can move on its own. 

I sunk this week in an application it turns out I'm not eligible to apply for. But in it I wrote about simple tools: The _Anarchist’s Tool Chest_ says there is power in a small set of tools, known intimately and carried easily. Its author Christopher Schwarz calls this "a radical and rare idea that can help change the world." This idea is missing from AI tools, which require massive technical knowhow and financial resources to operate.

The work done with Intersectional AI Toolkit and Creative Code Collective both argues that anyone should be able to understand the key tools of technology and should have the power to reimagine the systems that impact them most.

affirming that everything is better when we're in it together, I shared my worthless feelings with code collective and we commiserated that no one ever fully moves past the coding aches and pains, ebbs and flows. that heroku dynos are haaaaard. sometimes everything is hard. some weeks are bursts of productivity and sometimes everything is a struggle. miraculously, strangely, the antidote to shame may be live coding on the big screen as your friends help you talk through your problem. and also we celebrated a win tonight as one of our anchor members heard great news and will be moving on, potentially starting a new CCC chapter at another university. this will be such an adventure to discuss remotely how the wild experiment of our collective might be replicated and remixed and i'm so excited to see how we might rhizome out into the world, while also sad to lose our unique little magic pod which cheered me up so much tonight.

ever have one of those days where nothing works and you just keep trying and still nothing works? until you start to doubt your own ability to do even simple tasks because when you try to switch gears to do something simpler to make yourself feel better even that doesn't work? I can't seem to stop and it doesn't help. It sucks to feel like there's no solution to the seemingly easy problems I am trying to solve with code, which is why I started code collective in the first place, and I'm feeling exactly like I don't want people to feel about coding in general and machine learning specifically.

challenges of the web3/semantics at large: vastness, vagueness, uncertainty, inconsistency, deceit
a semantic web layer cake
the desire to be understood by machines, to be held by database

### 03 oct 21, "making things, practicing emptiness"

what form should the final object take? "final" "form" "object" 
after Berlin I am really into (the idea of) making again. seeing the material of the zines be the part of the Intersectional AI Toolkit that comes alive for folks. to want to reorient practice around materials and people. less around the arguments and ideas than the ineffables (immaterial) that can be conjured through the stuff stuff. it probably needs to be a small edition of book/s  

### 02 jul 21, critical-creative approach & the lyric code essay

who is writing this hybrid? there's the lyric essay from the creative writing side but where is this represented from the scholarly side, that vulnerability? Alexis Pauline Gumbs is the example I can think of, adrienne marie brown—and a few innovative folks holding their own in both spaces... outliers, perhaps, not a blending accepted as it now is in lyric essay, not a section of academic journals per se. we have critical \_\_\_ studies, and creative \_\_\_, but little critical-creative \_\_\_. is there a case to be made for this? 

another layer to add: code. lyric code essays? lyric gif code essays and lyric data code essays? I am imagining the scholarly object that leans lyric and exposes its code layer as part of its meaning, exposes its vulnerable human and machinic modes of production and process, its desires for care and its communities of influence and impact.  

### 26 jun 21, orders of operation

questioning this flail main strategy of procrastination-fueled ways of doing. wherein i work on the third item from the top of the list of urgency. wherein i make notes and gestures of ideas and then discover them elsewhere. trying to remember there are no new ideas but also honor other people's separate synchronous efforts. just a pdf hoarder and a collector of half strategies and maybe it's nothing if i do nothing with it? this three-layered beast is definitely tentacled, repeating herself, not sure where to put things, just trying to push through and get some writing out rather than worry about tone or placement to the point of doing nothing. echoing the reminder PERFECTIONISM IS WHITE SUPREMACY. raised steeped in the stuff. therefore maybe it's my job to flail, it's part of the dismantling. or maybe it's me taking up too much space, claiming something that doesn't need to be mine? 

thinking a lot about how i would like my role to be harmonizer, facilitator, space holder, platform maker, i don't want the hustle i want the play and collective encouragement and support. not sure how much is fear. the physical therapist says i literally am not making space in my ribcage and thorax when i breathe. like it's all escaping up my crooked chest, that wasted air, this wet noodle core not trying to hold myself up but hoping to hold others. thinking of the codes we might rewrite with our bodies and the bodies we can recode and welcome with our codes. 

### 31 may 21, disappeared

lately mourning depreciation of tools, dependencies, the way time organically breaks down the elements I taped together rickety carefully, to create something. I came to write this down to expand on later and found my organization frenzy missed copying documents over and lost the entirety of this document, starting again blank. sometimes mourning is a  carcass of a project's broken link, sometimes it is a blankness. i didn't git commit enough, i toggled between calling this notes and _notes and there is no perfect system for keeping everything and even if there were it would keep us from seeing anything, the map cannot be the territory or else useless. 
i think all that was lost was yesterday's attempt to write about the 34th attempt to find a perfect platform, and some reorganized notes from prior attempts. how to be okay with all the tiny losses along the way? Elizabeth Bishop never quite answered that one for us.

### 27 apr 21, process

requires a starting point, a leap into the middle, warp and weft. Maria said start at the very beginning but it's too late for that, and trying to fake a perfect very beginning has got me all muddled in the performance of process instead of showing its actual messiness, its seams. And so it seems important first to discuss the ways I've been unable to start, leaping from platform to platform, behind the scenes, learning again and again how to start—just so, so that it's perfect, so that you (who?) will love what is said (me) and everything will be (different?), language being executable and all, speech acts—

I am in the thick of it. Searching for the perfect way, forgetting that perfectionism is white supremacy and the most important learning is unlearning. Here I am trying to find new forms, wayfinding.
