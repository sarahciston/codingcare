### 26.06.21, orders of operation

questioning this flail main strategy of procrastination-fueled ways of doing. wherein i work on the third item from the top of the list of urgency. wherein i make notes and gestures of ideas and then discover them elsewhere. trying to remember there are no new ideas but also honor other people's separate synchronous efforts. just a pdf hoarder and a collector of half strategies and maybe it's nothing if i do nothing with it? this three-layered beast is definitely tentacled, repeating herself, not sure where to put things, just trying to push through and get some writing out rather than worry about tone or placement to the point of doing nothing. echoing the reminder PERFECTIONISM IS WHITE SUPREMACY. raised steeped in the stuff. therefore maybe it's my job to flail, it's part of the dismantling. or maybe it's me taking up too much space, claiming something that doesn't need to be mine? 

thinking a lot about how i would like my role to be harmonizer, facilitator, space holder, platform maker, i don't want the hustle i want the play and collective encouragement and support. not sure how much is fear. the physical therapist says i literally am not making space in my ribcage and thorax when i breathe. like it's all escaping up my crooked chest, that wasted air, this wet noodle core not trying to hold myself up but hoping to hold others. thinking of the codes we might rewrite with our bodies and the bodies we can recode and welcome with our codes. 

### 31.05.21, disappeared

lately mourning depreciation of tools, dependencies, the way time organically breaks down the elements I taped together rickety carefully, to create something. I came to write this down to expand on later and found my organization frenzy missed copying documents over and lost the entirety of this document, starting again blank. sometimes mourning is a  carcass of a project's broken link, sometimes it is a blankness. i didn't git commit enough, i toggled between calling this notes and _notes and there is no perfect system for keeping everything and even if there were it would keep us from seeing anything, the map cannot be the territory or else useless. 
i think all that was lost was yesterday's attempt to write about the 34th attempt to find a perfect platform, and some reorganized notes from prior attempts. how to be okay with all the tiny losses along the way? Elizabeth Bishop never quite answered that one for us.

### 27.04.21, process
requires a starting point, a leap into the middle, warp and weft. Maria said start at the very beginning but it's too late for that, and trying to fake a perfect very beginning has got me all muddled in the performance of process instead of showing its actual messiness, its seams. And so it seems important first to discuss the ways I've been unable to start, leaping from platform to platform, behind the scenes, learning again and again how to start—just so, so that it's perfect, so that you (who?) will love what is said (me) and everything will be (different?), language being executable and all, speech acts—

I am in the thick of it. Searching for the perfect way, forgetting that perfectionism is white supremacy and the most important learning is unlearning. Here I am trying to find new forms, wayfinding.
