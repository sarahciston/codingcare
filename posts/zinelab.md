## zine club

During Spring 2022, MA+P Zine Club meets weekly at USC in SCI 211, *Wednesdays 4-6 PM* 

First rule of Zine Club is what happens in Zine Club gets shared widely and enjoyed! *Join Us!* (Pssst... We're also a knitting club.) 

## zine lab & lounge

The Coding Care Zine Lab & Lounge will be a cozy creative space to share thoughts on technology through writing, drawing, making, and coding zines. Read works from the Intersectional AI Toolkit, MA+P Zine Club and friends, plus contribute your own. We all have skills to teach each other.

Come hang out on *29 Apr 2022, 6PM Onward* ðŸ’œ
