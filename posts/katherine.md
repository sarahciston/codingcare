first impressions? Wow, so long ago? This is probably back in like maybe freshman year, like Freshman Spring or something. I saw a poster or email that mentioned code collective and there's an email that I could email and I guess it was you. Or no. I think it was a for a Google format. first. So I signed up, and then I came to the first meeting.

And I was curious. I wish i'd remember what the what the form had said, but it was something about like creative coding, and I was like, I don't know what i'm gonna do yet. But that sounds really close to what I want to do. They came. There were lots of different people from many disciplines. And we just talked about what we were interested in, and had, like some discussions about like creative ways to use code. 
And that was a really exciting first meeting for me, and then for a while kind of dropped off, because I think I can fit fit in my schedule, or I think, at one point I was like I can make the meetings but now, but but I've like already missed so many that I feel really awkward going back because I felt like I didn't really know anybody, and I didn't want to like barge back in. I didn't know like what necessarily the culture was so I wish I had gone back. I could have had more meetings but at some point I started coming back, and became a regular and then like more and more.

I felt like, Oh, it's like not just like something that Sarah's leading, but also like we're all part of this club, and like we can sort of like talk about whatever we want to it's like what we make of it A. And so now like to me, **the club is like something that's like our home for like discussing and sharing and doing creative code things together**. and it's just like a really positive and safe and exciting environment to be in. 

_Do you know what the things were that let you know that you could make it your own?_

I think it's definitely like the tone that you set of like, I feel like these are things that you you said over and over again. That it's like it's not something it's not like you're you know, like the teacher and like for the students, and like you there's like a like a schedule for each session but it's more like we group of like-minded people who all have things to learn from each other, and cool things that we're working on. 
And so like I feel like it's like natural when you go and you talk to other people. You're like Oh, that's so cool that you're doing so and so like I want to learn more and then the it sort of naturally evolves from there.

**Collective is a collaborative co-working co-learning place for people who are curious about code or are curious about creative ways to use code or code-y ways to be creative. And it's a very welcoming environment, and there's a lot, though we can come and learn together.**

Creative code collective: Come code collaboratively
Okay, all the although, like Co. **the prefix is, is really feels really relevant, like collating, co-working, collaborating just doing things together.**

>what are the essential part essential components of code collective, what parts are important to you like, technically, socially, emotionally, collaboratively, artistically, politically, what makes it what makes it go vroom

**I think the snacks are definitely a big jaw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid. I think the the fact that we all like making each other feel like we're all an equal part of the community in terms of, we all have stuff to share, even if it's not like products that we're working on. We have like opinions about things, and we can offer opinions on each other's projects or answers to questions.**

So I think that's really good and in in circumstances where it's like, I think something that I've noticed is like sometimes people who aren't as vocal or proactive in speaking up because I feel like so, sometimes where i'm like like, Other people will be like here's just like out of the blue like, "Here's a project that I'm working on, check it out, it's so cool." And then sort of my my instinct in a lot of situations is I won't necessarily speak, unless asked about it, which I try to be more proactive sometimes, but sometimes that is what I fall back on.

**And so the culture of encouraging each other, and like proactively asking after each other, I think has been really helpful for me.** In terms of asking each other, "What have you been working on, or what do you think of this?" Even when that person isn't necessarily the first to speak up 

'''
<<XXX>>
_or answer to say like proactively asking after each other, I like that._
'''

>>I like that I don't think that that's something that I would like consciously built in, or it felt affected at first. But it really it feels really important it's kind of my favorite part of the meeting.

Now, it always kind of **turns into the whole meeting like there's never a point where it's not that we just sort of unconsciously segue into the troubleshooting of one of the things that people share, yeah show and tell.**

>How would you describe the code collective approach to coding? Does the working, teaching, learning, making style feel different in any way?

Yeah, I feel like I don't I feel like i'm still thinking about this a lot because I feel like by this point we've kind of collected a bunch of regulars. But the regulars that come at this point are people who are more comfortable with code.

I would say and are always working on it project and usually like comfortable with whatever technology that we're talking about, or at least familiar with it or heard of it.

Have some kind of connect, like understanding of how to connect to it. That kind of thing. 

I don't know if, like we haven't been sort of making enough space for people who are more beginners. So I'm still thinking about that. 

But **I think the idea of it has always been to create a space where you don't have to know everything. And it's not like class where you come and you're everyone's working towards one point, and how good you are is it is defined by how well you know the technology, how well you can do something.** Because, the club is like inherently multidisciplinary, so people will have different strengths, a different background. And so **we'll be working with different things. and we'll come with different assumptions about things,** and so the idea is we can <<XXX>> by sort of co-learning and co-working.

We can offer our own unique perspectives. and then, like certifying joy in like the process of like learning, and like going through the journey together. <<XXX Who said this?>>

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah, yeah, I Yeah. I think The The goal is always to work towards a culture of encouraging scrappy code.

**And being okay with not being the best at every tool in technology.**

<<ME>>
>>**The approach is that it is possible to learn any part of it. We're not gonna come in knowing everything we're not gonna leave knowing everything either.Everybody comes in with the expectation of capacity, like even if somebody comes in cold, we are welcoming in the sense of like Oh, it's really cool that you want to know that and like, let's help you figure it out, or even if it's somebody who's a regular, and is very adapt a lot of languages, they might be tackling something that is new to them and approach is same. Like: I don't know these like fragment shaders but and it's super confusing, but I'm gonna approach it with the same attitude, like eventually I'm gonna figure out this problem.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000<<XXX>>
So it's sort of yeah, not her that we the level that approaches the same.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Yeah, Yeah, I think that's true. maybe I would also add in my answer that **we encourage curiositya and self startership.** Yeah, Well, I guess I guess back to my original, like hesitation about the beginners thing is that I feel like we have had a lot of people come by, even if it was just once but they were like I don't know anything about code. but what you're doing sounds really exciting and then they hang out, and they learn couple of like big ideas about like what's going on. And even if it's not something that, like an environment they would want to come back to regularly, just because it's like not necessarily in their wheelhouse, which is totally fine, like **just by having this space of of discovery and co-learning, we can show people even just passersby that this is a kind of thing that you can explore.**

>>Yeah, I love that. Yeah. and I think we we're still practicing like not steamrolling people with our excitement.But about being like, let me show you how to do this in like, you know. yeah, E7 script and Python list comprehensions. Let me show you the most efficient, like tight, nerdy way to express it like, Let me show you the concept or get you excited about it. 

>What is the spirit of code collective, and what are values? What kinds of things would you include in like our manifesto, or how? And then how do we demonstrate or embody those values?

I think, like the spirit is curiosity, excitement, piggybacking off a couple of things.

You just said curiosity, excitement, there's a certain sense of like vulnerability in there, where it's like you don'tâ€”It's not like you're showing off to each other sometimes it's like it's like showing off but it's like in a way that you're like you I struggle to I struggle through this to make this thing that I'm really proud of and there's it's not a sense of competition, because nobody's working on the same thing. But it's more of like I made this really cool thing that I'm really proud of, and I really want to show you guys and talk about like how we can better support... We can support each other and encourage each other and things like that.
<<WHO?>>
So yeah curiosity, excitement, vulnerability. Community. collaboration. Yeah, I think hopefully, like a lot of the words that were mentioned in the previous question.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000
>Are there specific ways you think that we like embody those or put them forward that share not to you.

**I really like the the times that we troubleshoot problems and projects, because then it really shows not everyone knows everything, and we all have things to learn from each other and teach each other.**

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000<<WHAT?>>
And through that process of I feel like I troubleshooting.

That seems to be really successful when you've done them because first of all, **just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do.**

**But then also, like other people, will have different perspectives. and also just kind of having that space to like work through it together, like having the time to like sit down and be like, Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code, and then getting to different steps and like going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through.**

>Yeah, yeah, I know, like last week, when I was feeling completely like obliterated. It really helped me to just like talk through. Yeah, But even though I felt like my problem was stupid, and I'd already thought through it alone in exactly the same way as I was even like tired of explaining it because I had explained it to myself in my head. It made something through it out loud, and I left feeling much better than I came in. 

And even if you like, there's no there isn't a problem, the problem isn't solved there is still a sense of like validation and support that you get just from being the vent to somebody that was helpful.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:30.000
>Yeah, has creative code collective affected how you engage with Code in general, or as a creative critical practice like what has shifted for you about how you work.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I think the first thing that comes to mind is that it's a huge source of inspiration from like the things that we the things that we show each other about, like what we're working on. But also the resources that we drop in the chat. The things that we look at during our meetings. I mean the world of creative coding is so big, and there's always so much to explore, and you always find things every day that you never would have thought of. Another thing that comes to mind is like, Now I think now that I like how built up connections with a bunch of the people in the club I have a sense of each, because each person has their own background in their own specialties, or their things that they're interested in. **I feel like I have like a network of resources almost like if i'm working on.** If I venture into like web VR for example I know Okay, I can ask Samir if I have problems.

<<CHECK RECORDING>><<<<<<<<00:22:40.000 --> 00:23:09.000>>>>>>>>>
So resources are key. And And the third thing is, I guess it just keep it just is always like very encouraging to like in the <<WHAT?>> in the because, like, I think the most most of the tech world is so is is quite toxic and like Techbury,<<WHAT?>> and like on twitter you always see a lot of stuff about like you have to code this way. There's one right way to code and like like how can you be the best coder he'd be the 10 excess 100 X engineer. <<WHAT?>>

**It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like. Okay, you don't have to be that you can go in your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one but one right way to code.**

I love that. Yeah, it's really freeing or like I don't know that feels too simple. But it's really yeah, really appreciate that. 

>Do you feel like code collective has shipped it affected how you engage with code as a like a political or intersectional practice at all.

I think it's like I don't know if it's like code, collective, or you like your work.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000<<<<WHAT?>>>>
Yeah, because I think, like to Miko collective is more about the community. 
And your work is more about like definitely about community as well. But there's like an explicitly political aspect to it. So I've been really really inspired by your Intersectional AI work. In terms of thinking about code as a non-neutral, politically powerful and relevant platform.

Trying to think about like code collective I don't know. I feel like maybe there is something underlying the idea of  community and collaboration, and collaborating politically, But for me, I just like that the thing that most <<WHAT?>>meatly dump tonight is your work in intersectional AI

>>Oh, thanks. I appreciate that. I mean, I do think of the practice of making and maintaining a collective or like, I guess by that I mean just the practice of us being together, and how we do what we are doing as political it's but it is interesting to hear that code collective feels more neutral. Because I do. I do feel like our our think of our values as being more political or intersectional. But I have always wondered like how much of the sort of politics, of code, or how I think of critical coding get into people's projects. Especially as other folks are coming into the space more that aren't media arts folks, like how much is that affecting their projects?

It'll be interesting to see. There's a lot of source of discussion in the projects that we work on and encounter in the wild, like... When we first started seeing Dahzi at the meetings, I forget their pronouns. Dahzi was working on a lot of AI stuff, and we immediately started talking about like a lot of the ethics around, and and like controversy of surrounding AI and NFTs. And they were really I feel like they were quick to really jump in and join the discussion about how they were feeling. And I feel like that's a hard conversation to have or **hard to find a space somewhere else that would host those kinds of discussions. And so I feel like you probably talk a lot about, like the politics of like community and inclusion like I mean, I guess that is political.** But for me, I guess, what first came to mind was the fact that **it is a community where we can hold space for having those discussions.**

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
<<XXX>[which is a] Political thing. Yeah, Yeah, I think so, too. I appreciate that.

>But the last 3 questions on my list are: What do you like about what do you? What would you change about co- Collective? and what would you take with you from your experiences?

**What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together.**

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000
>So the community aspect of it is really important. What would I change about color collective?

**It's small and tight, and we have a bunch of regulars. but I also feel like maybe there are other people out there who were not reaching who might be interested or where we can like the community, would benefit from having them as well, we're even like not just individuals. like other organizations like, I think, the a student assembly for accessibility with having some discussions about technological accessibility.** And I was thinking about like potentially bridging that those 2 things but I know we've had this discussion a lot about like how much we want to be involved in like campus life. 
In a sense like it is nice to just be like a very low key group, or we don't have to deal with like the bureaucracy of becoming a student organization. But if there was like a way to like, get more involved without it being too much work, that might be something interesting to explore.

>What would you take with you? Yeah, what we take with you from your experiences?

It has given me a better understanding about how to talk about code. I feel like code and technology and people who engage with code and technology. In terms of like 
It's made me more curious about not just the code in the project itself, but also the process, like what you went through to get there and what are you working on. Now, how are you inspired to do this? What were some challenges that you ran into? Is there any way that I can offer any opinions or help with what <<XXX>>are we doing next? Just as a way of understanding that **all the technology that we built comes from a person or a bunch of people and they went on a journey to get there, and that journey is inherently very interesting.**

>Do you have a favorite like memory or moment from code collective?

Oh, memory I think there was one time where I was presenting this project. I'd done it, my internship where it was like like a processing project. And it featured like this ink simulation. And then I remember people were asking me how I did it. And I got to like do some whiteboarding and explain bit shifting and how to do operations in color. And I don't think I fully understand what I was saying. But it's like **a really fun experience to like to teach and learn and like teach and learn at the same time, and feel like we are all, like there wasn't any lesson, plan, or anything.** <<XXX>>You just kind of stemmed from like our own curiosities about each other, and what we were doing. And I love teaching as well personally. So that was a fairly fun time.

>I remember that day that was really fun, and I remember how, in awe of that work everyone was.
