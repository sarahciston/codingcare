[Akademie der Künste Fellow](https://www.adk.de/en/academy/young-academy/ai-anarchies/) at the JUNGE AKADEMIE of Akademie der Künste, Berlin. Six artists will develop new works on the topic "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Ethics" during a six-month residency programme at ZK/U in Berlin titled "AI Anarchies." The invited artists' projects will be shown in a final presentation between May and July 2023 at Akademie der Künste. My work is furthering the Intersectional AI Toolkit findings to imagine Intersectional AI tools for tangible, accessible machine learning.

### questions literally too big to answer but that still need to be asked
- who are the authors of the 195 billion 380 thousand 885 total words that trained GPT-3 (195,380,885,914)? 93 percent of them in English. (181,014,683,608 English words and the other 14,366,202,306 in other languages)

- what's the ML equivalent of learning network protocols for handheld radical tactical practices
