* purpose of the book, what are the rituals of programming
* who we are, who i am and why it matters
* why we're here

## 1. we know code isn't magic, but we are

>"No way, code is magic." 
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, Assistant Director, USC Ahmanson Lab

### coding rituals: what are the practices of our communities? 
Code is language, code is a tool; code can be read and learned and used to express. This guidebook wants to expand on and enrich the rituals of programming to include the joy and community and care necessary to make different kinds of code. 


>"What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

### we choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away

These small things are seeds. We don't know what they might grow into but we trust they will grow: *"Everything small and buried surrenders to a process that none of the buried parts can see."*[^nepo]

### we choose/find impossibly large things to get excited about too

It's true there's a lot to be said for the smallest viable prototype. Sure. But sometimes we can't help ourselves. We love to dream wildly. We'll figure out the impractical later and the impossible after that. Sometimes overshooting gets us where we need to go by overshooting and scaling down a bit later.

### we come from everywhere / don't always fit (all backgrounds and disciplines)

CCC is a self-organizing community of [artists, makers, and students] from all backgrounds—especially including those who have not had the chance to code before.

We come from all fields of study--media art, literature, dance, theatre, neuroscience, linguistics, mechanical engineering, physics, music, communication, and sometimes computer science--and we're never quite sure we completely belong there. We might be exceeding the bounds of what our specializations offer, what our vocabularies describe.

But when we've looked outside those spaces we have also struggled to find where we fit. Perhaps we were convinced there was no home for us, no one to understand what we were trying to do. This might sound bombastic, but rest assured, we were not sure ourselves... this was only a gut feeling, a glimmer. Something drew us toward this tinkering, until we got frustrated, kept hitting walls, kept hearing it couldn't be done or shouldn't be done, or why bother.  

[[ We come from all backgrounds, joined in a university setting, but aligned / seeing differences as strengths and opportunities to [...] ]]


[...]

As folks that come from different cultures, sexualities & genders, fields of study, most of us do not come to programming through traditional training. 

We reinforce that everyone brings skills to share and can learn from each other. 

*We are committed to interdisciplinary intersectional practices and making. We make sure this is embedded in and extends beyond our own work by including workshops and group research that focuses on algorithmic bias and other issues in computation that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally.*


### why we're here

At our first meeting, initial members cited a mix of desires: 
* "to learn what language is used for what"
* "not to be intimidated to try something new"
* "see what others do, have a set time to work on projects and keep skills sharp"
* "not to check the assigned boxes but find an artistic approach. make stuff"
* "ask questions"
* "see others projects and help"
* "see weird projects and find interesting solutions"
* "have an accountability space and a brain trust with shared expertise"
* "conquer my trouble starting and finishing. bounce ideas off of others. build something I'm proud of"

Each person shared what they were currently working on, some topics they knew about, some topics they wanted to know about. We looked for the overlaps.



### we are still figuring out who we are

We gather as part of this effort, and we have started to trust each other with the care and feeding required to take on this continual work. We reveal ourselves, maybe slowly at first. By sharing the things we make or want to make, we share what we care about, who we care for, our politics. We get glimpses of each others homes and families and pets. We see each other chew with our mouths full or sweaty on arrival or frustrated to figure out a problem.  

## 2. we make room for each other

>"It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like, "Okay, you don't have to be that, you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code."**
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

### ...and we ask after each other

### we meet regularly

weekly if possible, in person if possible, and we accommodate what's not always possible. We're flexible to the impossible and know we'll get back to it later. Like old friends you can pick up with after an indeterminate amount of time, no questions asked. Or old code that needs a break from you after troubleshooting for too long. A frequent, consistent cadence of meeting in person is best. It feels easeful. And when we can't, there is trust we'll get back to each other when we can. Without pressure or resentment or guilt. It's not meant to be another obligation on the calendar, but a reprieve. We help restore each other through co-presence. We defrag each other's mental hard disks through the process of communing.  

<!-- #### (brave spaces w Sultan?) -->

<!-- Since Zoom Doom, we've been looking for ways to recreate the unique environment we'd built in person using (or building) other a/synchronous tools.  -->

### this literally *makes* the room for each other, creates the room we have together

### we support snacks
Seriously, everyone cites snacks as the number one item that keeps bringing students to our meetups. Snacks are magic. How do snacks do it? I don't know, ask snacks. Make sure you budget for snacks.

Every inquiry into what makes our community thrive was a broken record: 

>"While this is a cliche food has always brought people together. Snacking together in the SCA basement brought out some of the best discussions and ideas I have entertained in college." 
>>—Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science

>"I think the snacks are definitely a big draw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

>"I think I think food was a huge component. It brings people together, it puts people on the same level. Whenever people dine together, it it puts it it levels the playing field, and it kind of brings a sense of equality. That's important."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, Assistant Director, USC Ahmanson Lab

Look for snacks that are computer keyboard friendly, nothing sticky, no tipsy liquids. A mix of salty and sweet is good, a mix of healthful and less-so, and single servings that avoid too much plastic wrapping are ideal: popcorn, pretzels, satsumas, gummy worms. If you have a Trader Joes in your area, we recommend the Sour Scandanavian Swimmers. 

As our meetings transitioned to virtual spaces and across timezones, snacks still held sway as a conversation starter. Then, on return to a campus strictly regulated with no-food policies and mask-wearing, our beloved snacks were off the table (under the table instead). Whether piled in the center of the table, dutifully taken outside, or discussed in their glaring absence, snacks represent the friendly core of the space and a reminder that we are not coding machines but fleshy bodies connected by our need to take breaks to digest and recharge. As we chew and chat, we digest and discuss what we're troubleshooting (both in code and life, it's all part of the processing).  
<!-- As de facto official of the collective, I can report that I never saw any students indulge in snacks during our meetings within view of a campus security camera. -->

### we open sessions with our shared playlist
And it is on point! The Creative Code Collective theme song is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," which came to be when at our first meetup a quiet student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion for our background tunes. I was blown away. And it has been our rallying call ever since. 

A collaborative playlist on your open streaming platform of choice can not only offer some comfortable and energizing background noise while you work, it's another humanizing way to come together around something *other* than code. Anything that levels the field for participants and makes broader connections supports the community at large *and* when working on code. It's all connected! 

### we start each session with show and tell

Or Round Robin, or Check Ins, or Council Method, or some version of an opening gesture for our gathering that acknowledges each person, gives them a short couple of minutes to share anything they want to share today. It could be how they are feeling, what they might be working on, a success or a struggle, something they've read or seen in the wild. By the time we've completed the circle we almost always have a clear trajectory for the rest of the day's meetup and are well into our first conversation or troubleshoot. We have also made room for each person, whether they are shy and would otherwise be steamrolled, or whether they would be first to speak and might otherwise share first each visit.   

>"The terminal is cute. It's important to have a good relationship with your terminal." 
>(Ada)

### we keep things loose

It has been one of my biggest stresses about our Collective learning how to lead. Because leadership feels like a responsibility I take seriously, but also a spotlight or a pedestal I'm wary of, this leadership feels like a tightrope walk in which I try nervously to make sure everyone is comfortable, having fun, and learning—all without forcing anything or having it "look like" anything is happening at all.

Of course, this does not work. That nervous strategy is riddled with stilted efforts of over-structured efforts leading to dead silence and loosey goosey meandering conversations. Along the way I am continually learning the caring practices of facilitation as leadership, as being a vessel and a model. The space is a loose net—some structure is in fact necessary, though I was loathe to be the instigator of that structure at first. 

>>Dazhi: "Can I go on a tangent?" 

>>Sarah: "Always."

## 3. we make mistakes 

### we are serious about silliness

>"Pranking an AI—giving it a task and watching it fail—is a great way to learn about it"[^shane] (Shane 2019, 4).

### we fight for the silly photo
...and I realized this was the entire spirit of the event in one image I glimpsed, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame. I am so grateful to Julia Kloiber from [Superrr Lab](https://superrr.net/about/) for asking to take a picture of the camera's preview screen and posting it on Instagram the day of the event, because that image would have been lost forever if they had not. I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for us to take a silly photo, or a photo in the first place—when the very spirit of the community is itself the entire point. I would not have been so nagged by that missing photo and its contrast to the stiff serious group photo that I spent several days tracking down the original memory card to locate the precious silly photo that so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of the day.

### we voice our "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, deepest fears
Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must do this. We connect over / remember that someone else has already worried the very same thing, or worse. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. I am continually finding that my presence in the classroom/facilitation space as a vulnerable uncertain artistic queer body who nevertheless creates does so much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have lectured. And the less I plan and structure ~~but instead gesture and invite~~, the more space I invite and permit for what needs and wants to arise. 

<div class="play-along" markdown="1">

### PLAY ALONG: hello, old friend

Take a look at an old project, something you made more than six months ago and set aside. Maybe it's an unfinished piece you meant to get back to or an exercise that never got anywhere. That's okay. 

Read through the code with fresh eyes. Look at its syntax and its structure. How has your writing style changed? Is it more succinct? Do you understand how to solve problems differently now? Do you see things you would update or build upon now? 

And what's clever about it? What parts of it have you kept using in other projects? Are there any bits you might like to salvage for new ideas?

In a new file, try rewriting some of the code from scratch to see if you'd compose it differently today. Would you even use the same programming language? 

You could also try this exercise by trading a snippet of old code with a friend. Let them rewrite or continue it, exquisite corpse—style!

</div>

### we put everything in context 

>>"Situated Computation is an approach to computational design that grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and political structures that shape it." 
>(Dr. A. A. Vernelle Noel, Georgia Tech)

### when making we ask Why. And How and Who. Not just What.

### we troubleshoot together
Live coding, though it might seem counterintuitive, sparks confidence. It helps to watch another coder, whether brilliant or beginner or both, struggle under the familiar burden of a problem and that feeling that they cannot solve it, and that they're unfit to call themselves real coders, that they're imposters, and that the feeling will never ever go away. Then collaborating with others to solve it. Remember them next time you feel the same way. You won't always feel that way. 

>"Just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do. But then also, other people will have different perspectives. Also just having that space to work through it together, having the time to sit down and be like, 'Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code.' And then getting to different steps and going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through." 
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

When we are together and witness each other struggle, that commonality reveals the lightness and the joy through community support. You're not going insane because you're not the only one who's gone insane staring at their code before. Yes, you do need sleep. Yes, you'll figure it out, or you'll figure something out. And we're here to help.


>"I loved editing that Three.js[^threejs] scene with Ada. I love being able to have group input. Before I was trying to communicate Three.js knowledge, and I've been struggling to get it out of my head. But, for some reason, seeing it in the group setting, it was a really fulfilling experience--like a teaching moment where I could communicate a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, Assistant Director, USC Ahmanson Lab

[^threejs]: Three.js is a code library (an add-on) in the Javascript language that helps create 3D graphics: [Three.js](https://threejs.org). For similar tools at a more introductory level, also check out the code library [P5.js](https://p5js.org), which is a great place to start learning widely applicable coding skills.
<!-- should i be linking technical tools to the CCC Resource Hub items instead? And can those be linked if they're dynamically generated? -->

### we know teaching others helps us learn

>"There was beginner student who had trouble with code, and I think it was Katherine who helped but I forget. Being able to see the mentorship between between people. That was a really powerful thing for me to see. I remember seeing seeing that kind of like troubleshooting, debugging. That was really important for me to see."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, Assistant Director, USC Ahmanson Lab

### we feature progress / make mistakes in public / work iteratively

For example, I am writing this guide in a git repo using version control, which means the changes are tracked. It is continually updated and saved on a public Github pages website, which means both that you are reading a work in progress and also that anyone can see any prior version of it any time. 

### we are not in class. we're in community.

We strike a balance that is neither the top-down hierarchy of a classroom nor the chaos of a "hierarchy-less" blob. We acknowledge the power dynamics at play and actively address them, working to help folks feel welcoming in community.

Our community is less about how it appears to outsiders than how it feels while inside it, except in the sense of inviting folks in. 

[...]

We fly under the radar. we are a rag-tag troupe of misfits, a dead poets' society, a secret laboratory, a not-so-secret guild.

Our mascots are magpies and meme cats, too-clever animals fascinated with hoarding shiny objects and causing a little trouble. We look to jellyfish and labyrinths for their translucent flexibility, their decentralized nervous systems, their twisty turny mystery and ability to go deep. 

Still we want to find openings for others to enter, [...]

>"I'd love to see this outside of the university setting. I wish this existed for urban professionals. I feel like not all of my Silicon Valley friends would partake in something like this, because they're so burnt out on code. But I'm sure there's a lot of people that are still wanting to have this conversation."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, Assistant Director, USC Ahmanson Lab

## 4. we share resources 

### let's keep track of what we already know, rather than duplicate our work

This started as a Google Doc where anyone could dump a link. It has grown into a fullfledged database, which we iterated on together during group troubleshooting sessions. Then rethought it again as a simple spreadsheet and form to feed the website. It has had many versions. Whether you make a wiki or cover the wall in sticky notes or use the latest sharing platforms all synched up to your phones, finding a free and open way to share information with one another—the lower the barrier the entry the better. There's always a tension between how structured or unstructured to make it (enough so people know where to put things and find things, not so much that they can't imagine new things that don't fit the existing form).

### minimal is accessible

Sometimes the low-fi answer is the right one. When searching for the right tools to build the Creative Code Collective Resource Hub, we went through every possible solution for a database, and landed on a google doc. When looking for ways to build the site for the Intersectional AI Toolkit, again we went through what seemed like endless possibilities for platforms, and landed back at simple JAM stack static sites, github pages, or wiki. Sometimes the less ambitious choices serve different purposes. They offer more access to other audiences. They leave the content and data more open and adaptable and legible to friends who might want to interact with it later, or to us as we build or rebuild it one day. We embrace minimal computing [cite] as an accessible and aesthetic and political value. 

### documentation is hard work, necessary work, just as essential as the code itself


### we choose open source, freely available, easily adaptable tools wherever possible



[...]

## 5. we foreground our values

What are the bricks, the building blocks, the core modules of a community like this one? What are the minimum foundations needed to support the space, to let people grow their craft their own way and flexibly flourish? 

Some items we have considered, or intuitively incorporated:

#### • Knowledge sharing repository/hub

#### • Steady cadence, ritual of gathering

#### • Material care & physical contact/resources

#### • Inclusive, iterative & recursive, inquisitive and embracing approaches


[...]

These principles began as intuition and expanded, distilled, developed along the way as we noted parallels with other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more. 

>>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways" (Brown 2021, 117)

### scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]

>>When the tool doesn't exist we build it. We make it from the other tools we scraped for parts. We break it to learn how it works, to see if it could work a different way, to see if its not working makes it sing out with poetry. We write it out on paper if we don't know how to say it with code. If we can't find an example, if we wonder why it doesn't exist, we know this means we might be the ones who should bring it to life. If it does exist, we also ask if it should. We reverse-engineer it, run it backwards. We learn from others' tutorials, combine them, and modify them, liberally.

I sometimes joke that my projects are a daisy chain of APIs[^api] held together with duct tape and spit. There is magic and politics and new knowledge to be found in creative applications and combinations of existing tools. To think about how to combine ingredients to produce new flavors, connect dots, (mix metaphors).  [...] 

The downside of this is of course when one link in the chain breaks, when a company gets bought by a bigger one and shuts down its open source access, or...

[^api]: APIs are the access points for the code you write to reach different services and tools online. API stands for Application Program Interface, and just as a web interface helps a human reach a website by giving it structure, an API tells your code what constraints it needs to reach that site programmatically. Like a menu, it tells the computer what and how to order up the information it needs. When coders use APIs, they're plugging into additional tools or pulling in data from the outside, for example Instagram or Mailchimp or the National Weather Service, on top of the code they have written themselves.

### growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]

### collaboration, not competition[^ccc]

### we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 

### meet people where they are. don't assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]

>"have things as major steps then under each major step is all the sub steps and any gotcha’s or possible errors" 
>>annatito, Critical Code Studies Working Group 2022
>>"highlight mistakes just as much as successes rather than hide them it is important for people who are new to programming to see people making mistakes, if they think everything works first time they will think they are not good enough and give up." 
>>annatito, Critical Code Studies Working Group 2022

### value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]

we're not task oriented but always in process, always works in progress. when beginning the collective, I described it as focused on project-based learning. But I meant that it was self-directed toward what the student wanted to build, make, create, as opposed to absorbing a pre-determined curriculum of concepts. However, it is not project-based in the sense that it is not focused on outcomes or the completion of projects or tasks. It is more interested in what you learn along the way, how did you use the tools you encountered and how did your choices shape your thinking and how did your thinking shape your choices and tools, reciprocally and iteratively. 

### more than one outcome is possible

 **so many different outcomes for what you decide to do with a technical challenge you want to give to yourself. By spending time with others from different walks of life, we see how others approach the same problem vastly differently. Even with the exact same idea, one person might explore that with the goal to sell it commercially while another explores it by creating an expressive artwork. Along the way they are tackling the same troubleshooting problems, line by line, but perhaps answering the questions that arise very differently based on their goals. It helps to expand the spectrum of what one could make or invent, as a way to get out of our default modes and expectations for ourselves.**

### all theory and practice is theory–practice.[^ccc] interdisciplinary goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality[^ccc]

### #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #indigenouslivesmatter we engage tension; don't indulge drama[^amb] 

### focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]

### listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council]

### assume best intent and attend to impact[^amb]

### attempt collaboration before conflict[^superrr]

### we accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong[^p5] 

### we take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality)[^amb]

### we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

We are excited to know each other and to care for one another as people, not as a means to an end. We learn from each other and our skills improve because of each other, but time and again we realize that is not the only—or even the main—reason we come together. 

These guidelines are open to inputs and updates as necessary to support the needs of this space and community as they evolve.
