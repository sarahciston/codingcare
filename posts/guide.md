## 0. Welcome 

[//]: # "hello world"

### Rough starts & disconnects

Have you considered learning to code but felt too intimidated to try? Have you struggled to program? Or don't know how to apply what you've learned to things you care about? 

[//]: # "or to understand how you'd actually use it?"

Maybe you're decent with programming skills but you'd still never consider yourself a 'coder'. *Coding Care* is about bridging this disconnect——the wide gulf between trying to learn coding and feeling empowered to create with code. 

[//]: # "(even though we likely interact with computation every day)."

>"the prospect of a language that is both hidden and alien to me haunts my work on the net. Like most prejudices, it is born out of fear. I am afraid of what lies buried within the under text"
>>Jessica Loseby, "Code Scares Me"

So many people feel left out of coding communities and spaces for learning about computation. But I believe it is essential for people who come from all different perspectives to share access to the digital languages which are altering the world and what it becomes. *I* want to live in a world that is shaped by *your* point of view and many others' point of views — not a world shaped only by one narrow take on what computers can be and do. 

>"I was that convinced that I didn’t have the ability or technological talent to learn how to write code for something. I assumed that every person around me was miles ahead in their practice, and wondered how my passion for creative storytelling could really play into something so new and untouched." 
>>Tia Kemp, she/her, BA USC Media Arts + Practice

### Don't stop me now

My own first experiences learning to code felt *awful*. Lonely. Discouraging. Confusing. I had the sense I was "supposed" to learn programming skills. It felt important, like I needed these tools in order to create the kind of art and language and world I imagined — but it also felt like an insurmountable chore. I had the sense everyone else could hack it but me: *Why was I the only one who didn't understand (or care!) about these dry, boring examples? Why was I getting lost in all the confusing, specialized vocabularies?* I felt thrown into a strange landscape——I lacked even the words to ask for what I needed, a basic knowledge of where to look, or an instinct for how to start. 

I wish I had known then that learning to code didn't have to feel like getting stuck. It didn't have to feel like I was fitting myself into someone else's stencil shape of a stereotypical engineer. I wish I had known that learning to code could feel like this:

![Freddie Mercury](../assets/img/freddie.gif)

Coding has helped me feel powerful and imaginative, sometimes even unstoppable. I learned (eventually, through trial and error)(and error and error) that coding can be fun — even playful, relaxed, welcoming. It can be creative, thoughtful, crafty. 

Once I accepted that the false starts and frustrations of learning to code are part of the process for *everyone*, that these don't make us 'not real coders', I began to push through these struggles more easily. Whenever I persist with coding, I find it rewards my effort with community connections, creative revelations, and more puzzling challenges. 

I have learned I can make coding my own, and that anyone else can too. This guide talks about how to nurture the supportive spaces that make this sparkly code feeling possible.

#### (En)coding rituals: What are the practices of coding communities? 

Code is language and code is a tool for expressing and enacting combined. But coding has "belonged" to far too few for far too long, while the rest of us are considered outsiders to the encoded systems that consume us.

Current rituals and protocols around programming are stale: The stereotype of the hacker in a cave, clacking away at high speed as glyphs flash on a dark screen. The gray-hoodied employees playing ping pong in the office park, building rational white robots and ever-helpful femmebots. The black box that obscures machine learning's inner workings with hype, mysticism, and elitism.

This guidebook wants to enrich the rituals of programming to include the joy, community, and care necessary to make different kinds of code — and different kinds of worlds. It explores the practices of and in communities which are feeding new kinds of code and new kinds of coders that can [change the world]. [xxx]

### Code isn't magic, but we are

>"No way, code is magic." 
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

I believe in our power to reshape the world around us by experimenting wildly with the kinds of code, tools, aesthetics, and ethics we want to see. Although making a piece of code finally work certainly feels like magic, I keep learning that this magic comes from *us*. It does not from automated or autonomous systems, from the next hyped tech, or [xxxxx], which have always been deeply intertwined with humans in every way. 

* How do we bring our magic to the systems we want to affect? 
* How do we change systems to suit us if we are stuck outside them – without conforming to their encoded ways of thinking? 
* How can we build communities that facilitate alternatives? 

These are the open questions explored by this guide — and explored every time we practice code-making in community.

### Code as collective: An open question

### aka What's in this pocket guide? What's a code collective and how do I get one?

Creative Code Collective is the community I started in early 2019 for media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I sent out a call, because I was looking for others who were struggling with code same as I was, and I hoped there might be another way — at the very least, we could struggle together. 😬 We launched with the mottos: **"Scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code"** and **"We all have skills to teach each other."**

Throughout the guide I'll share what I've learned while building Code Collective — about coding, connecting, and building collectives. The guide honors and draws from the many mentors and teachers who have inspired it, gathering many resources found along the way. Of course the guide includes many reflections and contributions from community members — including coding examples and exercises, favorite projects and personal accounts — because this work is never done in isolation. I'll discuss connections I've found between coding and other crafts like zine publishing and fiber arts. I'll also discuss connections to open-source, open-access, and activist movements that shape the approach to how we gather and what we create. The guide is a melange of materials and methods, hopefully a spark of inspiration and the start of many conversations around these ideas. 

I am writing both as a representative of this community and also as an individual greatly influenced by it and by so many other creators, thinkers, and teachers. I want to document our work processes and thought processes, and to honor the many entangling threads that go into shaping a caring (coding) community. 

The heart of this book are [ten] principles that have emerged through gathering as Code Collective. They are simple tactics for anyone to employ in their own community practices — or adapt to suit them. Developing these tactics has been intuitive, iterative, and collaborative. They emerged out of desire and instinct. We have expanded and distilled these tactics influenced by other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more; and we have reshaped them continually as our group evolves. All recommendations in the book are intended to be descriptive, not prescriptive. Here's what has worked for us (and what hasn't). I invite you to embrace and adapt what works for you and leave the rest. And I am interested in how these tactics change in different circumstances, so if you find something that works better for you, I'd be excited to learn about it too! 

Each of the guiding principles is paired with sections called `PLAY ALONG` – practical exercises you can try — and `LIVE CODE` — brief case studies from other communities of practice. Although Coding Care is a pocket guide, it also lives in large part online as a [`PROJECT SHOWCASE`](https://creativecodecollective.com/showcase) of active works by Code Collective Community members and as a vibrant [`RESOURCE HUB`](https://creativecodecollective.com/resource-hub), a database of tutorials, textbooks, projects, code libraries, zines, and all manner of things we have found useful.

>>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways" (adrienne maree brown 2021, 117)

Many of the things we do to sustain supportive communities seem too obvious to mention——or even worse, too obvious to notice — such that they aren't obvious *at all*. This guide is meant to remind me that these approaches matter, and to acknowledge how much they have supported me and others along the way. This guide celebrates those ephemeral things that make our caring coding community go. *It tries to describe our intuitive wayfinding about how to learn and teach and explore and be together, especially in and through the very things that both draw us in and also scare us, the things that feel both challenging and fun, frustrating and rewarding.*

It is not one gesture or one moment, but their accumulation. Each thing we have done intentionally, and unintentionally, adds up to *us*. To collect, to gather, to hoard like magpies. To embrace fascination with the shiny objects even when we don't yet know their purpose. To trust their meaning in our gut. To trust connections with other people. To rely on each other, to reconnect again and again, over the smallest things. To be vulnerable in shared struggle, shared silliness, shared delight. 

### Man(ifest)ual (manualifesto) & what this pocket guide isn't

This guide is not a manifesto, as much as I love a manifesto. Johanna Hedva says, "a manifesto is only ever a document that reaches too far, that speculates too impossibly, and that the only use a manifesto can have is to lay bare why it cannot be manifested, to open itself to all the ways its un-manifestation shapes the world" [^hedva2022]@hedvaWhyItTaking – yet here I document what we've actually put in the world, alongside what we hope to. Code Collective exists because I believe it is incredibly easy to have communities like this, and I am not the only one. Like code itself, and Code Collective, this guide strives to bring the "impossible" into the "real world" now – as a proposition toward how it can be entirely possible, present, liveable, and thriving. Anarchists call this "prefiguration" but we can just call it fun. And so the pocket guide exists somewhere between a manifesto and a manual. Make of it what you will; I hope you do!

## 1. We create who we are together

>"What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

Code Collective is a self-organizing community of artists, makers, students, people from all backgrounds——especially including those who have not done much or any coding before. We meet regularly to develop our programming practices in a flexible, co-working, co-learning setting.

We are artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders, computer science majors, writers, dancers, linguists, neuroscientists, trans kids, queer folks, refugees, parents, staff and teachers, independent learners. We come from all career stages and from all levels of expertise. We come from many cultures, sexualities, classes, and genders. Many of us do not come to programming from a STEM-education pipeline (but some do). Our interests exceed the bounds of what our specializations offer and what our vocabularies describe. We all find different ways into code and community.

I started organizing the collective as an intervention. I craved a space where I felt welcome and free to explore without constraint, after experiencing how programming cultures had intimidated me and after witnessing how they had discouraged so many others. I noticed the need for supportive spaces that could value diverse capacities to learn. After my own struggles learning to code, and after a few joyful experiences that showed me it could be otherwise, I wanted to make space for anyone else struggling to find their fit, anyone convinced there was no place for them in the existing systems. 

Code Collective was necessary for me because I kept having the experience elsewhere that no one could understand what I was trying to make or do. I felt like I was not making sense – and certainly I was not sure myself – but some glimmer or gut feeling kept pulling me toward tinkering even though I was hitting walls, getting frustrated, hearing that it shouldn't or couldn't be done. Now I remind new visitors to Code Collective: *If you have an inkling (or a fear) that coding might be for you, it probably is. Welcome.* [^queerfeeling]

### Start anywhere 

Upon gathering, I ask myself: What does this particular cluster of beings need and want from this gathering? What do we stand for? We get to define it and redefine it for ourselves. At our first meeting in January 2019, attendees cited a mix of desires for joining what would become Code Collective:

* "to learn what [programming] language is used for what"
* "not to be intimidated to try something new"
* "see what others do, have a set time to work on projects and keep skills sharp"
* "not to check the assigned boxes but find an artistic approach. make stuff"
* "ask questions"
* "see others projects and help"
* "see weird projects and find interesting solutions"
* "have an accountability space and a brain trust with shared expertise"
* "conquer my trouble starting and finishing. bounce ideas off of others. build something I'm proud of"

>"For me, I could figure out how to code but I didn't really know what to use for what, and for the specific things I like. Also part of the issues here is there's so many things you could do, right?"
>Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science

To explore how we might best create community, I asked each person to share what they were currently working on, some topics they knew about, some topics they wanted to know about. The goal here is to look for overlaps: Where do what you know about and what I want to know about intersect? Here lies magic!

As time goes on, our needs change, and our formats and structures keep pace. We have moved from conversations about possible group projects, mission statements, and organizational concerns toward a more freeform agenda, toward a blend of form and freedom that holds space for anyone's individual projects and needs during that meeting time.

### Be works-in-progress 

When beginning the collective, I described its focus as project-based learning, but later refined this to mean more process-oriented than task-oriented work. 

The group remains self-directed toward what its members want to make, and the process they take to make it, instead of requiring they absorb a pre-determined curriculum or complete particular objectives. Our conversations focus more on what you are learning along the way, how you are using the tools you found, how your technical choices are shaping your critical thinking, and how did your critical thinking is shaping your technical choices and tools, reciprocally and iteratively. 

When we "value process as much as, or more than, outcomes"[^amb], when we maintain a "beginner's mind" approach no matter what stage of that process, we can stay dynamic and we can acknowledge imperfection and ongoingness. I find this helps relinquish perceived requirements and impossible goals. 

This guide is also a work in progress. The guide shows its rough edges before it is ready. It has been drafted from scratch on a public website, built using Github, which displays its code repository and version tracking. This means that every past version of the text is available to view. Readers can compare differences in the history ([for example](https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commit/5e1ef814d661f43027e3d0f15b5ba87415194cfe?diff=unified)) line by line and comment on the text as it changes. This laid-bare writing process enacts the Code Collective value **growth, not perfection**, which is mostly a reminder for myself. Working this way is a practice of vulnerability and an invitation for conversation. 

### Build it together & expand definitions

There are so many different outcomes and approaches possible for any technical challenge. By spending time with others, especially with different perspectives, we get to see how they might approach the same problem vastly differently. Even with the exact same concept, one person might implement it through a commercial product while another might implement it as an expressive artwork.

Working among others helps us continually question and expand our definitions. Along the way, you could each tackle similar troubleshooting issues in lines of code, but perhaps you would answer the questions that arise very differently based on your own goals. It helps to expand the spectrum of what one could make or invent, as a way to get out of our default modes and expectations for ourselves.

Designing the online presence for Code Collective has been an ongoing collaboration. Through the (perhaps menial but important) work of creating a seemingly simple site, we had to confront and create our collective identity very practically. We get to decide the tone of who we are as a group, how we will present ourselves, and to which publics: How do we describe what we are doing, what we prioritize, what we call ourselves, how we explain our processes, how we support others who join? What format do we put this in? What language do we use? Who do we make sure is included in this process?

Through this process of communication and collaboration among the group members about who we are and what we want to offer, the Code Collective website has expanded from a static landing page into a unique resource hub and project showcase – with a searchable, contributable database of tools, tutorials, research, and projects we have found useful.

## 2. We get scrappy

Code Collective endorses **scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code**. We love your spaghetti code, your half-finished thought, your sketchy mindmap — just as much as we love the polished work it may one day be. When someone joins up wanting to try something new, we don't say, "That's not what code is for." Instead we're excited to discover yet another thing code can be for and how we can help them figure it out. 

We echo the call from the P5.js community statement, which warns against "code snobs" and assuming or prioritizing types of knowledge.[^p5] There is no programming language empirically better than any other; there's only the right tool for a particular task, for a particular person, at a particular point in time. It's totally fine to rely on code libraries and examples and the wisdom of those who came before you. Who doesn't!? We will always be reliant on collected and collective knowledge. 

Don't wait until you know you'll do it "perfectly" (or read the whole book, or taken the whole course) before you get started. Half the fun is in adapting unexpected outcomes into your process. Making and learning are reciprocal activities, a mobius strip of embodied knowledge. 

### Don't be afraid to break stuff (you can't *really* break it)

How do you start getting scrappy instead of studious? Break things! Or at least, don't be afraid to. The [TinkerTank](https://tinkertank.de/) mobile makerspace in Germany starts each of their workshops by selecting a piece of old electronics from their scrap pile — and completely dismantling it. "People are afraid to break things," workshop leader Johannes May told me, and this helps warm people up to build new, imaginative things from the broken parts. 

Too often I don't get started because I don't know where to start, and also because I am afraid to "mess up" what already exists. That's what backups and save-as and sketches are for. You can't (irrevocably) break anything, in all likelihood. And in the process of tinkering (which is just breaking with flair) you learn a lot![^tinker] So try to push through the fear of breaking something, or doing something "wrong," to make space for doing something "weird" aka interesting. So, knowing that you can't really break it, get cracking!

[^tinker]: To tinker is also to mend, to patch up, repair, or improve in a makeshift way [OED]. The word derives in part from the tasks of metalworkers (per Miller Puckette & OED). 

I learned to use scrappy artistic strategies from my first computational arts teacher, [Brett Stalbaum](https://visarts.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/brett-stalbaum.html). I was a poet who wanted to make weird books, and he told me simply, "Pick something small you want to try to make, and use that to begin learning Python." Reader—I was *terrified*. I had been making tiny GIF poems and had tried and failed repeatedly to teach myself some HTML, CSS, and Javascript. But none of it would stick. Still, I trusted Brett, so I found a little example code for a simple chatbot and used it to make what would become "ladymouth" — a bot that tries to explain feminism to misogynists online. Along the way, I learned enough about Python and SQLite and Raspberry Pi and toxic Reddit forums to make it run, even though I started with zero vocabulary and knowledge about relational databases or APIs or anything else. Through Brett's positive encouragement, and by finding the right tools for the job (Python was the language that made sense to me when other languages didn't), I slowly overcame my belief that I wasn't a coder, that I couldn't understand the tools I wanted to use, and that I didn't belong in the spaces that interested me (or that I didn't even know about). Being among others who were experimenting in these same ways taught me it was okay not to have all the pieces in place right away. [xxxmaybemove]

### Critical breaking

If something exists, ask how it does. Ask if it should. Reverse engineer it. Run it backward. Learn from others' tutorials. Combine them. Modify them liberally. Pull from everywhere and remix wildly. Cite generously.

This is part of what we mean by scrappy — thoughtfully or playfully experimenting with the properties and limits of your materials, whether those materials are strings of wool or strings of code. This kind of "breaking" things is an essential artistic practice, and it looks different in every situation. It can range from off-the-cuff experimentation – "What happens if I push this?" — to full-fledged tactical media artworks that operate by digital civil disobedience – like the collective Electronic Disturbance Theater, which created tools to shut down government websites by pinging them repeatedly (called "distributed denial of service").[cite] For my past projects, this has ranged from diving into technology spaces I dislike (Reddit forums), tinkering with combining wildly different APIs[^api], and putting poetry into machine learning systems meant for corporate use. 

Critically breaking things helps us understand how they work (or don't work) from inside. It lets us understand some of the why behind their operations, the decisions that went into making them. Who are they made for? And with what goals? Who are they not made for and who do they not serve? It helps us think about how we might make them differently. I break stuff to see if its not-working can create some poetry, some community, some other way to engage with value than its original (likely capitalist) purpose. [^htmlEnergy][XXX]

Maybe all this tinkering doesn't feel "important" or "relevant" enough? Don't worry about that yet. Tinkering is a transferrable, lifelong skill:

>"If you can teach students how to break one part critically, then they can go off and break other parts on their own in their career.

<div class="play-along box" markdown="1">

### PLAY ALONG: Break this code

One of the best ways to get started with learning a new aspect of programming is to take someone else's example code and learn how it's working by changing things — just little things to start. What happens if I make this a different color or run it at a different speed? How does it show up on screen? Then break big things — use it for different purposes, combine it with other code. 

Find some example code for a website you like by right clicking on any part of it in your web browser and hitting `Inspect`. You should see some windows appear that show the HTML and CSS source code for the site, where you can temporarily and without fear modify the site as you wish. Give yourself a fun mini challenge.

For example: What if the New York Times had a purple background? 

* Try going to to the `Styles` (Chrome) or `Rules` (Firefox) window that opened when you hit inspect.
* Find `background` or `background-color:` and change what follows it to say `purple`

What other experiments with CSS might you try? What can you learn using this method about how the site you chose was built? 

This is a very aesthetic and web-based example, but you can imagine taking this approach to any tutorial or example you see. 

Retype it, learn how it works, break it for fun or for your own purposes.

</div>

### Build stuff

Breaking stuff beautifully leads to building new stuff. 

Build something to prove to yourself that it can exist or it should. 

Build it as an offering for others. 

Build something to show that building is for anyone. These objects are instruction manuals for hope. 

When the tool you need for building doesn't exist, build that too. Make it from existing tools you scrapped for parts. 

When you don't know the programming language you need for what you're building, trust you can pick up just enough of it to get by along the way. Write it out on paper if you don't know how to build it with code. Show it to a friend who can point you in a new direction. 

Find an example that looks enough like what you imagine to extrapolate. When you can't find a tutorial, don't assume it can't be done. Don't assume it isn't meant to be done. This means you might be the one to do it. 

Try asking with new language, asking a friend with a different background, asking with hands in the dirt, asking while tinkering on another project in another medium, asking while doodling or napping. Take breaks, but keep asking until answers circle back. Write it out on paper, draw it, sing it, dance it out. 

*Persistence is a rhythm not a slog.*

### LIVE CODE: Go slow, be of service

I have learned from many communities building transfeminist infrastructures that slow and embodied and connected "art that surfaces the hitherto invisible labor of service, care, and maintenance" has a place in coding communities as both a practical tool and a critique of institutions.[^Kleesattel] By modeling slower, more communal practices around these essential services, community and transfeminist server networks and collectives like Constant, Lurk, Rosa, [Systerserver](https://systerserver.net/), [varia](https://vvvvvvaria.org/en/pages/about.html)[XXXmakelinks], and others [XXX add Argentine servers] show how the maintenance of tools and materials (whether for internet services or any mutual aid) are essential forms of labor that can express power differently [XXXexplain/unpack?]. They can be careful and caring, or they can be consolidating and constrictive. They ask us to think about the precarious bodies (individual and connected) that rely on them. "A Wishlist for Trans\*feminist Servers" (continuously updated and retitled since 2014), lays out some of the objectives of this kind of caring codework. Trans\*feminist Servers...

>"... radically question the conditions for serving and service; they experiment with changing client-server, user-device and guest-host-ghost relations where they can. Who is serving whom? Who is serving what? What is serving whom? Are they being served?"

>"... do not serve every body; they continuously re-negotiate what counts as accessible. They respond to the fluctuating abilities, embodied knowledges and genealogies of their care-takers and users."

>"... reject generalized definitions of efficiency, efficacy, ease-of-use, transparency, scalability, accessibility, inclusion, optimization and immediacy because they are often traps."

### Get sticky, listen to materials

I joke that my projects are held together with duct tape and spitballs, but it's basically true. Most of them use a wild-sourced daisy chain of APIs[^api] and random tools from different domains, because this is what it requires to sketch out an idea I haven't seen represented elsewhere. There is magic and politics and new knowledge to be found in creative (read: unintended, inappropriate) applications and combinations of existing tools. 

[^api]: APIs are the access points for the code you write to reach different services and tools online. API stands for Application Program Interface. In the same way a web interface (browser protocol) helps a human reach a website by giving it structure, an API tells your code what constraints it needs to reach that site using programming. Like ordering from a menu, an API tells the programmer what they can order and how to request the information they need. When coders use APIs, they're pulling data or tools into their program from the outside — for example the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) — on top of the code they have written themselves. The downside of relying on external APIs is of course when one link in the chain breaks, when a company gets bought by a bigger one and shuts down its open source access, or updates their system... your code also breaks. (Hence the duct tape.)$$

To think about how to combine ingredients to produce new flavors, connect dots, (mix metaphors) is an explicitly artistic approach, because it is a way of thinking with (and against) materials *as such*. It questions and engages the material properties of the platforms, codes, cultures, data, and infrastructures, in the same ways artists explore other materials — whether paint color, wood grain, fiber textures, or anything else. Listening to your materials can make work self-reflexive in incredibly useful and critical ways, whether you decide to work with or against their attributes. 

One way to combine wildly is to work wildly with metaphors, as Ren Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard do when they unpack the acronym CS to expand the field of "computer science" to include "Chance and Scandal," "Crying Sabotage," "Careful Slugs," and more. They suggest this "promiscuous metaphorical practice" can open up different plans, questions, and techniques in the field – including considerations of crip-technoscience and of more-than-human world:  

>"We follow CS (Careful Slugs) in how it might reroute, chomp away, do nothing about, slime up, slow down, or ripple towards attachments as a way of accounting for, unsettling, taking responsibility for, and remaking dominant universalisms of CS (Computer Science). We propose that when computation is approached through the speculation of CS (Careful Slugs), the computational operations of sorting become slowed down, separating becomes impossible as sticky bodies stick to surfaces, categorizing becomes softened."
>>–Ren Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard (2022) @brittonCarefulSlugsCaring2022a

It matters what materials you use and what metaphors you think with, whether your projects are held together with spitballs or slug trails.

### Learn how to learn

The goal is "growth not perfection." You will never get to "the end" where you have learned the entirety of a programming language. There will always be more to learn. Rather, the goal is to learn how to learn - to learn how to find the language to describe the questions you want to ask. With this skill alone, you already have all the tools you need to find the tools you need, all the skills you need to learn the skills you need — to make or do anything at all, eventually. 

How do we learn how to learn? We tinker and stretch a bit — whether in breadth or depth or both. We work from the foundations of what we already know and use it as metaphors to help us understand what we don't yet know. We question the foundations of what we already know and use new information to reflect on it in new contexts. We collage and combine and experiment with what might go together unexpectedly, what we might have taken for granted right in front of us. How did you learn the things you most enjoy? Was it from a text book or from your own explorations? What kinds of exploratory approaches work best for you?

## 3. We get vulnerable

### Plan to unplan, plan to be awkward

Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must get vulnerable about our craft. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. We can connect with each other around areas of concern, taking comfort that someone else has already worried the very same thing. Rather than showing a veneer of know-it-all authority (which is often quite thin), sets up both a one-directional hierarchy of exchange and an impossible standard for students other community members to meet. It shows them a person who "already knows" but it doesn't show them how to get there. 

I am continually finding that my presence in learning spaces as a vulnerable, uncertain, artistic queer body — who nevertheless creates — does much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have said in a lecture. All the other suggestions that follow were possible because I modeled them first. I said, "I don't know either, let's figure it out together." 

The socially awkward planner in me wants to know in advance what's going to happen in every session. But the less I plan and structure, and instead gesture and invite, the more space exists for group needs and wants as they arise. Some of my favorite teachers have whole slide decks I've seen them chuck out the moment the class discussion went another direction. I never understood that before, because I wanted to suck all that knowledge out of my teachers' heads. Now that I'm teaching, I get it. I'm more interested in what my students want to know than what I have to say. And when they share what they want to know, I can trust I'll have something to offer that can enrich, support, or connect with that instead. 

Your milage may vary, as mine has! I want to acknowledge that some folks are given much more leeway to display uncertainty while retaining their authority and respect than others are. I understand that your vulnerability will have boundaries and capacity limits, as mine does.[^identity1] 

[^identity1]: e.g. It looks very different for a white male professor with job security to engage "casually" or "flexibly" and still receive the benefit of the doubt when up for review. I want to use the privilege I have as a white person who has learned to "speak academic" (in the contexts where I must) to turn that voice off where I can and dismantle those structures as much as I can. I still worry about how I am perceived as "too feely" or "too feminine" or "too casual" in my non-binary queer femme graduate student instability. But however possible, I want to make it more comfortable for folks like me — and folks unlike me who may be even more precarious in academic or technologist spaces — to have a home here too. That doesn't happen without those of us who have the capacity to shut off the gatekeeping rhetoric doing so.

### Ask "stupid" questions (psst.. there are no stupid questions)

Try voicing your "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, and fears.

Without fail, when someone bravely asks what they call a "stupid" question, it is a question others have too. Or it's a question they've been taking for granted and haven't considered before. Usually it requires even those who think they already know the answer to think more deeply about the question in order to answer it in plain language. 

So-called stupid questions help us all unpack what we consider assumed knowledge. Frequently, assumed knowledge points to the foundations of a field of study and how its histories are told through lenses of white supremacy, misogyny, colonialism, and ableism. We should all be asking these questions to understand our work and our contexts through new lenses. In this way, the "beginner" in the room makes one of the largest contributions to everyone's co-learning experience. 

### Troubleshoot together

>"Just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do. But then also, other people will have different perspectives. Also just having that space to work through it together, having the time to sit down and be like, 'Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code.' And then getting to different steps and going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through." 
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

Sharing our struggles helps us solve them. In Code Collective, we do a lot of team troubleshooting, in which several folks gather around a screen to explore a project. Several things happen when we join together this way, and none require the participants to have expertise on the specific issue at hand. 

- First, simply explaining the problem to another person (or inanimate object, called "rubber ducking" in programming communities) can have the effect of helping you think it through in a new way for yourself. 
- Second, your partners might see something you don't see: Even if they have never used this language before or worked in this kind of task, they might approach the issue in a different way. 
- Third, if no one else sees how to approach the issue, they might know someone who does or have heard about a tool that could help.

### Make mistakes in public / ~~Accept~~ Highlight your mistakes

>"highlight mistakes just as much as successes, rather than hide them. it is important for people who are new to programming to see people making mistakes, if they think everything works first time they will think they are not good enough and give up." 
>>annatito, Critical Code Studies Working Group 2022@titoWeekP5Js2022

**Highlighting** mistakes is not about focusing on the negative; it brings our problems out of the shadows and removes the shame. Our mistakes connect us with each other. They show us we're not the first to encounter this issue,[^first] and they also show us we're not alone with the experience of facing coding challenges. Being vulnerable makes us stronger and brings us closer. 

[^first]: Occasionally, we *are* the first to encounter this issue because we're trying to do something entirely new and important. It is helpful to get encouragement from friends either way. 

Live coding, though it might seem counterintuitive, sparks confidence. It helps to watch another coder, whether brilliant or beginner or both, struggle under the familiar burden of a problem — that feeling that they cannot solve it, that they're unfit to call themselves real coders, that they're imposters, and that the feeling will never ever go away. Then watching them collaborate with others to solve it. Remember that person the next time you feel the same way. You won't always feel that way. 

When we are together and witness each other struggle, that commonality reveals lightness and joy through community support. (You're not going insane, because you're not the *only one* who's gone insane staring at their code before. Yes, you do need sleep. Yes, you'll figure it out, or you'll figure something out. And we're here to help.) 

>"I loved editing that Three.js[^threejs] scene with Ada. I love being able to have group input. Before I was trying to communicate Three.js knowledge, and I've been struggling to get it out of my head. But, for some reason, seeing it in the group setting, it was a really fulfilling experience — like a teaching moment where I could communicate a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

[^threejs]: Three.js is a code library (an add-on) in the Javascript language that helps create 3D graphics: [Three.js](https://threejs.org). For similar tools at a more introductory level, also check out the code library [P5.js](https://p5js.org), which is a great place to start learning widely applicable coding skills.

### Work iteratively, feature progress

When we don't share our struggles with learning, it's incredibly easy to feel alone. It's easy to compare our efforts to other people's polished, finished products — of course, in that case, we find our half-complete creations wanting. This is true for all kinds of learning, including just learning to be in the world. There is no final state; there is continuous learning. 

For example, I am writing this pocket guide in a git repo (a type of archive used in programming to keep track of versions and allow multiple users to make edits). I continually update it and save it on a public Github Pages website, which means both that you are reading a work in progress and also that anyone can see any prior version of it any time ([here](https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commits/Jekyll/posts/guide.md)). I started this practice in 2020 when I wanted to show the process and performance of academic work that was ongoing labor rather than the invisible production of perfect, authoritative, publishable static documents. I see this approach in publications like zines, which aren't afraid to show their rough, handmade edges. And I am inspired by books like Winne Soon and Geoff Cox's 2021 book [Aesthetic Programming](https://aesthetic-programming.net/), which was also written using git and exists in open, hybrid, print and digital forms. Soon and Cox posed the git format as an invitation to others to "fork the book" and adapt it to their own needs, in order to expand the book's community of practice.

We need more spaces that embrace and reflect the many different kinds of learning and ongoing forms of creation.

### PLAY ALONG: Hello, old friend

Take a look at an old project, something you made more than six months ago and set aside. Maybe it's an unfinished piece you meant to get back to or an exercise that never got anywhere. That's okay. 

Read through the code with fresh eyes. Look at its syntax and its structure. How has your writing style changed? Is it more succinct? Do you understand how to solve problems differently now? Do you see things you would update or build upon now? 

And what's clever about it? What parts of it have you kept using in other projects? Are there any bits you might like to salvage for new ideas?

In a new file, try rewriting some of the code from scratch to see if you'd compose it differently today. Would you even use the same programming language? 

You could also try this exercise by trading a snippet of old code with a friend. Let them rewrite or continue it, exquisite corpse—style!

## 4. We make it weird

### Move toward the weird

Don't be afraid to get weird together. 

>"Pranking an AI—giving it a task and watching it fail—is a great way to learn about it"[^shane] (Shane 2019, 4).

My own personal artistic mantra is to "move toward the weird." In my practice, how I follow my interests and push my research forward is find the most strange, uncanny, uncomfortable aspects of whatever I'm working on. If something makes me cringe, that's a place to explore (within limits of course). Rather than research questions I can test and answer with hypotheses, I'm interested in the *research tensions* I know I won't solve but keep bugging me in a visceral way. In my case, it has included the discomfiting way technologies insinuate themselves into our intimate experiences, through things like personal data tracking, or the way machine learning systems carry with them the residues of their training data language into their outputs. It has included filming myself and tracking myself, because I am super uncomfortable both of those and they feel weird but interesting. What would be your strange but fascinating thing? How do you like to get weird?

### Fight for the silly photo

Anywhere you can take silliness seriously is a space to expand. You might think I'm joking, but I learned this through experience. 

A few years ago I ran my first a workshop where we made zines and talked about AI. It was incredibly fun, and at the end we took a group photo to remember it by. First we took a normal photo and then a silly one. The professional photographer showed us the thumbnails in their camera, and Julia Kloiber from [Superrr Lab](https://superrr.net/about/) took a picture of the silly photo inside camera's preview screen. We had a good laugh about this meta moment. Later Julia posted the picture-in-picture online, and I'm so grateful, because without it that image would have been lost forever. 

When I got all the day's photos back from the photographer, there was our single group photo. We looked fine — but bored as hell. Nowhere was our silly photo, the one that captured the entire joyful spirit of the event. They had edited our photos out and didn't think the silly photo was important. 

Without that glimpse, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame, I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for a silly photo in the first place (or a photo at all). But the very community itself is the entire point. 

Without Julia's silly picture-in-picture of a silly picture, I would not have been so bothered by that missing photo and its contrast to our stiff, serious, professional group photo, that I spent several days sending embarrassing emails, tracking down the photographer and the original memory card, to locate the precious silly photo — because that precious silly photo so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of the day.

Don't be shy, fight for your silly photos and the moments that don't seem like they should matter. They do!

### Adopt mascots 

We've adopted the magpie as our official mascot: an intelligent, crafty corvid fascinated with shiny objects and capable of using tools. 

Our other, unofficial mascots are the queer misfit pirates from the TV show *Our Flag Means Death*. They support and champion each other, do projects together, explore identity, figure out their career goals, and fumble new skills while going on adventures. 

These both embody the vibe of our group and remind us to enjoy that vibe too. 

What would you adopt as your mascot or icon? What's the first person, place, thing, or idea that comes to mind? 

What vocabulary do you use to describe its structure: Is it a secret society? A collaboratory? An elicit escape? Find ways to make your organization feel more fun than yet another meeting on your calendar.

## 5. We all have skills to teach each other

>"There must be an ongoing recognition that [...] everyone contributes. These contributions are resources." –bell hooks

### Remember what you already know

Tell us something you know about! Tell us something you'd like to learn!

Each of us already knows A LOT. Trust that you have a lot to contribute, even if you are arriving as a "n00b" (newbie) who has never touched code before (see [Ask 'stupid' questions](#ask-stupid-questions-psst-there-are-no-stupid-questions)). 

Try not to be intimidated that you're showing up to a space where everyone else will "know more than you." Even if you don't know how to make the thing you've come to learn about, you have experience in plenty of other things. You can apply your life experience and knowledge to support other people with what they want to learn. And you can bring that experience to bear on your project and how you learn it. 

### Swap skills, look for overlaps

Simple gestures like skill swaps begin to level hierarchies and connect people. For example, if you have experience with 3D printing or physical computing, but you want to learn virtual reality programming, you may find someone else who has experience in VR who wants to explore making physical objects. If your background is art or poetry or philosophy or dance, you can provide valuable aesthetic, ethical, and critical feedback to programmers making new artworks. 

### Remember no one knows everything

Everyone has a perspective, and no one knows everything. We may know about the same things, the same programming languages or tools or subjects — and yet understand them completely differently. Everyone brings lots of unique expertise to any given situation. No matter how much we already know, we can still learn a lot by listening to each other's approach. 

### Take comfort in this Programmer's Paradox

#### You may never feel like a "real programmer." You already are a programmer.[^amy]

[^amy]: With thanks to [Amy Rae Fox](https://madebyafox.github.io/)

>"Computer-centric terms such as ‘novice’ obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and are prejudicial in assigning prominence to the computer." 
>>— Bonnie Nardi @nardiSmallMatterProgramming1993

Take heart if you don't feel like you're really a coder. Many of my favorite computer scientists and professional programmers have told me they don't either! There may never be a time when you reach the feeling of proper expertise or authority in your field, but the secret is that this is not the secret to competency. Those people walking around like they know what they're doing? Adulting? Ha! They probably don't know either. 

And the divisions between who knows, who gets to know, who gets to learn and claim knowing are primarily artificially imposed by gatekeeping structures and language. Melanie Hoff points out how we are ["always-already programming"](https://gist.github.com/melaniehoff/95ca90df7ca47761dc3d3d58fead22d4) in so many ways. She argues that "the programmer is also the user is also the programmer" and these roles have been artificially divorced.@AlwaysalreadyprogrammingMd We can reunite the ideas of programmer and user in our work as pro-am (professional-amateur) pro-users (programmer-users) who dabble, tinker, and find joy in the spaces in between. 

>"When we all build up and cultivate one another’s agency to shape technology and online spaces, we are contributing to creating a world that is more supportive, affirming, and healing." "It's buttons all the way down." 
>>–Melanie Hoff

Bonnie Nardi's concept of "end-user programming" helps dismantle the hierarchy of software maker/user and emphasizes the work a user does is another kind of programming. Every day we customize settings and change parameters, we put formulas in spreadsheets and create automatic workflows in photo editors. She argues these "end-users" are not naive but make intensive use of computers. She includes such tasks on a continuum with programming that addresses the machine at various levels, whether "close to the metal" like assembly languages or abstracted high-level languages like object-oriented programming.@nardiSmallMatterProgramming1993 We see this continuum continuing to blur now with "prompt programming," which involves writing plain-text commands for generative AI systems. 

### Remember you know how to learn

Nardi also reminds us we easily learn things like programming all the time, when we feel empowered to do so and are excited about them. Within knitting patterns, like baseball scoresheets, she points out:

>"a great deal of information is contained within a terse set of instructions; the instructions (while appearing incomprehensible to non-knitters) are accessible to any ordinary person who decides to learn to knit; and, just as the filled-out scoresheet records the way a game unfolded, the knitting instructions provide a permanent record of the way the task of knitting an afghan unfolds [...]"

Both these formal languages involve "the use of constructs familiar to programmers: modules of instructions, subroutines, global variables, means for specifying conditions, and iteration." Nardi says when people have an interest, they can quickly learn the notations, forms, and relations of that system. This may seem obvious, but "People are likely to be better at learning and using computer languages that closely match their interests and their domain knowledge."

So pick something you like to learn about, and don't assume learning has to be hard in order to "count"!

At Code Collective, we co-work, co-teach, co-learn. Teaching others helps us learn. Sometimes the teaching looks more like wayfinding together. 

Collaboration, not competition. "Care over careful"

## 6. We stay gelatinous [flexible, spongy, fluid, adjustable]

### Acknowledge context together

And we acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals; our choices have histories, they come with politics attached.

We don’t dismiss hierarchy out of hand, but acknowledge and work to address it by meeting each other where we are and valuing what each can contribute to another’s knowledge, and to better and more diverse computational systems.

**Situatedness*

We don’t assume we *should* code something just because we can. 

Through conversations about what we’re making and imagining, I try to model an artistic research practice that integrates the critical and creative, prioritizing dialogue exchange over prescriptive lecture, comfort with uncertainty and multiple approaches.

Very quickly the personal becomes political and our work easily extends beyond ourselves, to engage algorithmic bias and other issues in computation that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally. 

>>"Situated Computation is an approach to computational design that grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and political structures that shape it." 
>(Dr. Vernelle A. A. Noel)

>>"when communities are faced with new technological solutions to existing problems, to ask what these techniques may prevent and not only to check what the techniques promise to do." —Ursula M. Franklin @franklinRealWorldTechnology2004

Another way we think about context is to not dismiss ideas before they get off the ground. We stay excited by the impossibly large tasks and the incredibly small ones, knowing everything is connected. Knowing how 'way leads on to way', the tiny tangents always bring us back to the big issues, and the impossible pataphysical pursuits have a way of revealing practical applications when pursued.


### Address difference and power

Aligned in our interest in coding, we see our many differences as strengths and opportunities to learn from one another. We are committed to interdisciplinary, intersectional, iterative making. We make sure this is embedded in and extends beyond our own work, through our gatherings [...] [by including workshops and group research that focuses on algorithmic bias and other issues in computation that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally.]

### Ask 'why' and 'how' not just 'what' to make



Ask yourself: What do you want to make? What resources do you need to get there? /*More importantly, *why* do you want to put it in the world?*/ [xxxmovebelow?]


### Adjust for what's needed

What are the basics people need to get in the door and be comfortable there? Hold meetings at times people can show up. Are you including community members who have multiple jobs, at odd hours? Children they need to bring along? Consider how you can account for this with scheduling during days, evenings, weekends, hybrid meetings. Maybe you can provide childcare through mutual aid partnerships or rotate duties. 

How else can you share responsibilities of organizing and supporting your gatherings? 

### Meet folks where they are

I may not care for their approach or their aesthetic — or their politics! But I still *try* to start by understanding what they want to make and why. I do ask questions intended to challenge those approaches and aesthetics (and sometimes politics), but my goal is not to change their mind or make them do it my way. My goal is to make space for them to see more options they might not have considered before, and to help them explore the options they choose in mindful ways. 

This approach helps more people feel welcome in our meetups. Often it also shifts their stance and their practice in the direction of making more critical and compassionate work. [quote]

>"A lot of the the values that I was trying to hold on to would be a lot harder for me to hold on to without Code Collective. 
>"Even [another member] who was confronted with opportunities to profit immensely off NFTs, but decided not to because of Code Collective, because when she was thinking about these ideas, she could see other people who are also using code in the creative manner. So it actively shaped the ethics of individuals who have exceptional power with their [work]."
>"I can see Code Collective as a way to reinforce ethics — and without imposing them. [No one went to [her] and said, 'What you're doing is wrong.' We said, 'Oh, like it sounds like you're having mixed feelings about this. Let's talk about it.' Or she was very vocal, but we were all interested in it and had dynamic conversations around it.] It was never like, 'don't do that, what are you doing' but definitely a space to hold all the possibilities around it, which I really appreciate. I know you and I have gotten into like some heated conversations which I really enjoy. But there's a lot of respect there to hold all of the opposing ideas. The dialectical is the value."

>"It's almost like an opportunity cost, like if Code Collective wasn't there, I would be working for Palantine or something right now, I'd be using this mind towards — I wouldn't even call it destruction but I would have lost a lot.

>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

If someone comes in with an opposing idea, let's talk about it. Tell us what's interesting to you about that. Show us how you're thinking about that. Maybe we disagree, but we're interested to know where you're coming from. We can hold space for multiple opposing ideas. My approach is somewhere between scrappy "dialectics" (dialogue and questioning) and "negative capability" (staying with uncertainties and doubts, without reaching for answers).

### Value many forms [& tools]
[craft] [zines]
[cite][munisp5zine]

>@ender "I care about the process of making the zine, but I care even more about what the zine does."

At various points, Code Collective has also been Zine Club, which has also been Crochet & Knitting Club. Even though I became interested in each of these topics independently of the group, our interests in common have found each other and the Code Collective format has been an adaptable shape to embrace them all. It's wildly transformable.  

>"Writing elegant code requires all of the same components as crafting. There is absolutely skill, sophisticated technique, and technical knowledge required to be successful in the field. In both cases, we are using our hands and our brains to create something for others to enjoy. When thinking about code as a craft, we can look to the crafting community for ways to improve our industry." (Mercedes Bernard, @CrochetCodeCraft)

>"Newsletters were a kind of connective tissue that made readers aware of the larger information infrastructure lesbian feminists were building. [...] the network idea animated the newsletter’s communicative functions (35) [...] a lesbian-feminist mode of network t ing animates small-scale newsletters that draw on the language and practice of networking. These newsletters were published between the early 1970s and the mid 1990s," (36)(McKinney-Information Activism)


### Choose the right tool for the job

Sometimes we have to build it. Content is liquid; it will take the form of its container. It takes shape based on what the tools used can allow. Carefully choose tools and forms that share the values you want your work to embody. 

It takes shape within the limits of the affordances of one's tools. [rephrase] The capacities of the tools we choose set limits for our capacities to create. If I choose a saw, I may be able to build a birdhouse but won't be able to write an essay.

## 7. We dream impossibly big *and* impressively tiny, too.

We're both excited for both impossibly large possibilities and also obsessed with tiny charming tasks. [xxxMore]

Do you know that sneaky feeling an idea should already exist? It might mean you are just the person to create it. Or that other sneaky feeling that an idea is too impossibly far-fetched, that you are the only one who would want it? That *still* might mean you should pursue it. Remember if you're interested in something, others will be too! We are the people best suited to bring our own visions to life.


### Critical dreaming

Set aside your doubts and questions——what would you make if you could make anything, and why? 

It's true there's a lot to be said for the smallest viable prototype. Sure. But sometimes we can't help ourselves. We love to dream wildly. We'll figure out the impractical later and the impossible after that. Sometimes critical dreaming gets us where we need to go by overshooting so vastly we end up somewhere new. 

Scaling down can come later. Dream big!

#### Critical tinkering 

Choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away. 

These small things are seeds. We don't know what they might grow into but we trust they will grow: *"Everything small and buried surrenders to a process that none of the buried parts can see."*[^nepo] Sometimes they grow into the coolest things you'd never expect. Trust that they will (eventually) circle back and relate to the bigger things you are investigating. Follow that rabbit down the hole!

## 8. We create rituals together

A combination of consistency and loose structure has served us best. 

We have adapted to the needs and circumstances of the community, continually. We strive for the loosest container possible to hold the thing together. 

Start with a round of check-ins: What are you making? What are you into right now? How are you doing, really?

Snacks and music and movement. Seriously, snacks are essential. 

Aim for consistency and flexibility through a steady mix of in-person meetings and online connection. 

These literally *make* the space we have together.

We are pretty free-form, but one of our structures has been open with a ritual of checking in on each other, asking what we are working on and thinking about. That short process often guides the rest of our weekly agenda because it’s space to take the temperature of the group, find out what code questions need investigating or troubleshooting, or for that matter what life questions too. 

Our other structures include a collaborative playlist that always kicks off with Queen (which was not my doing but I have fully embraced it as you can tell), as well as oodles of snacks to lure folks in. 

We also keep a weekly meeting cadence but this has gone from in-person to zoom to to back again, by way of various more fun video platforms, alongside an asynchronous Discord forums. 

The main takeaway is that we have adapted to the needs and circumstances of the community over the past three years, striving for the loosest container possible to hold the thing together. 

>SAMIR says: "It is more like a French salon where it's like, 'let's like hang out eat, and talk about code.' [...] but it's of consequence in these meetings. People do make huge strides in their projects, or solve crazy problems."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

The examples I offer here are often in flux as the temperaments and conditions of our members change. Fundamentally, we create ways of being together and acknowledging each others common humanity and unique perspectives simultaneously. We mark the specialness of contact and connection. Often this happens by accident and then codifies (code-ifies!) into a pattern we keep. Try and adjust until you find what works for you!

### Meet regularly

Meet weekly if possible, in person if possible, and accommodate what's not always possible. Stay flexible to the impossible and know you'll get back to it later. Like old friends you can pick up with after an indeterminate amount of time, no questions asked. Or old code that needs a break from you after troubleshooting for too long. Trust that you can come back together, without pressure or resentment or guilt. It's not meant to be another obligation on the calendar, but a reprieve. 

We help restore each other through co-presence. We defrag each other's mental hard disks through the process of communing.  

A frequent, consistent cadence of meeting in person is best. But the truth is, you don’t need to prepare much just to start building community. 

We've been lucky to have space to be self-selecting participants, figuring out what this is together. People find us by word of mouth, no prostheletizing (we're too lazy for that). We simply have our meetings in a semi-public space like a library lab. People can walk by and see what we are doing, ask if they can join, and we've had long-time members who found us this way. There are no prerequisites or fees. 

Still, it's possible to incorporate some of these approaches in a required classroom setting or work environment too. 

**core group, self selecting, figuring out what it is. problem-membership, not prostheletizing. word of mouth. public space, what are you doing, can i join? no cap, joseph beuys** humility, self conscious self deprecating, not warranted. 

This literally *makes* the room for each other, creates the room we have together [see we ask after each other #10]

### Show and tell / Take temperature with check ins

Or Round Robin, or Check Ins, or Council Method, or some version of an opening gesture for our gathering that acknowledges each person, gives them a short couple of minutes to share anything they want to share today. It could be how they are feeling, what they might be working on, a success or a struggle, something they've read or seen in the wild. By the time we've completed the circle we almost always have a clear trajectory for the rest of the day's meetup and are well into our first conversation or troubleshoot. We have also made room for each person, whether they are shy and would otherwise be steamrolled, or whether they would be first to speak and might otherwise share first each visit.   

### Make room for each other, make time

We set a timer for our check-ins, not to limit time for some people but to make time for everyone. This also has a flattening effect, where a full professor who joins gets the same three minutes as a first-year undergraduate. Both can talk about what they're working on, struggling with, or excited about this week. 

In live-coders Olivia Jack and Bruno Gola's Berlin-based hack night, Show Us Your Screens, everyone gets ten minutes to perform or present their computational art or music. This ten minutes includes setup time. "We project the timer on the ceiling. When it goes off, you're done. It changes color and everyone claps," says Jack, who is the creator of the Hydra live-coding language for networked visuals. "The setup is sometimes the most elaborate part of the performance." 

### Believe in snacks

Without fail, when I asked what makes our community thrive, everyone said: SNACKS! Support snacks at all costs. Snacks are magic. How do snacks do it? I don't know, ask snacks. Make sure you budget for snacks.

>"While this is a cliche food has always brought people together. Snacking together in the basement brought out some of the best discussions and ideas I have entertained in college." 
>>—Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science

>"I think the snacks were definitely a big draw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

>"I think I think food was a huge component. It brings people together, it puts people on the same level. Whenever people dine together, it levels the playing field, and it kind of brings a sense of equality. That's important."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

Look for snacks that are computer keyboard friendly – nothing too sticky, no tipsy liquids. A mix of salty and sweet is good, a mix of healthful and less-than-healthful. Single-serving items that avoid much plastic wrapping are ideal: satsuma oranges,  popcorn, pretzels, gummies. If you have a Trader Joes in your area, we recommend the Sour Scandanavian Swimmers. 

As our meetings transitioned to virtual spaces and across timezones, snacks still held sway as a conversation starter. Then, on return to a campus strictly regulated with no-food policies and mask-wearing, our beloved snacks were off the table (occasionally under the table, instead). Whether piled in the center of the table, dutifully taken outside, or discussed in their glaring absence, snacks represent the friendly core of the space. The snack breaks are where the best thinking and connections get made. They are a reminder that we are not coding machines but fleshy bodies connected by our need to take breaks to digest and recharge. As we chew and chat, we digest and discuss what we're troubleshooting (both in code and life). It's all part of the processing. 

### Share playlists

And our playlists are on point! The Creative Code Collective theme song is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now." At our first meetup, I asked if folks would like background music while we worked, and a quiet student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion. I was blown away. And "Don't Stop Me Now" has been our rallying call ever since. 

A collaborative [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/sarahciston/playlist/2g6F9RM0Osbhw7ONwxSJhy?si=Cr0nEeExQiKPUQI-l7-HCA) on your open streaming platform of choice can not only offer some comfortable and energizing background noise while you work, it's another way to come together around something *other* than code. Anything that levels the field for participants and makes broader connections supports the community in general and when coding. It's all connected! 

>"The terminal is cute. It's important to have a good relationship with your terminal." 
>>(Ada)

### Keep things loose

It has been one of my biggest stresses about our Collective learning how to lead. Because leadership feels like a responsibility I take seriously, but also a spotlight or a pedestal I'm wary of, this leadership feels like a tightrope walk in which I try nervously to make sure everyone is comfortable, having fun, and learning—all without forcing anything or having it "look like" anything is happening at all.

Of course, this does not work. That nervous strategy is riddled with stilted efforts of over-structured efforts leading to dead silence and loosey-goosey meandering conversations. Along the way I am continually learning the caring practices of facilitation as leadership, as being a vessel and a model. The space is a loose net—some structure is in fact necessary, though I was loathe to be the instigator of that structure at first. 

>Elea: "Can I go on a tangent?" 
>Sarah: "Always."

GIFs, TikToks, whatever's your thing... what brings a smile to your face and a sense of levity to the experience? What can you connect around? How can we not take ourselves so seriously even as we engage in the serious business of reimagining the world?

## 9. We share [resources]

We share resources, honor emotional labor and the labor of documentation as essential parts of coding, and don't take for granted what feels intuitive or close to our hearts. 

### Foreground accessibility

Adapting our systems to our particular needs and those of others tends to make those systems more accessible for everyone. 

Anything that allows you or prevents you from participating is a factor of access. This can include physical accessibility, knowledge and language inclusion, the many intersectional aspects of diversity, and more. The open-source software community P5.js took an active approach to access when they declared in 2019 that they would only build in new features to their software that supported increased access. They have included increasing support for translation, assistive tech, friendly error messages and contributor resources, and mentorship of historically excluded communities all under this umbrella of their [Focus on Access](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/contributor_docs/access.md). 

Provide an accessibility description of your space. This is something I have not been good at in the past, because I have been able to take for granted that I can reach a building, get inside, be somewhat comfortable when I am there. As aspects of that priviledge change for me (and the ones that don't) I realize how helpful it is to know in advance what to expect or if it's worth trying to go at all: What will be provided? What cannot be provided at this time? Who is the point of contact for questions about access? Here is an example of an accessibility outline from [varia](https://vvvvvvaria.org/en/pages/accessibility.html) in Rotterdam.

The same is true of the digital spaces we create. Putting access first creates features that support everyone. Addressing the problems of the marginalized majority — from alt text to [XXXX to XXXX] — offers multiple points of entry for many people. 

More resources on digital accessibility were highlighted during [p5 Access Day 2022](https://p5js.org/community/p5js-access-day-2022.html).

### Minimal is accessible

Sometimes the low-fi answer is the right one. When searching for the right tools to build the Creative Code Collective Resource Hub, we went through every possible solution for a database, and landed on a google doc. When looking for ways to build the site for the Intersectional AI Toolkit, again we went through what seemed like endless possibilities for platforms, and landed back at simple JAM stack static sites, github pages, or wiki. Sometimes the less ambitious choices serve different purposes. They offer more access to other audiences. They leave the content and data more open and adaptable and legible to friends who might want to interact with it later, or to us as we build or rebuild it one day. We embrace minimal computing [cite] as an accessible and aesthetic and political value. 


**That was always the question: What's the minimal structure necessary to make people feel like they have a container that is safe, and that gives them freedom to move? What's the foundation you need to have to facilitate, to have spaciousness. But you still need a foundation. You still need a a safe structure.**

### Choose open source, freely available, easily adaptable tools wherever possible

Radical openness. 

### Cite out of love

We cite and celebrate those who inspire what we do.

We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable, minimal tools that don't hide how they work.

We use what we make as an opportunity to share what we've learned along the way——archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, *zines*——thinking and making always happen in community. 

I looked to models like the Processing and P5js community that puts emphasis on access and connecting new coders with approachable information in multiple mediums. When starting the collective we went with a basic google team drive and a disorganized collection of links to tutorials and cool projects, some collaborative meeting notes, and called it a Hub.

Since then, the Resource Hub idea has expanded into its own group project. We spent many hours troubleshooting as a group to bring it to life, with Katherine Yang at the helm. It represents our group identity and our approach to sharing information and the way we work as well. In the hub and in our projects, we emphasize open-source and open-access tools. Anyone can contribute a resource that they’ve found useful, and can search by keywords from technical skills to critical concepts or random combinations thereof as a creative provocation. 

As students move on into the world, I’m working to document our values and  imagining how to expand outside the institution and welcoming members via Discord, starting new chapters at other universities and in other cities. And I’m starting to document our approaches slightly more formally as a zine and guidebook.

I’m not taking credit for any of these approaches being novel; in fact, in some ways, they are so instinctual they are easily dismissed—but they are too important to be overlooked, when they contribute so much to learning environments that support a variety of expression and creation. 

>KATHERINE says: “It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of, "Okay, [...] you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code.”


### Keep track of what we already know, rather than duplicate our work

This started as a Google Doc where anyone could dump a link. It has grown into a full-fledged database, which we iterated on together during group troubleshooting sessions. Then rethought it again as a simple spreadsheet and form to feed the website. It has had many versions. Whether you make a wiki or cover the wall in sticky notes or use the latest sharing platforms all synched up to your phones, finding a free and open way to share information with one another—the lower the barrier the entry the better. There's always a tension between how structured or unstructured to make it (enough so people know where to put things and find things, not so much that they can't imagine new things that don't fit the existing form).


### Value documentation and/as care work
#### documentation is hard work, necessary work, just as essential as the code itself

* collaborative notetaking in a shared etherpad or team doc
* starting a website together, posting your individual sketches or projects on a group github

## 10. We encode our values

### Start with care 💜 before code

see Chapter 510's "care over careful" meaning care-ful with each other but not with worry about getting it "right" in a perfectionist sense. Perfectionism is white supremacy. [XXXcite] 

#### why care

Care and compassion are infinite but neglected resources, literally life sustaining resources that renew themselves with use. 

>"Care is the practice of savouring how subtle differences can make all the difference."
>>[Data Loam.](http://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110697841/html) (2020). In J. Golding, M. Reinhart, & M. Paganelli (Eds.), De Gruyter. 

>"What happens when we integrate rather than refuse the pain, toil, and doom of surviving? How do we put our interconnectedness into practice?"
>>– Johanna Hedva

A practice for revolutions: *"Wherever you are standing, come one step closer."*[^@morehshin]

We are building community. We are encoding our values. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." We imagine how things could be otherwise. 

All making is a research question. 

What question do you want to explore? 



### Make room for each other
<!--- is this one in encode our values? --->

>"It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like, "Okay, you don't have to be that, you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code."**
>>-Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science


#### Homebrew & sisterspit

If the space / tool / resource / artwork you want does not exist, create it. If you need it, someone else does too.

Examples like [Homebrew Computer Club](), [Chaos Computer Club](), [Sister Spit (now Resplendent Tonguesplitters)](https://www.spin.com/2022/08/we-knew-we-were-pissed/) all show how a few folks with a wacky idea can bloom into work that is appreciated by many, many people. 

Steve Wozniak described the start of Homebrew Computer Club: "we weren't official and we weren't formal. Our leader [...] would get up at every meeting and announce the convening of 'the Homebrew Computer Club which does not exist' and everyone would applaud happily." 

### Ask after one another

>"We reassemble ourselves through the ordinary, everyday, and often painstaking work of looking after ourselves; looking after each other."
>>-Sarah Ahmed, *Living a Feminist Life*

We are excited to know each other and to care for one another as people, not as a means to an end. We learn from each other and our skills improve because of each other, but time and again we realize that is not the only—or even the main—reason we come together. 


I've learned that building communities through creative code, developing an ethics of coding care means to me a focus on …
* the scrappy: imperfect, iterative, vulnerable 
* the collaborative: co-teaching & co learning, embedded and situated, accounting for hierarchy, with and for community
* the embodied and entangled: meeting people where they are, with the material and experiences they have, merging theory and content with code and practice. choosing and sharing tools that are ethically and conceptually grounded

I have learned... 

**Persistence is a rhythm, not a slog.**  

**I can hold my pedagogy and my programming more loosely and they both become more pleasurable**. 

**When I foreground care and connection, the rest happens.**

For me, seeing students who thought they hated code return the next semester referring to themselves as coders—seeing them share projects that express a distinctive critical voice—affirms for me the importance of this kind of community and this combination of intersectional and interdisciplinary tactics for learning. And I’m starting to see the impacts it can have on their views of algorithmic systems and potential alternate futures.



<!--- We're conscious of taking up space. --->

### Continue becoming more ourselves

<!--- Experiences of becoming 'more ourselves' [...] --->

We gather as part of this effort, and we have started to trust each other with the care and feeding required to take on this continual work. We reveal ourselves, maybe slowly at first. By sharing the things we make or want to make, we share what we care about, who we care for, our politics. We get glimpses of each others homes and families and pets. We see each other chew with our mouths full or sweaty on arrival or frustrated to figure out a problem.  



### Remember we are not (only) in class. We're in community.

Community can sometimes feel like an easy word, even a dirty word, the way it gets lobbed about by not-always-well-meaning folks who might be making a lot of presumptions when they try to argue "we're all in this together." Sometimes we're not. Sometimes we are not a "we" at all. Many folks have been hurt by this kind of co-option of language, and it makes sense to limit our trust to those who earn it. 

Real community, solidarity, [etc] is about mutual inter-reliance, not extraction. 

>"The idea of it has always been to create a space where you don't have to know everything. And it's not like class where you come and everyone's working towards one point, and how good you are is it is defined by how well you know the technology, how well you can do something. Because the club is inherently multidisciplinary, so people will have different strengths, a different background."
>>-Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

We strike a balance that is neither the top-down hierarchy of a classroom nor the chaos of a "hierarchy-less" blob. We acknowledge the power dynamics at play and actively address them, working to help folks feel welcoming in community.

Our community is less about how it appears to outsiders than how it feels while inside it, except in the sense of inviting folks in. 

[...]

We fly under the radar. we are a rag-tag troupe of misfits, a dead poets' society, a secret laboratory, a not-so-secret guild.

Our mascots are magpies and meme cats, too-clever animals fascinated with hoarding shiny objects and causing a little trouble. We look to jellyfish and labyrinths for their translucent flexibility, their decentralized nervous systems, their twisty turny mystery and ability to go deep. 

Still we want to find openings for others to enter, [...]

>"I'd love to see this outside of the university setting. I wish this existed for urban professionals. I feel like not all of my Silicon Valley friends would partake in something like this, because they're so burnt out on code. But I'm sure there's a lot of people that are still wanting to have this conversation."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

[xxx][intro or conclusion or values]

What are the bricks, the building blocks, the core modules of a community like this one? What are the minimum foundations needed to support the space, to let people grow their craft their own way and flexibly flourish? 

Some items we have considered, or intuitively incorporated:

#### • Knowledge sharing repository/hub
#### • Steady cadence, ritual of gathering
#### • Material care & physical contact/resources
#### • Inclusive, iterative & recursive, inquisitive and embracing approaches

If it doesn't exist, we ask if it should. And if it does exist, we still ask if it should (or shouldn't). We ask how could it be otherwise. 

*All making is a research question.* All theory is theory–practice. All practice is theory–practice. Which is to say, our reading and thinking saturates what creative choices we make, what materials we use, how we speak about what we do. This is true even if unconscious. And so we choose to acknowledge this and do so mindfully. 

Our creative choices and materials and our work in our bodies saturates our reading and thinking, our vocabularies, our points of reference, our critical tools, our communities of practice. These are recursive and reciprocal and iterative. Making is always a research question about how to live.
[[insert figure]]   


[...]

We make coded things in order to connect with others, to bridge the ephemeral spark gaps of language and feeling and being separate creatures trying to reach each other. We make things hoping someone thinks they're kind of cool. 

We write code in order to decode the systems that ... [encumber us]

*We refuse to be outsiders in the systems that injure us or ignore us.* We reject notions of intimidation or gatekeeping that deny creativity, joy, politics, and purposes that reach beyond perpetuating white-supremacist capitalist status quo. 

When we say we, we write for the parts of ourselves that have been neglected or ignored, a habit we learned too early, a trick imposed upon us and repeated. ~~When we say we, we claim this audaciously and unapologetically, and hope you feel it too, but you don't have to.~~










<!-- [How to Fork a Book](https://markcmarino.medium.com/how-to-fork-a-book-the-radical-transformation-of-publishing-3e1f4a39a66c) by Sarah Ciston and Mark C. Marino , we talk about a "yes, and" ethos and add "Code Confessions" and "Code Commentaries." "Code Confessions reflect on our experiences starting to learn to program, while Code Commentaries do critical close-readings of source code, an approach that comes from the Critical Code Studies discipline. Code Confessions are opportunities to further humanize the process of writing code by talking about our embodied, emotional encounters with the process of programming: How it felt to work on this code or to encounter the same issues readers might during their practice. Meanwhile, Code Commentaries are opportunities to pursue the methods of Critical Code Studies by interpreting the meaning of the code on the page, line by line."   "we model how we as programmers feel about our own code. Extending the concept of comments in code, we take the opportunity to discuss the affective relationship to the journey that is programming, admitting to mistakes and acknowledging fears. These sections personalize the approach and dismantle the authoritarian hierarchy or boundary between knowledge “holder” and knowledge “seeker.” This aspect was essential to emphasize the ways we learn in community, revealing that the teacher programmer didn’t always know what they’re doing and may still find their way with a beginner’s mindset. The code confessions sections are expressions of humility in an effort to further welcome the newcomer. They stand opposed to encoded chauvinism, or the toxic brogrammer culture that can be so off-putting to new programmers, especially those who come from outside the dominant culture."-->

<!-- # **The Coding Care Zine**

[Original Zine Draft](assets/img/CodingCareZine.pdf)

>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways." 
>>–adrienne maree brown

*Coding Care* 

## we come from anywhere

We don't always fit in. Artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders, CS majors, never-ever-coders, writers, dancers. linguists, neuroscientists, trans kids, queer folks, staff and teachers, we all find different ways into code and community.

## we are always works in progress

Many of the routes that got us here have been struggles. Learning to code is filled with false starts for so many people, and when we don't talk about it, it's easy to feel alone. So is learning to be in the world. There is no final state; there is ongoing learning. We need spaces that support all kinds of learning. 

## we create who we are together

What does this particular cluster of beings need and desire from this gathering? What do we stand for? We define it and redefine it for ourselves. 

## we find our way together

Scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code. Growth not perfection. Collaboration not competition. 

When it doesn't exist, we build it! We make it from other tools we scrap for parts. We break it to learn how it works, and why. 

We meet folks where they are, no code snobs, no stupid questions. 

## we ~~embrace~~ highlight our mistakes

Sharing our struggles both helps us solve them by team troubleshooting *and* shows us and others that we are not alone with coding challenges. Being vulnerable makes us stronger and brings us closer. 

## we all have skills to teach each other

Tell us something you know about! Tell us something you'd like to learn!

co-teach | co-learn | co-work | co-create

Everyone has a perspective, and no one knows everything.

## we're excited for the impossibly large possibilities, and the tiny charming tasks, too

Set aside your doubts and questions——what would you make if you could make anything, and why? Scaling down can come later. Dream big!

Small seeds of ideas you can start right away can grow into the coolest things. Follow that rabbit down the hole!

## we ask WHY, WHO, HOW, not only WHAT to make

And we acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals; our choices have histories, they come with politics attached.

## we make room for each other

We're conscious of taking up space.

## we ask after one another

## we make our own rituals

Start with a round of check-ins: What are you making? What are you into right now? How are you doing, really?

Snacks and music and movement. Seriously, snacks are essential. 

Aim for consistency and flexibility through a steady mix of in-person meetings and online connection. 

These literally *make* the space we have together.

## we think open source

We share resources, honor emotional labor and the labor of documentation as essential parts of coding, and don't take for granted what feels intuitive or close to our hearts. 

We cite and celebrate those who inspire what we do.

We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable, minimal tools that don't hide how they work.

We use what we make as an opportunity to share what we've learned along the way——archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, *zines*——thinking and making always happen in community. 

## we start with care 💜

We are building community. We are encoding values. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." We imagine how things could be otherwise. 

All making is a research question. What question do you want to explore?
