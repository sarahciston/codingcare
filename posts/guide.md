### Rough starts & disconnects

Have you considered learning to code but felt too intimidated to try? Have you struggled to program? Or don't know how to apply what you've learned to things you care about? <!-- or to understand how you'd actually use it?--> Maybe you're decent with programming skills but you'd still never consider yourself a 'coder'. *Coding Care* is about bridging this disconnect——the wide gulf between trying to learn coding and feeling empowered to create with code. <!-- (even though we likely interact with computation every day).--> 

>"the prospect of a language that is both hidden and alien to me haunts my work on the net. Like most prejudices, it is born out of fear. I am afraid of what lies buried within the under text"
>>Jessica Loseby, "Code Scares Me"

So many people feel left out of coding communities and spaces for learning about computation. But I believe it is essential for people who come from all different perspectives to share access to the digital languages which are altering the world and what it becomes. *I* want to live in a world that is shaped by *your* point of view and many others' point of views — not a world shaped only by one narrow take on what computers can be and do. 

>"I was that convinced that I didn’t have the ability or technological talent to learn how to write code for something. I assumed that every person around me was miles ahead in their practice, and wondered how my passion for creative storytelling could really play into something so new and untouched." 
>>Tia Kemp, she/her, BA USC Media Arts + Practice

### Don't stop me now

My own first experiences learning to code felt *awful*. Lonely. Discouraging. Confusing. I had the sense I was "supposed" to learn programming skills. It felt important, like I needed these tools in order to create the kind of art and language and world I imagined — but it also felt like an insurmountable chore. I had the sense everyone else could hack it but me: *Why was I the only one who didn't understand (or care!) about these dry, boring examples? Why was I getting lost in all the confusing, specialized vocabularies?* I felt thrown into a strange landscape——I lacked even the words to ask for what I needed, a basic knowledge of where to look, or an instinct for how to start. 

I wish I had known then that learning to code didn't have to feel like getting stuck. It didn't have to feel like I was fitting myself into someone else's stencil shape of a stereotypical engineer. I wish I had known that learning to code could feel like this:

![Freddie Mercury](../assets/img/freddie.gif)

Coding has helped me feel powerful and imaginative, sometimes even unstoppable. I learned (eventually, through trial and error)(and error and error) that coding can be fun — even playful, relaxed, welcoming. It can be creative, thoughtful, crafty. 

Once I accepted that the false starts and frustrations of learning to code are part of the process for *everyone*, that these don't make us 'not real coders', I began to push through these struggles more easily. Whenever I persist with coding, I find it rewards my effort with community connections, creative revelations, and more puzzling challenges. 

I have learned I can make coding my own, and that anyone else can too. This guide talks about how to nurture the supportive spaces that make this sparkly code feeling possible.

<!-- problem statement -->
#### (En)coding rituals: What are the practices of coding communities? 

Code is language and code is a tool for expressing and enacting combined. But coding has "belonged" to far too few for far too long, while the rest of us are considered outsiders to the encoded systems that consume us.

Current rituals and protocols around programming are stale: The stereotype of the hacker in a cave, clacking away at high speed as glyphs flash on a dark screen. The gray-hoodied employees playing ping pong in the office park, building rational white robots and ever-helpful femmebots. The black box that obscures machine learning's inner workings with hype, mysticism, and elitism.

This guidebook wants to enrich the rituals of programming to include the joy, community, and care necessary to make different kinds of code — and different kinds of worlds. It explores the practices of and in communities which are feeding new kinds of code and new kinds of coders that can [change the world]. [xxx]

### Code isn't magic, but we are

>"No way, code is magic." 
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

I believe in our power to reshape the world around us by experimenting wildly with the kinds of code, tools, aesthetics, and ethics we want to see. Although making a piece of code finally work certainly feels like magic, I keep learning that this magic comes from *us*. It does not from automated or autonomous systems, from the next hyped tech, or [xxxxx], which have always been deeply intertwined with humans in every way. 

* How do we bring our magic to the systems we want to affect? 
* How do we change systems to suit us if we are stuck outside them – without conforming to their encoded ways of thinking? 
* How can we build communities that facilitate alternatives? 

These are the open questions explored by this guide — and explored every time we practice code-making in community.

[xxxadd:] What this guidebook isn't / Why is this guidebook

### Code as collective: An open question

### aka What's in this pocket guide? What's a code collective and how do I get one?

Creative Code Collective is the community I started in early 2019 for media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I sent out a call, because I was looking for others who were struggling with code same as I was, and I hoped there might be another way — at the very least, we could struggle together. 😬 We launched with the mottos: **"Scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code"** and **"We all have skills to teach each other."**

Throughout the guide I'll share what I've learned while building Code Collective — about coding, connecting, and building collectives. The guide honors and draws from the many mentors and teachers who have inspired it, gathering many resources found along the way. Of course the guide includes many reflections and contributions from community members — including coding examples and exercises, favorite projects and personal accounts — because this work is never done in isolation. I'll discuss connections I've found between coding and other crafts like zine publishing and fiber arts. I'll also discuss connections to open-source, open-access, and activist movements that shape the approach to how we gather and what we create. The guide is a melange of materials and methods, hopefully a spark of inspiration and the start of many conversations around these ideas. 

I am writing both as a representative of this community and also as an individual greatly influenced by it and by so many other creators, thinkers, and teachers. I want to document our work processes and thought processes, and to honor the many entangling threads that go into shaping a caring (coding) community. 

The heart of this book are [ten] principles that have emerged through gathering as Code Collective. They are simple tactics for anyone to employ in their own community practices — or adapt to suit them. Developing these tactics has been intuitive, iterative, and collaborative. They emerged out of desire and instinct. We have expanded and distilled these tactics influenced by other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more; and we have reshaped them continually as our group evolves. All recommendations in the book are intended to be descriptive, not prescriptive. Here's what has worked for us (and what hasn't). I invite you to embrace and adapt what works for you and leave the rest. And I am interested in how these tactics change in different circumstances, so if you find something that works better for you, I'd be excited to learn about it too! 

>>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways" (adrienne maree brown 2021, 117)

Many of the things we do to sustain supportive communities seem too obvious to mention——or even worse, too obvious to notice — such that they aren't obvious *at all*. This guide is meant to remind me that these approaches matter, and to acknowledge how much they have supported me and others along the way. This guide celebrates those ephemeral things that make our caring coding community go. *It tries to describe our intuitive wayfinding about how to learn and teach and explore and be together, especially in and through the very things that both draw us in and also scare us, the things that feel both challenging and fun, frustrating and rewarding.*

It is not one gesture or one moment, but their accumulation. Each thing we have done intentionally, and unintentionally, adds up to *us*. To collect, to gather, to hoard like magpies. To embrace fascination with the shiny objects even when we don't yet know their purpose. To trust their meaning in our gut. To trust connections with other people. To rely on each other, to reconnect again and again, over the smallest things. To be vulnerable in shared struggle, shared silliness, shared delight. 

### Man(ifest)ual (manualifesto) & what this pocket guide isn't

This guide is not a manifesto, as much as I love a manifesto. Johanna Hedva says, "a manifesto is only ever a document that reaches too far, that speculates too impossibly, and that the only use a manifesto can have is to lay bare why it cannot be manifested, to open itself to all the ways its un-manifestation shapes the world" [^hedva2022]@hedvaWhyItTaking – yet here I document what we've actually put in the world, alongside what we hope to. Code Collective exists because I believe it is incredibly easy to have communities like this, and I am not the only one. Like code itself, and Code Collective, this guide strives to bring the "impossible" into the "real world" now – as a proposition toward how it can be entirely possible, present, liveable, and thriving. Anarchists call this "prefiguration" but we can just call it fun. And so the pocket guide exists somewhere between a manifesto and a manual. Make of it what you will; I hope you do!

## 1. We create who we are together

>"What I like about code collective is that it's a community of friends as well as resources. That's where I can feel like we're all going on a journey of learning and discovery together."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

Code Collective is a self-organizing community of artists, makers, students, people from all backgrounds——especially including those who have not done much or any coding before. We meet regularly to develop our programming practices in a flexible, co-working, co-learning setting.

I started organizing the collective as an intervention. I craved a space where I felt welcome and free to explore without constraint, after experiencing how programming cultures had intimidated me and after witnessing how they had discouraged so many others. I noticed the need for supportive spaces that could value diverse capacities to learn. After my own struggles learning to code, and after a few joyful experiences that showed me it could be otherwise, I wanted to make space for anyone else struggling to find their fit, convinced there was no place for them in the existing systems. 

I had run up against the feeling that I was not making sense, because no one could understand what I was trying to make or do. Often I was not sure myself--it was only a gut feeling, a glimmer that drew me toward tinkering even when I kept hitting walls, getting frustrated, hearing that it shouldn't or couldn't be done.

Now I remind new visitors to Code Collective: *If you have an inkling (or a fear) that coding might be for you, it probably is. Welcome.* 
<!-- In this way, coding is like queerness. -->

<!-- ### who are we? -->
We are artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders, computer science majors, writers, dancers, linguists, neuroscientists, trans kids, queer folks, refugees, parents, staff and teachers, independent learners. We come from all career stages and from all levels of expertise. We come from many cultures, sexualities, classes, and genders. Many of us do not come to programming from a STEM-education pipeline. Our interests exceed the bounds of what our specializations offer and what our vocabularies describe. We all find different ways into code and community.

>"For me, I could figure out how to code but I didn't really know what to use for what, and for the specific things I like. Also part of the issues here is there's so many things you could do, right?"
>Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science

### how do we create who we are? 

Upon gathering, I ask myself: What does this particular cluster of beings need and desire from this gathering? What do we stand for? We get to define it and redefine it for ourselves. At our first meeting, attendees cited a mix of desires for joining what would become Code Collective:

* "to learn what language is used for what"
* "not to be intimidated to try something new"
* "see what others do, have a set time to work on projects and keep skills sharp"
* "not to check the assigned boxes but find an artistic approach. make stuff"
* "ask questions"
* "see others projects and help"
* "see weird projects and find interesting solutions"
* "have an accountability space and a brain trust with shared expertise"
* "conquer my trouble starting and finishing. bounce ideas off of others. build something I'm proud of"

To explore how we might best create community, I asked each person to share what they were currently working on, some topics they knew about, some topics they wanted to know about. The goal here was to look for any overlaps. Where what you know about and what I want to know about intersect? Here lies magic!

As time has gone on, our needs have changed, and our formats and structures have kept pace. We moved from conversations about possible group projects, mission statements, and organizational concerns toward a more freeform agenda, toward a blend of form and freedom that holds space for anyone's individual projects and needs during that meeting time.

### in process, continually works in progress // value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]
### we are continually in process, works in progress.

When beginning the collective, I described its focus as project-based learning. This has been refined to mean more process-oriented than task-oriented work. The group remains self-directed toward what its members want to make, and the process they take to make it, instead of requiring they absorb a pre-determined curriculum or complete particular objectives. Our conversations focus more on what you are learning along the way, how you are using the tools you found, how your technical choices are shaping your critical thinking, and how did your critical thinking is shaping your technical choices and tools, reciprocally and iteratively. 



This guide is a work in progress. The guide shows its rough edges before it is ready—a practice of vulnerability, an invitation for conversation. It is being drafted from scratch on a public website, built using Github, which includes a code repository and version tracking, so that every past version of the text is archived. Readers can compare differences in the history ([for example](https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commit/5e1ef814d661f43027e3d0f15b5ba87415194cfe?diff=unified)) line by line and comment on the text as it changes. This laid-bare writing process enacts the Code Collective value *Growth Not Perfection*, which is mostly a reminder for myself.

### we are continually expanding and questioning our definitions. more than one outcome is possible

*so many different outcomes for what you decide to do with a technical challenge you want to give to yourself. By spending time with others from different walks of life, we see how others approach the same problem vastly differently. Even with the exact same idea, one person might explore that with the goal to sell it commercially while another explores it by creating an expressive artwork. Along the way they are tackling the same troubleshooting problems, line by line, but perhaps answering the questions that arise very differently based on their goals. It helps to expand the spectrum of what one could make or invent, as a way to get out of our default modes and expectations for ourselves.*

### we build it together

Designing our online presence has been an ongoing collaboration, probably our only collaboration to date, although there have been talk of others. Through the (perhaps menial but important) work of creating a seemingly simple site, we declare our collective identity. We decide the tone of who we are as a group, how we will present to the outside what it is we are doing, what we prioritize, what we call ourselves, how we explain our processes, how we support others who join. 

The website expanded from a landing page into the more robust vision of a full-fledged Resource Hub, an interactive, fully contribute-able database to share the tools and tutorials we were discussing and why we found them useful. 



## 1.2. Growth not perfection
## 2. Scrappy strategies, not perfect code

We believe in scrappy [artistic] strategies not perfect code (#nocodesnobs[^p5]). [We believe in collaboration and community not competition, growth not perfection (#newKidLove[^p5]). 

### Duct tape and spitballs

[...] When it doesn't exist, we build it! We make it from other tools we scrap for parts. We break it to learn how it works, and why. 

>>When the tool doesn't exist we build it. We make it from the other tools we scrapped for parts. We break it to learn how it works, to see if it could work a different way, to see if its not working makes it sing out with poetry. We write it out on paper if we don't know how to say it with code. If we can't find an example, if we wonder why it doesn't exist, we know this means we might be the ones who should bring it to life. If it does exist, we also ask if it should. We reverse-engineer it, run it backwards. We learn from others' tutorials, combine them, and modify them, liberally.

I sometimes joke that my projects are a daisy chain of APIs[^api] held together with duct tape and spit. There is magic and politics and new knowledge to be found in creative applications and combinations of existing tools. To think about how to combine ingredients to produce new flavors, connect dots, (mix metaphors).  [...] 

The downside of this is of course when one link in the chain breaks, when a company gets bought by a bigger one and shuts down its open source access, or...

[^api]: APIs are the access points for the code you write to reach different services and tools online. API stands for Application Program Interface, and just as a web interface helps a human reach a website by giving it structure, an API tells your code what constraints it needs to reach that site programmatically. Like a menu, it tells the computer what and how to order up the information it needs. When coders use APIs, they're plugging into additional tools or pulling in data from the outside, for example Instagram or Mailchimp or the National Weather Service, on top of the code they have written themselves.


## 3. We get vulnerable. 

### Ask "stupid" questions (there are no stupid questions)

We voice our "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, deepest fears.

We meet folks where they are, no code snobs, no stupid questions. 

Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must do this. We connect over / remember that someone else has already worried the very same thing, or worse. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. I am continually finding that my presence in the classroom/facilitation space as a vulnerable uncertain artistic queer body who nevertheless creates does so much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have lectured. And the less I plan and structure ~~but instead gesture and invite~~, the more space I invite and permit for what needs and wants to arise. 



### we ~~embrace~~ highlight our mistakes

Sharing our struggles both helps us solve them by team troubleshooting *and* shows us and others that we are not alone with coding challenges. Being vulnerable makes us stronger and brings us closer. 

>"highlight mistakes just as much as successes, rather than hide them. it is important for people who are new to programming to see people making mistakes, if they think everything works first time they will think they are not good enough and give up." 
>>annatito, Critical Code Studies Working Group 2022@titoWeekP5Js2022

Highlighting mistakes is not about focusing on the negative; it brings us out of the shadows, out of the shame of feeling like we're the only ones who don't get it. Our mistakes connect us with vulnerability and with each other--and they help us solve our coding problems, because we're not the first to encounter this issue. 

Or sometimes we *are* the first to encounter this issue because we're trying to do something entirely new and important. It is helpful to get encouragement from friends either way. 

~~Many of the routes that got us here have been struggles. Learning to code is filled with false starts for so many people,~~
When we don't talk about learning struggles, it's easy to feel alone. This is true for all kinds of learning, including just learning to be in the world. There is no final state; there is ongoing learning. We need spaces that support all kinds of learning. 

### we feature progress / make mistakes in public / work iteratively

For example, I am writing this guide in a git repo (a type of archive used in programming to keep track of versions and allow multiple users to make edits). It is continually updated and saved on a public Github Pages website, which means both that you are reading a work in progress and also that anyone can see any prior version of it any time ([here](https://github.com/sarahciston/codingcare/commits/Jekyll/posts/guide.md)). 

<div class="play-along" markdown="1">

### PLAY ALONG: hello, old friend

Take a look at an old project, something you made more than six months ago and set aside. Maybe it's an unfinished piece you meant to get back to or an exercise that never got anywhere. That's okay. 

Read through the code with fresh eyes. Look at its syntax and its structure. How has your writing style changed? Is it more succinct? Do you understand how to solve problems differently now? Do you see things you would update or build upon now? 

And what's clever about it? What parts of it have you kept using in other projects? Are there any bits you might like to salvage for new ideas?

In a new file, try rewriting some of the code from scratch to see if you'd compose it differently today. Would you even use the same programming language? 

You could also try this exercise by trading a snippet of old code with a friend. Let them rewrite or continue it, exquisite corpse—style!

</div>

### we troubleshoot together

Live coding, though it might seem counterintuitive, sparks confidence. It helps to watch another coder, whether brilliant or beginner or both, struggle under the familiar burden of a problem and that feeling that they cannot solve it, and that they're unfit to call themselves real coders, that they're imposters, and that the feeling will never ever go away. Then collaborating with others to solve it. Remember them next time you feel the same way. You won't always feel that way. 

>"Just talking through your problems with somebody else always helps you get a better understanding what you're trying to do. But then also, other people will have different perspectives. Also just having that space to work through it together, having the time to sit down and be like, 'Okay, step one step two. Let me write these lines of code.' And then getting to different steps and going on the journey together. I feel like that's a really rewarding process that we go through." 
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

When we are together and witness each other struggle, that commonality reveals the lightness and the joy through community support. You're not going insane because you're not the only one who's gone insane staring at their code before. Yes, you do need sleep. Yes, you'll figure it out, or you'll figure something out. And we're here to help.

>"I loved editing that Three.js[^threejs] scene with Ada. I love being able to have group input. Before I was trying to communicate Three.js knowledge, and I've been struggling to get it out of my head. But, for some reason, seeing it in the group setting, it was a really fulfilling experience--like a teaching moment where I could communicate a lot of knowledge in a short amount of time."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

[^threejs]: Three.js is a code library (an add-on) in the Javascript language that helps create 3D graphics: [Three.js](https://threejs.org). For similar tools at a more introductory level, also check out the code library [P5.js](https://p5js.org), which is a great place to start learning widely applicable coding skills.
<!-- should i be linking technical tools to the CCC Resource Hub items instead? And can those be linked if they're dynamically generated? -->




### fight for the silly photo

...and I realized this was the entire spirit of the event in one image I glimpsed, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame. I am so grateful to Julia Kloiber from [Superrr Lab](https://superrr.net/about/) for asking to take a picture of the camera's preview screen and posting it on Instagram the day of the event, because that image would have been lost forever if they had not. I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for us to take a silly photo, or a photo in the first place—when the very spirit of the community is itself the entire point. I would not have been so nagged by that missing photo and its contrast to the stiff serious group photo that I spent several days tracking down the original memory card to locate the precious silly photo that so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of the day.

Anywhere you can get serious about silliness is a space to expand.

>"Pranking an AI—giving it a task and watching it fail—is a great way to learn about it"[^shane] (Shane 2019, 4).

### queer pirate mascots

The Code Collective approach is perhaps best illustrated by the sailing band of misfits in the TV show *Our Flag Means Death*, who support each other, sew flags together, explore identity together, figure out their career goals together, and fumble new skills while going on adventures.

## 4. We all have skills to teach each other. 

### We all already know a lot. We understand it differently. No one knows everything. 

Tell us something you know about! Tell us something you'd like to learn!

We look for the overlaps. Simple gestures like these begin to level hierarchies and connect people. Everyone has a perspective, and no one knows everything.

We don’t dismiss hierarchy out of hand, but acknowledge and work to address it by meeting each other where we are and valuing what each can contribute to another’s knowledge, and to better and more diverse computational systems.

### "always-already" / "end-user" programming

>>Bonnie Nardi says, "Computer-centric terms such as ‘novice’ obscure the possibilities for creating appropriate end user systems and are prejudicial in assigning prominence to the computer." @nardiSmallMatterProgramming1993

Ask ourselves: What do you want to make? What resources do you need to get there? /*More importantly, *why* do you want to put it in the world?*/ [xxxmovebelow?]

co-teach | co-learn | co-work | co-create

[always already programming](https://gist.github.com/melaniehoff/95ca90df7ca47761dc3d3d58fead22d4) —— "the programmer is also the user is also the programmer" 
>"When we all build up and cultivate one another’s agency to shape technology and online spaces, we are contributing to creating a world that is more supportive, affirming, and healing." "It's buttons all the way down." (Melanie Hoff)

### we know teaching others helps us learn // We learn together. ~~We wayfind together.~~ Collaboration, not competition. Growth, not perfection. "Care over careful"

>"There was beginner student who had trouble with code, and I think it was Katherine who helped but I forget. Being able to see the mentorship between between people. That was a really powerful thing for me to see. I remember seeing seeing that kind of like troubleshooting, debugging. That was really important for me to see."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab



## 5. We stay gelatinous [flexible, spongy, fluid, adjustable]

### Acknowledge situatedness and context together

And we acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals; our choices have histories, they come with politics attached.


We don’t assume we *should* code something just because we can. 

Through conversations about what we’re making and imagining, I try to model an artistic research practice that integrates the critical and creative, prioritizing dialectical exchange over prescriptive lecture, comfort with uncertainty and multiple approaches.

Very quickly the personal becomes political and our work easily extends beyond ourselves, to engage algorithmic bias and other issues in computation that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally. 

>>"Situated Computation is an approach to computational design that grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and political structures that shape it." 
>(Dr. Vernelle A. A. Noel)

>>"when communities are faced with new technological solutions to existing problems, to ask what these techniques may prevent and not only to check what the techniques promise to do." —Ursula M. Franklin @franklinRealWorldTechnology2004

Another way we think about context is to not dismiss ideas before they get off the ground. We stay excited by the impossibly large tasks and the incredibly small ones, knowing everything is connected. Knowing how 'way leads on to way', the tiny tangents always bring us back to the big issues, and the impossible pataphysical pursuits have a way of revealing practical applications when pursued.


### Address difference and power

Aligned in our interest in coding, we see our many differences as strengths and opportunities to learn from one another. We are committed to interdisciplinary, intersectional, iterative making. We make sure this is embedded in and extends beyond our own work, through our gatherings [...] [by including workshops and group research that focuses on algorithmic bias and other issues in computation that affect bodies in relationship to technology unequally.]

### Ask 'why' and 'how' not just 'what' to make


### Adjust for what's needed


### Value many forms [& tools]
[craft] [zines]
[cite][munisp5zine]

>"Writing elegant code requires all of the same components as crafting. There is absolutely skill, sophisticated technique, and technical knowledge required to be successful in the field. In both cases, we are using our hands and our brains to create something for others to enjoy. When thinking about code as a craft, we can look to the crafting community for ways to improve our industry." (Mercedes Bernard, @CrochetCodeCraft)

>"Newsletters were a kind of connective tissue that made readers aware of the larger information infrastructure lesbian feminists were building. [...] the network idea animated the newsletter’s communicative functions (35) [...] a lesbian-feminist mode of network t ing animates small-scale newsletters that draw on the language and practice of networking. These newsletters were published between the early 1970s and the mid 1990s," (36)(McKinney-Information Activism)


### Choose the right tool for the job

Sometimes we have to build it. Content is liquid; it will take the form of its container. It takes shape based on what the tools used can allow. Carefully choose tools and forms that share the values you want your work to embody. 

It takes shape within the limits of the affordances of one's tools. [rephrase] The capacities of the tools we choose set limits for our capacities to create. If I choose a saw, I may be able to build a birdhouse but won't be able to write an essay. 



## 6. We dream impossibly big *and* impressively tiny, too.

We're both excited for both impossibly large possibilities and also obsessed with tiny charming tasks. [xxxMore]

### Critical dreaming

Set aside your doubts and questions——what would you make if you could make anything, and why? 

It's true there's a lot to be said for the smallest viable prototype. Sure. But sometimes we can't help ourselves. We love to dream wildly. We'll figure out the impractical later and the impossible after that. Sometimes critical dreaming gets us where we need to go by overshooting so vastly we end up somewhere new. 

Scaling down can come later. Dream big!

*How do you practice critical dreaming? [xxx]*

#### Critical tinkering 

Choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away. 

These small things are seeds. We don't know what they might grow into but we trust they will grow: *"Everything small and buried surrenders to a process that none of the buried parts can see."*[^nepo] Sometimes they grow into the coolest things you'd never expect. Trust that they will (eventually) circle back and relate to the bigger things you are investigating. Follow that rabbit down the hole!

*How do you practice critical tinkering? [xxx]*


### we choose/find impossibly large things to get excited about too






## 7. We create rituals together

A combination of consistency and loose structure has served us best. 

We have adapted to the needs and circumstances of the community, continually. We strive for the loosest container possible to hold the thing together. 

Start with a round of check-ins: What are you making? What are you into right now? How are you doing, really?

Snacks and music and movement. Seriously, snacks are essential. 

Aim for consistency and flexibility through a steady mix of in-person meetings and online connection. 

These literally *make* the space we have together.

We are pretty free-form, but one of our structures has been open with a ritual of checking in on each other, asking what we are working on and thinking about. That short process often guides the rest of our weekly agenda because it’s space to take the temperature of the group, find out what code questions need investigating or troubleshooting, or for that matter what life questions too. 

Our other structures include a collaborative playlist that always kicks off with Queen (which was not my doing but I have fully embraced it as you can tell), as well as oodles of snacks to lure folks in. 

We also keep a weekly meeting cadence but this has gone from in-person to zoom to to back again, by way of various more fun video platforms, alongside an asynchronous Discord forums. 

The main takeaway is that we have adapted to the needs and circumstances of the community over the past three years, striving for the loosest container possible to hold the thing together. 

>SAMIR says: "It is more like a French salon where it's like, 'let's like hang out eat, and talk about code.' [...] but it's of consequence in these meetings. People do make huge strides in their projects, or solve crazy problems."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

The examples I offer here are often in flux as the temperaments and conditions of our members change. Fundamentally, we create ways of being together and acknowledging each others common humanity and unique perspectives simultaneously. We mark the specialness of contact and connection. Often this happens by accident and then codifies (code-ifies!) into a pattern we keep. Try and adjust until you find what works for you!

### Meet regularly

weekly if possible, in person if possible, and we accommodate what's not always possible. We're flexible to the impossible and know we'll get back to it later. Like old friends you can pick up with after an indeterminate amount of time, no questions asked. Or old code that needs a break from you after troubleshooting for too long. A frequent, consistent cadence of meeting in person is best. It feels easeful. And when we can't, there is trust we'll get back to each other when we can. Without pressure or resentment or guilt. It's not meant to be another obligation on the calendar, but a reprieve. We help restore each other through co-presence. We defrag each other's mental hard disks through the process of communing.  

Truth is, you don’t need to prepare much, just to start building community.

**core group, self selecting, figuring out what it is. problem-membership, not prostheletizing. word of mouth. public space, what are you doing, can i join? no cap, joseph beuys** humility, self conscious self deprecating, not warranted. 

This literally *makes* the room for each other, creates the room we have together [see we ask after each other #10]

### Show and tell / Take temperature with check ins

Or Round Robin, or Check Ins, or Council Method, or some version of an opening gesture for our gathering that acknowledges each person, gives them a short couple of minutes to share anything they want to share today. It could be how they are feeling, what they might be working on, a success or a struggle, something they've read or seen in the wild. By the time we've completed the circle we almost always have a clear trajectory for the rest of the day's meetup and are well into our first conversation or troubleshoot. We have also made room for each person, whether they are shy and would otherwise be steamrolled, or whether they would be first to speak and might otherwise share first each visit.   

### Support snacks at all costs

Seriously, everyone cites snacks as the number one item that keeps bringing students to our meetups. Snacks are magic. How do snacks do it? I don't know, ask snacks. Make sure you budget for snacks.

Every inquiry into what makes our community thrive was a broken record: SNACKS!

>"While this is a cliche food has always brought people together. Snacking together in the SCA basement brought out some of the best discussions and ideas I have entertained in college." 
>>—Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science

>"I think the snacks are definitely a big draw in the beginning. They would still be now, except for covid."
>>Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

>"I think I think food was a huge component. It brings people together, it puts people on the same level. Whenever people dine together, it it puts it it levels the playing field, and it kind of brings a sense of equality. That's important."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

Look for snacks that are computer keyboard friendly, nothing sticky, no tipsy liquids. A mix of salty and sweet is good, a mix of healthful and less-so, and single servings that avoid too much plastic wrapping are ideal: popcorn, pretzels, satsumas, gummy worms. If you have a Trader Joes in your area, we recommend the Sour Scandanavian Swimmers. 

As our meetings transitioned to virtual spaces and across timezones, snacks still held sway as a conversation starter. Then, on return to a campus strictly regulated with no-food policies and mask-wearing, our beloved snacks were off the table (under the table instead). Whether piled in the center of the table, dutifully taken outside, or discussed in their glaring absence, snacks represent the friendly core of the space and a reminder that we are not coding machines but fleshy bodies connected by our need to take breaks to digest and recharge. As we chew and chat, we digest and discuss what we're troubleshooting (both in code and life, it's all part of the processing).  
<!-- As de facto official of the collective, I can report that I never saw any students indulge in snacks during our meetings within view of a campus security camera. -->

### Share playlists

And it is on point! The Creative Code Collective theme song is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," which came to be when at our first meetup a quiet student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion for our background tunes. I was blown away. And it has been our rallying call ever since. 

A collaborative [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/sarahciston/playlist/2g6F9RM0Osbhw7ONwxSJhy?si=Cr0nEeExQiKPUQI-l7-HCA) on your open streaming platform of choice can not only offer some comfortable and energizing background noise while you work, it's another humanizing way to come together around something *other* than code. Anything that levels the field for participants and makes broader connections supports the community at large *and* when working on code. It's all connected! 

>"The terminal is cute. It's important to have a good relationship with your terminal." 
>>(Ada)

### we keep things loose

It has been one of my biggest stresses about our Collective learning how to lead. Because leadership feels like a responsibility I take seriously, but also a spotlight or a pedestal I'm wary of, this leadership feels like a tightrope walk in which I try nervously to make sure everyone is comfortable, having fun, and learning—all without forcing anything or having it "look like" anything is happening at all.

Of course, this does not work. That nervous strategy is riddled with stilted efforts of over-structured efforts leading to dead silence and loosey-goosey meandering conversations. Along the way I am continually learning the caring practices of facilitation as leadership, as being a vessel and a model. The space is a loose net—some structure is in fact necessary, though I was loathe to be the instigator of that structure at first. 

>Elea: "Can I go on a tangent?" 
>Sarah: "Always."

GIFs, TikToks, whatever's your thing... what brings a smile to your face and a sense of levity to the experience? What can you connect around? How can we not take ourselves so seriously even as we engage in the serious business of reimagining the world? 


<!-- #### (brave spaces w Sultan?) -->

<!-- Since Zoom Doom, we've been looking for ways to recreate the unique environment we'd built in person using (or building) other a/synchronous tools.  -->

## 9. We share [resources]

We share resources, honor emotional labor and the labor of documentation as essential parts of coding, and don't take for granted what feels intuitive or close to our hearts. 

### we foreground accessibility

Adapting our systems to our particular needs and those of others tends to make those systems more accessible for everyone. 

### minimal is accessible

Sometimes the low-fi answer is the right one. When searching for the right tools to build the Creative Code Collective Resource Hub, we went through every possible solution for a database, and landed on a google doc. When looking for ways to build the site for the Intersectional AI Toolkit, again we went through what seemed like endless possibilities for platforms, and landed back at simple JAM stack static sites, github pages, or wiki. Sometimes the less ambitious choices serve different purposes. They offer more access to other audiences. They leave the content and data more open and adaptable and legible to friends who might want to interact with it later, or to us as we build or rebuild it one day. We embrace minimal computing [cite] as an accessible and aesthetic and political value. 



### we choose open source, freely available, easily adaptable tools wherever possible


### we cite out of love

We cite and celebrate those who inspire what we do.

We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable, minimal tools that don't hide how they work.

We use what we make as an opportunity to share what we've learned along the way——archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, *zines*——thinking and making always happen in community. 

I looked to models like the Processing and P5js community that puts emphasis on access and connecting new coders with approachable information in multiple mediums. When starting the collective we went with a basic google team drive and a disorganized collection of links to tutorials and cool projects, some collaborative meeting notes, and called it a Hub.

Since then, the Resource Hub idea has expanded into its own group project. We spent many hours troubleshooting as a group to bring it to life, with Katherine Yang at the helm. It represents our group identity and our approach to sharing information and the way we work as well. In the hub and in our projects, we emphasize open-source and open-access tools. Anyone can contribute a resource that they’ve found useful, and can search by keywords from technical skills to critical concepts or random combinations thereof as a creative provocation. 

As students move on into the world, I’m working to document our values and  imagining how to expand outside the institution and welcoming members via Discord, starting new chapters at other universities and in other cities. And I’m starting to document our approaches slightly more formally as a zine and guidebook.

I’m not taking credit for any of these approaches being novel; in fact, in some ways, they are so instinctual they are easily dismissed—but they are too important to be overlooked, when they contribute so much to learning environments that support a variety of expression and creation. 

>KATHERINE says: “It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of, "Okay, [...] you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code.”


### let's keep track of what we already know, rather than duplicate our work

This started as a Google Doc where anyone could dump a link. It has grown into a full-fledged database, which we iterated on together during group troubleshooting sessions. Then rethought it again as a simple spreadsheet and form to feed the website. It has had many versions. Whether you make a wiki or cover the wall in sticky notes or use the latest sharing platforms all synched up to your phones, finding a free and open way to share information with one another—the lower the barrier the entry the better. There's always a tension between how structured or unstructured to make it (enough so people know where to put things and find things, not so much that they can't imagine new things that don't fit the existing form).


## We value documentation and care work. 
### documentation is hard work, necessary work, just as essential as the code itself

* collaborative notetaking in a shared etherpad or team doc
* starting a website together, posting your individual sketches or projects on a group github
* 

[CreativeCodeBerlin] [OSCA] [catalyst/vvvvaria/superrr/spideralex/so.america]





## 10. We encode our values

### Start with care 💜 before code

see Chapter 510's "care over careful" meaning care-ful with each other but not with worry about getting it "right" in a perfectionist sense. Perfectionism is white supremacy. [XXXcite] 

#### why care

>"Care is the practice of savouring how subtle differences can make all the difference."
>>[Data Loam.](http://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110697841/html) (2020). In J. Golding, M. Reinhart, & M. Paganelli (Eds.), De Gruyter. 

>"What happens when we integrate rather than refuse the pain, toil, and doom of surviving? How do we put our interconnectedness into practice?"
>>– Johanna Hedva

A practice for revolutions: *"Wherever you are standing, come one step closer."*[^@morehshin]

We are building community. We are encoding our values. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." We imagine how things could be otherwise. 

All making is a research question. What question do you want to explore? 



### Make room for each other
<!-- is this one in encode our values? -->

>"It's really reassuring to always come back to this environment of like, "Okay, you don't have to be that, you can go on your own journey at your own pace. And you can explore your own things and there's no one right way to code."**
>>-Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

#### Homebrew & sisterspit

### Ask after one another

>"We reassemble ourselves through the ordinary, everyday, and often painstaking work of looking after ourselves; looking after each other."
>>-Sarah Ahmed, *Living a Feminist Life*

We are excited to know each other and to care for one another as people, not as a means to an end. We learn from each other and our skills improve because of each other, but time and again we realize that is not the only—or even the main—reason we come together. 


I've learned that building communities through creative code, developing an ethics of coding care means to me a focus on …
* the scrappy: imperfect, iterative, vulnerable 
* the collaborative: co-teaching & co learning, embedded and situated, accounting for hierarchy, with and for community
* the embodied and entangled: meeting people where they are, with the material and experiences they have, merging theory and content with code and practice. choosing and sharing tools that are ethically and conceptually grounded

I have learned that **persistence is a rhythm, not a slog.** That **I can hold my pedagogy and my programming more loosely and they both become more pleasurable**. And **when I foreground care and connection the rest happens.**

For me, seeing students who thought they hated code return the next semester referring to themselves as coders—seeing them share projects that express a distinctive critical voice—affirms for me the importance of this kind of community and this combination of intersectional and interdisciplinary tactics for learning. And I’m starting to see the impacts it can have on their views of algorithmic systems and potential alternate futures.


>Since, as Kate Crawford argues, computational “ways of seeing depend on the twin moves of abstraction and extraction. But these logics can be challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected.” 

<!-- We're conscious of taking up space. -->

### we are still figuring out who we are

Experiences of becoming 'more ourselves' [...]

We gather as part of this effort, and we have started to trust each other with the care and feeding required to take on this continual work. We reveal ourselves, maybe slowly at first. By sharing the things we make or want to make, we share what we care about, who we care for, our politics. We get glimpses of each others homes and families and pets. We see each other chew with our mouths full or sweaty on arrival or frustrated to figure out a problem.  



### we are not in class. we're in community.

>"The idea of it has always been to create a space where you don't have to know everything. And it's not like class where you come and everyone's working towards one point, and how good you are is it is defined by how well you know the technology, how well you can do something. Because the club is inherently multidisciplinary, so people will have different strengths, a different background."
>>-Katherine Yang, she/her, BA Media Arts + Practice, Minor Linguistics, Minor Computer Science

We strike a balance that is neither the top-down hierarchy of a classroom nor the chaos of a "hierarchy-less" blob. We acknowledge the power dynamics at play and actively address them, working to help folks feel welcoming in community.

Our community is less about how it appears to outsiders than how it feels while inside it, except in the sense of inviting folks in. 

[...]

We fly under the radar. we are a rag-tag troupe of misfits, a dead poets' society, a secret laboratory, a not-so-secret guild.

Our mascots are magpies and meme cats, too-clever animals fascinated with hoarding shiny objects and causing a little trouble. We look to jellyfish and labyrinths for their translucent flexibility, their decentralized nervous systems, their twisty turny mystery and ability to go deep. 

Still we want to find openings for others to enter, [...]

>"I'd love to see this outside of the university setting. I wish this existed for urban professionals. I feel like not all of my Silicon Valley friends would partake in something like this, because they're so burnt out on code. But I'm sure there's a lot of people that are still wanting to have this conversation."
>>—Samir Ghosh, they/them, PhD student, UC Santa Cruz & former assistant director, USC Ahmanson Lab

[xxx][intro or conclusion or values]

What are the bricks, the building blocks, the core modules of a community like this one? What are the minimum foundations needed to support the space, to let people grow their craft their own way and flexibly flourish? 

Some items we have considered, or intuitively incorporated:

#### • Knowledge sharing repository/hub

#### • Steady cadence, ritual of gathering

#### • Material care & physical contact/resources

#### • Inclusive, iterative & recursive, inquisitive and embracing approaches

### why we're here, upon reflection (a former manifesto)

Care and compassion are infinite but neglected resources, literally life sustaining resources that renew themselves with use. 

[...]

~~We know that sneaky feeling an idea should already exist means we might be the ones who are meant to create it. We know that other sneaky feeling that an idea is too impossibly far-fetched, that we are the only ones who would want it, *still* means we are the ones who should pursue it. We are the ones who can bring our vision to life.~~

We break code to learn how it works, to see if it could work a different way, to see if its not working makes it sing out with poetry. We write it out on paper if we don't know how to say it with code. [htmlEnergy]

### how we do it 
### even when we don't know how
### why we do it anyway

When the tool we need doesn't exist, we build it. We make it from the existing tools we scraped for parts. We build it with duct tape and spit and the new programming language we teach ourselves along the way. 

We build it to prove to ourselves that it can exist. We build it as an offering for others to share. We build it to prove that building is for anyone, instruction manuals for hope. 

[...]

If it doesn't exist, we ask if it should. And if it does exist, we still ask if it should (or shouldn't). We ask how could it be otherwise. *All making is a research question.* All theory is theory–practice. All practice is theory–practice. Which is to say, our reading and thinking saturates what creative choices we make, what materials we use, how we speak about what we do. This is true even if unconscious. And so we choose to acknowledge this and do so mindfully. || Our creative choices and materials and our work in our bodies saturates our reading and thinking, our vocabularies, our points of reference, our critical tools, our communities of practice. These are recursive and reciprocal and iterative. Making is always a research question about how to live.
[[insert figure]]   

When we can't find a tutorial, we don't assume it can't be done. We don't assume it isn't meant to be done. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." Instead we try asking with new language, asking a friend with a different background, asking with our hands in the dirt, asking as we tinkering on another project in another medium, until answers circle back to us. We write it out on paper, we draw it, we sing it, we take a dance break. *Persistence is a rhythm not a slog.*

We reverse-engineer, run it backwards, learn from others' examples and apply, combine, modify them liberally. We pull from anywhere, [interdisciplinary, intersectional practice.]

[...]

We make coded things in order to connect with others, to bridge the ephemeral spark gaps of language and feeling and being separate creatures trying to reach each other. We make things hoping someone thinks they're kind of cool. 

We write code in order to decode the systems that ... [encumber us]

*We refuse to be outsiders in the systems that injure us or ignore us.* We reject notions of intimidation or gatekeeping that deny creativity, joy, politics, and purposes that reach beyond perpetuating white-supremacist capitalist status quo. 

When we say we, we write for the parts of ourselves that have been neglected or ignored, a habit we learned too early, a trick imposed upon us and repeated. ~~When we say we, we claim this audaciously and unapologetically, and hope you feel it too, but you don't have to.~~










<!-- [How to Fork a Book](https://markcmarino.medium.com/how-to-fork-a-book-the-radical-transformation-of-publishing-3e1f4a39a66c) by Sarah Ciston and Mark C. Marino , we talk about a "yes, and" ethos and add "Code Confessions" and "Code Commentaries." "Code Confessions reflect on our experiences starting to learn to program, while Code Commentaries do critical close-readings of source code, an approach that comes from the Critical Code Studies discipline. Code Confessions are opportunities to further humanize the process of writing code by talking about our embodied, emotional encounters with the process of programming: How it felt to work on this code or to encounter the same issues readers might during their practice. Meanwhile, Code Commentaries are opportunities to pursue the methods of Critical Code Studies by interpreting the meaning of the code on the page, line by line."   "we model how we as programmers feel about our own code. Extending the concept of comments in code, we take the opportunity to discuss the affective relationship to the journey that is programming, admitting to mistakes and acknowledging fears. These sections personalize the approach and dismantle the authoritarian hierarchy or boundary between knowledge “holder” and knowledge “seeker.” This aspect was essential to emphasize the ways we learn in community, revealing that the teacher programmer didn’t always know what they’re doing and may still find their way with a beginner’s mindset. The code confessions sections are expressions of humility in an effort to further welcome the newcomer. They stand opposed to encoded chauvinism, or the toxic brogrammer culture that can be so off-putting to new programmers, especially those who come from outside the dominant culture."-->

>"I remember I was presenting this project. I'd done at my internship where it was a Processing project. And it featured this ink simulation. And then I remember people were asking me how I did it.

>"It's small and tight, and we have a bunch of regulars. but I also feel like maybe there are other people out there who were not reaching who might be interested or where we can like the community, would benefit from having them as well, we're even like not just individuals. like other organizations like, I think, the a student assembly for accessibility with having some discussions about technological accessibility."

>"Most of all, the practice and reward from creative coding showed me first-hand that I shouldn’t be scared of new territory. It might seem simple, but the work I was able to achieve did more than shake my fear of code; it gave me a natural curiosity on the future of social media, the hands behind updated features, and how a new generation of thinkers and media-movers could reshape our understanding of it."

>"AI systems are built with the logics of capital, policing, and militarization—and this combination further widens the existing asymmetries of power.

But these logics can be challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected."

>>Ada: stumbled on it by chance, i get bored very easily, won't take projects unless i'm very excited about it. kind of trained me, started learning more music visualization and how i built up all the ..al the coding knowledge i have is 

SC: learning to give your self permission even though there isn't a clear path. 

>>Ada: improving from learning how to better look things up. read the documentation before, to know where to look when you ended something. making the referencing process faster. making reference sheets. straight copy, give credit, connect something new/make a change

<!-- # **The Coding Care Zine**

[Original Zine Draft](assets/img/CodingCareZine.pdf)

>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways." 
>>–adrienne maree brown

*Coding Care* 

## we come from anywhere

We don't always fit in. Artists, activists, first-gen students, never-ever coders, CS majors, never-ever-coders, writers, dancers. linguists, neuroscientists, trans kids, queer folks, staff and teachers, we all find different ways into code and community.

## we are always works in progress

Many of the routes that got us here have been struggles. Learning to code is filled with false starts for so many people, and when we don't talk about it, it's easy to feel alone. So is learning to be in the world. There is no final state; there is ongoing learning. We need spaces that support all kinds of learning. 

## we create who we are together

What does this particular cluster of beings need and desire from this gathering? What do we stand for? We define it and redefine it for ourselves. 

## we find our way together

Scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code. Growth not perfection. Collaboration not competition. 

When it doesn't exist, we build it! We make it from other tools we scrap for parts. We break it to learn how it works, and why. 

We meet folks where they are, no code snobs, no stupid questions. 

## we ~~embrace~~ highlight our mistakes

Sharing our struggles both helps us solve them by team troubleshooting *and* shows us and others that we are not alone with coding challenges. Being vulnerable makes us stronger and brings us closer. 

## we all have skills to teach each other

Tell us something you know about! Tell us something you'd like to learn!

co-teach | co-learn | co-work | co-create

Everyone has a perspective, and no one knows everything.

## we're excited for the impossibly large possibilities, and the tiny charming tasks, too

Set aside your doubts and questions——what would you make if you could make anything, and why? Scaling down can come later. Dream big!

Small seeds of ideas you can start right away can grow into the coolest things. Follow that rabbit down the hole!

## we ask WHY, WHO, HOW, not only WHAT to make

And we acknowledge many contexts that situate the tools and languages we choose. There are no defaults, no neutrals; our choices have histories, they come with politics attached.

## we make room for each other

We're conscious of taking up space.

## we ask after one another

## we make our own rituals

Start with a round of check-ins: What are you making? What are you into right now? How are you doing, really?

Snacks and music and movement. Seriously, snacks are essential. 

Aim for consistency and flexibility through a steady mix of in-person meetings and online connection. 

These literally *make* the space we have together.

## we think open source

We share resources, honor emotional labor and the labor of documentation as essential parts of coding, and don't take for granted what feels intuitive or close to our hearts. 

We cite and celebrate those who inspire what we do.

We highlight shareable, accessible, adaptable, minimal tools that don't hide how they work.

We use what we make as an opportunity to share what we've learned along the way——archives, resource hubs, salons, works in progress, *zines*——thinking and making always happen in community. 

## we start with care 💜

We are building community. We are encoding values. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." We imagine how things could be otherwise. 

All making is a research question. What question do you want to explore?
