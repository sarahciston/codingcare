# Stuff We're Learning Along the Way / Strategies

## we [remember/learn] code isn't magic, but we are
Code is language, code is a tool; code can be read and learned and used to express. 

## we choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away

## we choose/find impossibly large things to get excited about too

## we make room for each other

### we voice our "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, deepest fears
Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must do this. We connect over / remember that someone else has already worried the very same thing, or worse. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. I am continually finding that my presence in the classroom/facilitation space as a vulnerable uncertain artistic queer body who nevertheless creates does so much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have lectured. And the less I plan and structure ~~but instead gesture and invite~~, the more space I invite and permit for what needs and wants to arise. 

### (brave spaces, sultan?)

## we are serious about silliness

### we live for snacks
Seriously, snacks get cited as the number one item that keep bringing students to our meetups. Snacks are magic. How do snacks do it?

### we start each session with a shared playlist
And it is on point! The Creative Code Collective theme song is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," which came to be when at our first meetup a quiet student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion for our background tunes. I was blown away. And it has been our rallying call ever since. 

A collaborative playlist on your open streaming platform of choice can not only offer some comfortable and energizing background noise while you work, it's another humanizing way to come together around something *other* than code. Anything that levels the field for participants and makes broader connections supports the community at large *and* when working on code. It's all connected! 

### we fight for the silly photo
...and I realized this was the entire spirit of the event in one image I glimpsed, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame. I am so grateful to Julia Kloiber from [Superrr Lab](https://superrr.net/about/) for asking to take a picture of the camera's preview screen and posting it on Instagram the day of the event, because that image would have been lost forever if they had not. I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for us to take a silly photo, or a photo in the first place—when the very spirit of the community is itself the entire point. I would not have been so nagged by that missing photo and its contrast to the stiff serious group photo that I spent several days tracking down the original memory card to locate the precious silly photo that so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of the day.

## Principles & Protocols

These principles began as intuition and expanded, distilled, developed along the way as we noted parallels with other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more. 

### scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]

### growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]

### collaboration, not competition[^ccc]

### we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 

### meet people where they are. don't assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]

### value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]

### all theory and practice is theory–practice.[^ccc] interdisciplinary goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality[^ccc]

### #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #indigenouslivesmatter we engage tension; don't indulge drama[^amb] 

### focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]

### listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council]

### assume best intent and attend to impact[^amb]

### attempt collaboration before conflict[^superrr]

### we accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong[^p5] 

### we take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality)[^amb]

### we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

These guidelines are open to inputs and updates as necessary to support the needs of this space and community as they evolve.
