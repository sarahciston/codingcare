## Strategies & Learning Along the Way

## we [remember/learn] code isn't magic

## we choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away

## we choose/find impossibly large things to get excited about too

## we voice our "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, deepest fears
Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must do this. We connect over / remember that someone else has already worried the very same thing, or worse. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. I am continually finding that my presence in the classroom/facilitation space as a vulnerable uncertain artistic queer body who nevertheless creates does so much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have lectured. And the less I plan and structure ~~but instead gesture and invite~~, the more space I invite and permit for what needs and wants to arise. 

## we fight for the silly photo
...and I realized this was the entire spirit of the event in one image I glimpsed, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame. I am so grateful to Julia XXXXX from Superrrr for asking to take a picture of the camera, because that image would have been lost forever if they had not. And I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for us to take a silly photo, or a photo in the first place—when the very spirit of the community is itself the entire point. 

## Principles & Protocols

These principles began as intuition and expanded, distilled, developed along the way as we noted parallels with other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more. 

### scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]

### growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]

### collaboration, not competition[^ccc]

### we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 

### meet people where they are. don't assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]

### value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]

### all theory and practice is theory–practice.[^ccc] interdisciplinary goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality[^ccc]

### #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #indigenouslivesmatter we engage tension; don't indulge drama[^amb] 

### focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]

### listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council]

### assume best intent and attend to impact[^amb]

### attempt collaboration before conflict[^superrr]

### we accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong[^p5] 

### we take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality)[^amb]

### we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

These guidelines are open to inputs and updates as necessary to support the needs of this space and community as they evolve.
