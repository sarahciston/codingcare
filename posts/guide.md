<!-- # Learning Along the Way -->

## 1. we know code isn't magic, but we are
Code is language, code is a tool; code can be read and learned and used to express. 

>"No way, code is magic." 
>(Samir, they/them, Assistant Director USC Ahmanson Lab)

### we choose/find small things to get excited about and do them right away

### we choose/find impossibly large things to get excited about too

It's true there's a lot to be said for the smallest viable prototype. Sure. But sometimes we can't help ourselves. We love to dream wildly. We'll figure out the impractical later and the impossible after that. Sometimes overshooting gets us where we need to go by overshooting and scaling down a bit later.

## 2. we make room for each other

### ...and we ask after each other

### we meet regularly

weekly if possible, in person if possible, and we accommodate what's not always possible. We're flexible to the impossible and know we'll get back to it later. Like old friends you can pick up with after an indeterminate amount of time, no questions asked. Or old code that needs a break from you after troubleshooting for too long. A frequent, consistent cadence of meeting in person is best. It feels easeful. And when we can't, there is trust we'll get back to each other when we can. Without pressure or resentment or guilt. It's not meant to be another obligation on the calendar, but a reprieve. We help restore each other through co-presence. We defrag each other's mental hard disks through the process of communing.  

<!-- #### (brave spaces w Sultan?) -->

### this literally *makes* the room for each other, creates the room we have together

### we support snacks
Seriously, everyone cites snacks as the number one item that keeps bringing students to our meetups. Snacks are magic. How do snacks do it? I don't know, ask snacks. Make sure you budget for snacks.

>>"While this is a cliche food has always brought people together. Snacking together in the SCA basement brought out some of the best discussions and ideas I have entertained in college." 
>(Ada Toydemir, they/them, MS Computer Science)

As our meetings transitioned to virtual spaces and across timezones, snacks still held sway as a conversation starter. Then, on return to a campus strictly regulated with no-food policies and mask-wearing, our beloved snacks were off the table (under the table instead). Whether piled in the center of the table, dutifully taken outside or discussed in their absence, snacks  
<!-- As de facto official of the collective, I can report that I never saw any students indulge in snacks during our meetings within view of a campus security camera. -->

### we start sessions with a shared playlist
And it is on point! The Creative Code Collective theme song is Queen's "Don't Stop Me Now," which came to be when at our first meetup a quiet student piped up out of the blue with this amazing suggestion for our background tunes. I was blown away. And it has been our rallying call ever since. 

A collaborative playlist on your open streaming platform of choice can not only offer some comfortable and energizing background noise while you work, it's another humanizing way to come together around something *other* than code. Anything that levels the field for participants and makes broader connections supports the community at large *and* when working on code. It's all connected! 

### we start each session with show and tell

Or Round Robin, or Check Ins, or Council Method, or some version of an opening gesture for our gathering that acknowledges each person, gives them a short couple of minutes to share anything they want to share today. It could be how they are feeling, what they might be working on, a success or a struggle, something they've read or seen in the wild. By the time we've completed the circle we almost always have a clear trajectory for the rest of the day's meetup and are well into our first conversation or troubleshoot. We have also made room for each person, whether they are shy and would otherwise be steamrolled, or whether they would be first to speak and might otherwise share first each visit.   

## 3. we make mistakes 

### we are serious about silliness

>"Pranking an AI—giving it a task and watching it fail—is a great way to learn about it" (Shane 2019, 4).
### we fight for the silly photo
...and I realized this was the entire spirit of the event in one image I glimpsed, through a screenshot of a thumbnail of a frame of a frame. I am so grateful to Julia Kloiber from [Superrr Lab](https://superrr.net/about/) for asking to take a picture of the camera's preview screen and posting it on Instagram the day of the event, because that image would have been lost forever if they had not. I would not have known what was missing, or why I'd had the instinct to ask for us to take a silly photo, or a photo in the first place—when the very spirit of the community is itself the entire point. I would not have been so nagged by that missing photo and its contrast to the stiff serious group photo that I spent several days tracking down the original memory card to locate the precious silly photo that so much better represented us and the enthusiasm of the day.

### we voice our "stupid" questions, nagging suspicions, deepest fears
Even, and especially, as leaders and teachers we must do this. We connect over / remember that someone else has already worried the very same thing, or worse. Our bravery makes space for others to be brave. I am continually finding that my presence in the classroom/facilitation space as a vulnerable uncertain artistic queer body who nevertheless creates does so much more to teach and model how to create than anything I actually have lectured. And the less I plan and structure ~~but instead gesture and invite~~, the more space I invite and permit for what needs and wants to arise. 

### we put everything in context 

>>"Situated Computation is an approach to computational design that grounds technologies in the social world by acknowledging the historical, cultural, and material contexts of designing and making. It acknowledges and responds to a setting’s social and technological infrastructures, and refuses to remain ignorant of economic and political structures that shape it." 
>(Dr. A. A. Vernelle Noel, Georgia Tech)

### When making we ask Why. And How and Who. Not just What.

### we are not in class. we're in community.

We strike a balance that is neither the top-down hierarchy of a classroom nor the chaos of a "hierarchy-less" blob. We acknowledge the power dynamics at play and actively address them, working to help folks feel welcoming in community.

Our community is less about how it appears to outsiders than how it feels while inside it, except in the sense of inviting folks in. 

We fly under the radar. we are a rag-tag troupe of misfits, a dead poets' society, a laboratory, a not-so-secret guild.

Our mascots are magpies and meme cats, too-clever animals fascinated with hoarding shiny objects and causing a little trouble. We look to jellyfish and labyrinths for their translucent flexibility, their decentralized nervous systems, their twisty turny mystery and ability to go deep. 

Still we want to find openings for others to enter, [...]

## 4. we share resources 

### let's keep track of what we already know, rather than duplicate our work

This started as a Google Doc where anyone could dump a link. It has grown into a fullfledged database, which we iterated on together during group troubleshooting sessions. Then rethought it again as a simple spreadsheet and form to feed the website. It has had many versions. Whether you make a wiki or cover the wall in sticky notes or use the latest sharing platforms all synched up to your phones, finding a free and open way to share information with one another—the lower the barrier the entry the better. There's always a tension between how structured or unstructured to make it (enough so people know where to put things and find things, not so much that they can't imagine new things that don't fit the existing form).

### minimal is accessible

Sometimes the low-fi answer is the right one. When searching for the right tools to build the Creative Code Collective Resource Hub, we went through every possible solution for a database, and landed on a google doc. When looking for ways to build the site for the Intersectional AI Toolkit, again we went through what seemed like endless possibilities for platforms, and landed back at simple JAM stack static sites, github pages, or wiki. Sometimes the less ambitious choices serve different purposes. They offer more access to other audiences. They leave the content and data more open and adaptable and legible to friends who might want to interact with it later, or to us as we build or rebuild it one day. We embrace minimal computing [cite] as an accessible and aesthetic and political value. 

### documentation is hard work, necessary work, just as essential as the code itself


[...]

## 5. we foreground our values

What are the bricks, the building blocks, the core modules of a community like this one? What are the minimum foundations needed to support the space, to let people grow their craft their own way and flexibly flourish? 

Some items we have considered, or intuitively incorporated:

#### • Knowledge sharing repository/hub

#### • Steady cadence, ritual of gathering

#### • Material care & physical contact/resources

#### • Inclusive, iterative & recursive, inquisitive and embracing approaches


[...]

These principles began as intuition and expanded, distilled, developed along the way as we noted parallels with other organizations, thinkers, makers, and more. 

>>"Any meeting or gathering is a place to practice the future together in the most tangible ways" (Brown 2021, 117)

### scrappy artistic strategies, not perfect code[^ccc] #nocodesnobs[^p5]

>>When the tool doesn't exist we build it. We make it from the other tools we scraped for parts. We break it to learn how it works, to see if it could work a different way, to see if its not working makes it sing out with poetry. We write it out on paper if we don't know how to say it with code. If we can't find an example, if we wonder why it doesn't exist, we know this means we might be the ones who should bring it to life. If it does exist, we also ask if it should. We reverse-engineer it, run it backwards. We learn from others' tutorials, combine them, and modify them, liberally.

I sometimes joke that my projects are a garland of APIs held together with duct tape. There is magic and politics and new knowledge to be found in creative applications and combinations of existing tools. To think about how to combine ingredients to produce new flavors, connect dots, (mix metaphors). 

### growth, not perfection[^ccc] #newKidLove[^p5]

### collaboration, not competition[^ccc]

### we all have skills to teach each other[^ccc] 

### meet people where they are. don't assume knowledge or imply hierarchies of skills. we are not snobs about coding, scholarship, or other forms of knowledge.[^p5]

>>"have things as major steps then under each major step is all the sub steps and any gotcha’s or possible errors" (annatito, CCSWG22)
>>"highlight mistakes just as much as successes rather than hide them it is important for people who are new to programming to see people making mistakes, if they think everything works first time they will think they are not good enough and give up." (annatito, CCSWG22)

### value processes as much as, or more than, outcomes[^amb]

### all theory and practice is theory–practice.[^ccc] interdisciplinary goes hand-in-hand with intersectionality[^ccc]

### #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #indigenouslivesmatter we engage tension; don't indulge drama[^amb] 

### focus on strategies rather than issues, solutions rather than problems[^AMC]

### listen from the heart, speak from the heart, be spontaneous, be brief[^Council]

### assume best intent and attend to impact[^amb]

### attempt collaboration before conflict[^superrr]

### we accept responsibility for our actions and take care to make amends when we are wrong[^p5] 

### we take the lessons, leave the details (confidentiality)[^amb]

### we center care[^AMC]—self care and community care[^amb] 

We are excited to know each other and to care for one another as people, not as a means to an end. We learn from each other and our skills improve because of each other, but time and again we realize that is not the only—or even the main—reason we come together. 

These guidelines are open to inputs and updates as necessary to support the needs of this space and community as they evolve.
