I am still alive, On Kawara. I find your dailiness remarkable. It takes so much: To get up at any time in the morning. To make a painting. To make a life. To make a day. Day after day. You fit this feeling in a postcard, with a view. You just report. 

<!-- A simple act of reporting. Distributing data, is always personal.  -->

What I like about you is you don't offer any context. Just 'I got up'. Just 'I am still alive'. What more do you want from me, you seem to say. 

You wrote to Sol Lewitt, to XXXXX and XXXXX. [I hope I can/I'll] write to you. I am also still alive. [(Although (now) you're not.)] It doesn't feel remarkable, but it is, and I mark it, remark it. Some people I know are also alive but don't want to be. It's hard to know how to live, especially right now. And it always has been hard to know how to live. It always has been 'especially right now'. But each of us makes our problems our own. We evade oneness through simple acts like 'I'. We do it on the reg. 

Data accumulates days.

You chose a a few basic rituals and stuck with them. All you needed to say was, "I am still alive." Sometimes the only affirmation a person can hold is, "I am still alive." Sometimes it is all we can stand. Sometimes we can't even stand that. Sometimes that is enough. Sometimes even that is too much.

I got up at 9:50am. I woke up several times before that. You also have a postcard series about this, and the times range wildly. This makes me like you more, I'll be honest. I resent some forms of dedication that [some] claim are required of me if I want to [XXXI don't know what][like if I really wanted to XYZ I would get up at 4am every day and write for 4 hours before starting my day as if this is the formula for everyone, as if we share the same capacities.]

A few years ago I also made an artwork that tracked all my daily habits. I felt young and girlish when I made art with my data. (Would I have felt that way if it was someone else's data, someone seemingly less young ang girlish themselves?) I got comments like, "You sure do sleep a lot. Are you depressed?" I think I slept about the same as you, On Kawara. I'm sure we were both read into. And that was the point, but I still didn't like the feeling. Your context was the daily paper, a postcard of a skyscraper, a telegram. My context was shared ipad screens, reading critical media theory, a looming breakup. [Although who knows what might have been going on between you and your correspondees.]  

I also planned to make an app to collect as many streams of the data I was producing as possible. And I wanted to call it the simplest name possible: "I'm still alive" Because to over-know the body through data was eventually to say nothing. To turn being into producing, to over-write meaning, work-over, overthink, but also to palimpsest, erase, rewrite it with read-outs, replace proprioception and interoception with data outputs and analyses. It offered the illusion that I would gain insight by offering up the non-labor I was doing anyway, but by tracking it, extracting it, and selling it, made it have value and thus made it labor. Because then I attend to these devices, I spend money and time on them. Every day I check my heartbeat, I write or rather inscribe in data 'I got up at' or become vulnerable to a system who will know this about me, a google map which might implicate me in a future crime I have yet to imagine. The weight of this where before nothing existed.  


<!-- [XXX These read differently if you know us (and if you don't). We are each read into differently (as many other important scholars have said).] -->

<!-- I am yearning for this repetition; I find it in loops of fiber. -->

<!-- I want to fill a room with e-ink screens and  -->

Later I made artworks that asked people to bring their data with them. I asked for compassion, in small portable phrases — ones that could be turned from sound into writing into data packets into sound again. Some people seemed upset I was asking, said I was being too polite. This felt a lot about gender, although less and less do I want to have one. 

I got a tattoo on my arm written in calculator font that says "IT'S OKAY TO CRY," after the song by SOPHIE — musician/producer, and trans rights activist Sophie Xeon. My tattoo artist [Ren] created a series of flash pieces honoring her life and work, after SOPHIE died in 2021 when she slipped and fell while climbing up to look at the moon. 

I need the phrase written on my body so that one day I will start to believe it. 

The affirmation "IT'S OKAY TO CRY" had already appeared in the database of compassionate phrases I built. I have been continually surprised by the database, both that others do contribute and also that it remains effective at soothing me, even as I know its gimmicks. 

*It's okay to cry.*
*You'll figure it out eventually.*
*What you choose is up to you.*

Recently they added a Boolean operator to Javascript called Nullish, written `??`. My feelings exactly. Nullish is meant for "when there are multiple ways something can not exist" (evelyn masso "Handling Null"). Nullish distinguishes `null` and `undefined` from other `False` and `NaN`, although all of these are 'Falsy'. Nullish hovers liminially in the never was or maybe erased. Use plain ol' `null` "when something can optionally exist." Oh to be a Nullable coalescing, there or/and nothing (masso, Sedgwick).

There are researchers at work using machine learning analysis to detect suicidality, particularly in children or veterans, which on the surface seems a humanitarian good but upon closer inspection is rife with *Minority Report*–esque predictive-policing problematics. Looking for patterns, you will find patterns, but what will you do with them? How far will you go in limiting someone's life to prevent their death? Analyses found a wide range of correlations: 

>"people experiencing suicidal thoughts sighed more and laughed less than others. When speaking, they tended to pause longer and to shorten their vowels, making words less intelligible; their voices sounded breathier, and they expressed more anger and less hope." [@khullarCanTreatMental2023] "having arthritis, lupus, or head-and-neck cancer; taking statins or Ambien; or living in the Western U.S. can also add to a veteran’s risk" "It’s also possible that preventing deaths takes time—that frequent touchpoints, over years, are what drive suicide rates down across a population."
>"needed a proxy for" "The algorithm’s designers needed a proxy for illness and settled on medical costs. (All things being equal, people who are sicker tend to use more health care.) Obermeyer found, however, that the algorithm dramatically underestimated how sick Black patients were, because the Black patients it examined had much lower health spending than the white patients, even when they were equally sick. Such algorithmic bias can occur not just by race, but by gender, age, rurality, income, and other factors of which we’re only dimly aware, making algorithms less accurate." 
>"Studies have shown that text-based therapy can work well. It also generates data."
>"I could have searched for the words to describe my feelings to my phone. I might have expressed them while sharing them with no one—unless you count the machines."

Writing to no one, a postcard out into the world (Derrida) vs an "entity" that senses your increased biometric feedback and responds to you. This desire for attunement. In the past we got it from women, trained to be wives and mothers and ignore their own readings. We look for it now in machines because we don't have enough hands on deck to provide care (because we are not willing to provide it mutually?). We have NLP reading suicide notes and doing predictive modeling for future anxious children. All well and good seeming activities, all also very minority report in its sci-fi possibility space.

who decides these things, the poetics of code standards societies


What does it mean to remind you (or me) that I am still alive? For audre lorde this is an act of revolution just even to live in spite of powerful forces that strive to extinguish you. Many of us [others] live on the backs of other people. Others love as [acts of devotion/devotional acts].

The smooth silence of drone footage over destruction. The glide above bombs and voice over. 

Someone reminds me it is not my responsibility to keep other people alive, no matter how much I care for them. But then, whose job is it? We all keep each other alive. And lately we are failing at this work, failing with dramatic speed. Unaliving at accelerating pace. 

Unalive is the rewriting of unspeakable death to avoid censorship by platforms. Platforms do not read between the lines. They are not reading for context clues. They cannot distinguish between deaths to discuss and deaths to erase. They cannot distinguish between queer sexuality and pornography. Although they claim to distinguish between a male nipple and a female nipple, even though gender is not real. And so we must spell out new stuttering formulations like `s3x` and `~~death~~` and `les-bean` or `les🐝an`, which fool these sophisticated systems. 

This is about knots instead of threads. This is about staying in bed. Do I have covid again? Having covid and long covid at the same time is weird. Is this the only time I write essays? I watched the Hitchcock film *Rope* last time I had covid. This time I talk with my mother about smart ways to get away with [death/euthanasia and to prevent suicide], if the occasion called for it. We may talk more than the average family about [murder and other] kinds of death. Justifiable homicide. Euthanasia. 



making and breaking, the queer use of lying in bed / unable to dissertate in a pandemic, creating/learning a web home versus completing the projects i said i would make when i came in, how every part/skill is connected, can be stitched together and reconnected and collaborated with to make the text thing
the parts of myself collaborate with each other, reacquainted as if strangers

something that tracks the time, pace/cadence, smell of every word, my heartbeat and breath pattern, the over collection of its data and the pond it sits in, the energy sinkhole…(connect sink holes to the cave state, the show me state, the trau$$ma state) what is this duct taped story object, touching object, screen i am making, a way to reach through the plexiglass to each other, 
the computer is a classifying machine, if code is built on binary and the zeros and ones are made to say either or, not [either and] … [both maybe] a voltage rush, a spark gap… what is the computational system built on the surges and loss, the wavering? the felt feeling? you’ll argue this is getting metaphorical not close to the metal (a metaphor) what could be closer to the metal than bone, that wrended flesh? 

queer use as vandalism & broken machines 
>“to transform a system we have to stop a system from working” (Ahmed)
>“there are queer possibilities not only in use, how materials can be picked up when we refuse an instruction, but in not being of use.” (Ahmed)

**a classification/categorization system that instead points on a spectrum rather than putting a boundary around the category, a multi-dimensional spectrum?**

### who decides these things, the poetics of code standards societies
There is a new operator in ECMAScript 11 called Nullish, named appropriately and represented by my feelings exactly: ?? and it distinguishes undefined and null from false and not-a-number. Nullish, partially erased, hovering liminally. 
avoid null "when there are multiple ways something can not exist"; use null "when something can optionally exist" (masso)


And with ES9, ... the ellipses copies or clones objects. Whereas Winnie Soon discussed the throbber, and we have the rainbow beachball of doom, and the three dots of death, awaiting arrival of a message being written, or revised, or deleted, one never knows. Here an abundance. A Dolly the Sheep Dot Dot Dot. 


return to the anxiety of too many too much asked of me, no one asked, i asked this of myself, all the things i am excited for, imagine making and doing and joining
code palimpsests from Annette Vee, looking at Bakhtin's speech genres, each utterance a refraction of prior.



all platforms are the same and yet there are so many  
all platforms are products  
a platform is a container, i write i write i write to put something inside, to fill up to churn churn churn to produce until the platform is full until commerce is satisfied. if i could churn myself into a platform then i would know i had really made something, something i could sell.

platform like diving like train - these are all places from which to jump off
the promise is to launch, or the promise is to fall. 
the promise is to transform

i want the perfect place to write that makes the words come out (right) makes them saleable, understood, makes them change something for good, makes the platform i need for them rise up out of the underbrush, out of the many imperfect platforms i have tried. 
we cobble together collaborations from "i'll meet you on zoom and slack and this google doc; i'll have all of them open at once on this 13-inch screen, on this 6-inch mobile screen, on this vr elastic screen, on this invasive dream where i am at work still even in sleep." MOBILE FIRST! the bleakness of platforms is dreamlike, designed to disappear into the way we hold a tool without thinking when it just works, ignoring how it forms the landscape for us (Craeft, Ingold, Hiedegger).

<!-- Elsewhere I have written "an app could include everything I've been researching? strawflower/i'm still alive? what would i do with it as a performance?"

>"they often have a first person, it isn’t my first person—and furthermore, it’s a first person at the very edge of its decomposition." [@sedgwickWeatherProust2012] "the fractal dimension of compassion is that of not self, not other, not both self and other, and not neither self nor other."

I am back to the dream where I am inventing new code languages in my sleep. Once I dreamt just two sentences, and they were these: 

>"I dreamt I was mapping points of non-correspondence."

>"I dreamt I became and no one believed me."

Except actually the way I dreamt the sentence, but was afraid to write it down:

>"I dreamt I came out and no one believed me."

![violates policy](../_site/assets/img/violatepolicy.png)

I want a machine un/learning that maps points of non-correspondence, de-limiting the ways we might relate to one another. I want a dyke for president, and I want a chat bot that can imagine it and tell me about it without it "violating its content policy," or even a chatbot that can tell me about the very real artwork by Zoe Leonard called "I want a dyke for president" based on the dyke poet Eileen Myles' run for president. Is it so hard to imagine such things when they do in fact exist or are on the cusp of existing, but are ignored by automated systems? Instead of imagining even these very real things, the chatbot freezes its screen and makes me acknowledge that my request "may violate its content policy" in order to continue. Then it resets, erasing my query altogether. No results, no record of my query. I want a chatbot that lives in a world that can even imagine a dyke president, or a poem about a dyke president, just like Zoe Leonard did and Eileen Myles did: "someone who has made mistakes and learned from them" instead of feeding me milquetoast lines about the importance of diversity while offering me none. 

I became anything but traumas and porn tropes and no one believed me. I mapped points of non-correspondence and they have [amassed/accreted/gathered] into more than similarity scores and Markov chains.

Queer codes and platforms. Make a note how these are related. 
The physical therapist today says when I work on muscle strength I will no longer have to contort to strange shapes to hold my body up. I think, *"That's just how queer folks sit in chairs, haven't you seen the memes? It was one of the first moments my curling in on myself — that invisibility — felt okay. If I find the muscles in my body will I no longer be queer, will I straighten, be seen?" This glitch of me, how I am a broken girl.* 

I bend my body to the plugins, wondering if language grows inside the bones the way they strengthen from being pulled by muscles, strengthened by their resistance. What is the equal and opposite force of water falling? 

Three months after our argument I am still compelled to look up the specific technical consideration that pertains to it, although we are not speaking. I find a page full of diagrams of overflow drains for bathtubs. I need to find out where the water goes. *didn't you ever learn how to take a bath*, she said, and now I know, down to the curve of the pipes. I know the overflow drain leads to the same place as the regular drain. It doesn't flood the cavity between the tub husk and the wall like I imagined when she suggested I might be damaging her home; it all drains down, through the same pipes, it all connects. Someone thought of this, someone made a place for the overflow to go. The overflow of images of drains, they overflow. I was the overflow, too much of me for the tub, too much for her, just leaking, draining all over the place, no sense, nonsense. 

I look for free stock image of this but the options are all too pleasant.

# Glitch Femme, Broken Machine
hunger makes me a modern girl
the broken machine doesn't need feeding, won't accept your mediocre fucks any longer
The broken girl is a machine. The glitch is her move. She makes space for herself, elongating the moment of error where she is most alive with possibility. Like drawing a labyrinth on the ground, she folds space to make more space from nothing, turns a line into a journey with dimensions, a pause that becomes infinitude.

What uncomfortable affects/emotions emerge when we are brought into process? When the veil falls away that divided the maker from the audience? What do process-oriented modes reveal that we don't want to see? Neoliberal disgust with imperfection. The labor being asked of us, the labor we place upon ourselves.
