I am still alive, On Kawara. I find your dailiness remarkable. It takes so much: To get up at a time in the morning. To make a painting. To make a life. To make a day. Day after day. You fit this feeling in a postcard, with a view. You just report. 

What I like about you is you don't offer any context. Just 'I got up'. Just 'I am still alive'. What more do you want from me, you seem to say. 

You wrote to Sol Lewitt. Wrote to friends in New York, France, Sweden, Yugoslavia. You wrote every day for days and days and days and days until you weren't alive. Still, I'll write to you. I am also still alive. It doesn't feel remarkable, but it is, and I mark it, remark it. 

Some people I know are also alive but don't want to be. It's hard to know how to live, especially right now. And it always has been hard to know how to live. It always has been 'especially right now'. But we each make our problems our own. We evade oneness through simple acts like 'I'. We do it on the reg. 

Such data accumulates days. Call it a lifetime.

You chose a a few basic rituals and stuck with them. All you needed [to say][ was, 'I am still alive'.] Sometimes the only affirmation a person can hold is 'I am still alive'. Sometimes it is all we can stand. Sometimes we can't even stand that. Sometimes that is enough. Sometimes even that is too much.

I got up at 9:50am. I woke up several times before that. In your 'I got up at' postcard series, the times range wildly. This makes me like you more. I resent [shows of dedication that seem to claim the moral high ground as the secret to success. Like if I really wanted to 'be an artist' I would have gotten up at 4am — as if this is the formula for everyone, as if we share the same capacities.]

A few years ago I also made an artwork that tracked all my daily habits. I felt young and girlish when I made art with my data. (Would I have felt that way if it was someone else's data, someone less young- ang girlish-seeming themselves?) I got constructive criticism like, "You sure do sleep a lot. Are you depressed?" But On Kawara, I think I slept about the same as you, and I'm sure we are both read into, and I suppose that is some part of the point, but I still didn't like the feeling. Your context was the daily paper, a postcard of a skyscraper, a telegram. My context was shared ipad screens, reading critical media theory, a looming breakup. ~~[Although who knows what might have been going on between you and your correspondees.]~~  

Later I made artworks that asked people to bring their data with them. I asked for compassion, in small portable phrases — ones that could be turned from sound into writing into data packets into sound again. At first I had to learn to like compassion at all. The art-making was a way to make it weird, to figure out how to learn to like it. To get comfortable with the sound of my voice, I had to make an artificial one that sounded like an uncanny version of me, being kinder than I was capable at the time. If it could be nicer, maybe I could be, and if I could be, maybe anyone could be. Some people seemed upset I was asking, said I was being too polite. This felt ironic, for how hard it felt to ask. This felt a lot about gender, although less and less do I want to have one. 

[A while later I got ]"IT'S OKAY TO CRY" [is] tattooed on my arm in calculator font. I need[ed] the phrase written on my body so that one day I will start to believe it. [It combines two pieces of flash art created by [Ren], who wanted to honor the life and work of musician, producer, and trans rights activist Sophie Xeon after she died unexpectedly in 2021. She slipped and fell while climbing up to look at the moon.] 

The affirmation had already appeared in the database of compassionate phrases I built. I have been continually surprised at the database, both that others do contribute and also that it remains effective at soothing me, even as I know its gimmicks. 

*It's okay to cry.*
*You'll figure it out eventually.*
*What you choose is up to you.*
**

I also planned to make an app to collect as many streams of the data I was producing as possible. And I wanted to call it the simplest name possible: "I'm still alive" Because to over-know the body through data was eventually to say nothing much at all. Collecting turned being into producing, a new kind of labor where I did nothing but my body made a profit that estranged me. Over-thinking meaning, over-writing data, working-over my overworked datapoints, rewriting the read-outs — in the ads I could become one minor market for my datafarmed self. I could replace proprioception with real-time sensor feedback. Replace interoception with outputs and analyses. It offered the illusion of insight if I would offer the non-labor I was doing anyway — sleeping, reading, breathing, thinking. But, by tracking it, extracting it, selling it, the device would bestow it value – as data. Thus, their proprietary systems would make it *into labor*. They made it valuable, not me — my sleeping, reading, breathing doesn't matter. Every day I get up at and I check my heartbeat. I attend to the device which tells me, I got up at and I write, or rather I inscribe in data, 'I got up at' and I charge these devices and I spend money and time and labor on them. Every day their systems know about me, just like Sol LeWitt did. The data I create now implicate me in advance of acts I haven't taken and devices not yet invented and crimes not yet described. Sometimes "I am still alive" is already giving too much away.

Writing to no one, a postcard out into the world (Derrida) vs an "entity" that senses your increased biometric feedback and responds to you. This desire for attunement. In the past we got it from women, trained to be wives and mothers and ignore their own readings. We look for it now in machines because we don't have enough hands on deck to provide care (because we are not willing to provide it mutually?). We have NLP reading suicide notes and doing predictive modeling for future anxious children. All well and good seeming activities, all also very minority report in its sci-fi possibility space. 



There are researchers at work using machine learning analysis to detect suicidality, particularly in children or veterans, which on the surface seems a humanitarian good but upon closer inspection is rife with *Minority Report*–esque predictive-policing problematics. Looking for patterns, you will find patterns, but what will you do with them? How far will you go in limiting someone's life to prevent their death? Analyses found a wide range of correlations: 

>"people experiencing suicidal thoughts sighed more and laughed less than others. When speaking, they tended to pause longer and to shorten their vowels, making words less intelligible; their voices sounded breathier, and they expressed more anger and less hope." [@khullarCanTreatMental2023] "having arthritis, lupus, or head-and-neck cancer; taking statins or Ambien; or living in the Western U.S. can also add to a veteran’s risk" "It’s also possible that preventing deaths takes time—that frequent touchpoints, over years, are what drive suicide rates down across a population."
>"needed a proxy for" "The algorithm’s designers needed a proxy for illness and settled on medical costs. (All things being equal, people who are sicker tend to use more health care.) Obermeyer found, however, that the algorithm dramatically underestimated how sick Black patients were, because the Black patients it examined had much lower health spending than the white patients, even when they were equally sick. Such algorithmic bias can occur not just by race, but by gender, age, rurality, income, and other factors of which we’re only dimly aware, making algorithms less accurate." 
>"Studies have shown that text-based therapy can work well. It also generates data."
>"I could have searched for the words to describe my feelings to my phone. I might have expressed them while sharing them with no one—unless you count the machines."

Recently they added a Boolean operator to Javascript called Nullish, written `??`. My feelings exactly. Nullish is meant for "when there are multiple ways something can not exist" (evelyn masso "Handling Null"). Nullish distinguishes `null` and `undefined` from other `False` and `NaN`, although all of these are 'Falsy'. Nullish hovers liminially in the never was or maybe erased. Use plain ol' `null` "when something can optionally exist." Oh to be a Nullable coalescing, there or/and nothing (masso, Sedgwick).

Someone reminds me it is not my responsibility to keep other people alive, no matter how much I care for them. But then, whose job is it? We all keep each other alive. And lately we are failing at this work, failing with dramatic speed. Unaliving at accelerating pace. 

'Unalive' is the rewriting of unspeakable death to avoid censorship by platforms. Platforms do not read between the lines. They are not reading for context clues. They cannot distinguish between deaths to discuss and deaths to erase. They cannot distinguish between queer sexuality and pornography. Although they claim to distinguish between a male nipple and a female nipple, even though gender is not real. And so we must spell out new stuttering formulations like `s3x` and `~~death~~` and `les-bean` or `les🐝an`, which fool these sophisticated systems. 

The smooth silence of drone footage over destruction. The glide above bombs and voice over. 

What does it mean to remind you (or me) that I am still alive? For audre lorde this is an act of revolution just even to live in spite of powerful forces that strive to extinguish you. Many of us [others] live on the backs of other people. Others love as [acts of devotion/devotional acts].



### who decides these things, the poetics of code standards societies
There is a new operator in ECMAScript 11 called Nullish, named appropriately and represented by my feelings exactly: ?? and it distinguishes undefined and null from false and not-a-number. Nullish, partially erased, hovering liminally. 
avoid null "when there are multiple ways something can not exist"; use null "when something can optionally exist" (masso)


And with ES9, ... the ellipses copies or clones objects. Whereas Winnie Soon discussed the throbber, and we have the rainbow beachball of doom, and the three dots of death, awaiting arrival of a message being written, or revised, or deleted, one never knows. Here an abundance. A Dolly the Sheep Dot Dot Dot. 


return to the anxiety of too many too much asked of me, no one asked, i asked this of myself, all the things i am excited for, imagine making and doing and joining
code palimpsests from Annette Vee, looking at Bakhtin's speech genres, each utterance a refraction of prior.



Later I learn that Kawara's series "I AM STILL ALIVE" started with three 1969 telegrams that directly address the suicidality latent in the rest of the project: "I NOT GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE DON’T WORRY; I AM NOT GOING TO COMMIT SUICIDE WORRY; and I AM GOING TO SLEEP FORGET IT." For whatever reason, I like these less. But don't worry, I still like you, On Kawara. I expect you're not concerned with this at all. You are not still alive. I write to you as though you are, because to write to the living who do not want to live, to write to them about living seems harder than to write to the dead about living. I expect you'd have more to say about living, having written "I am still alive" so many times. 

I think you would report back that living was not fun. Maybe you could explain to my friend, who does not want to, why you went on and did it anyway. [Did you? Checks to make sure. Whew 29,771 days. I'm happy if everyone I know sticks around that long.]

This is about knots instead of threads. This is about staying in bed. Do I have covid again? Having covid and long covid at the same time is weird. Is this the only time I write essays? I watched the Hitchcock film *Rope* last time I had covid. This time I talk with my mother about smart ways [to prevent and to get away with death], if the occasion were to call for it. We may talk more than the average family about [murder–suicide pacts. Justifiable homicide. Euthanasia.]
