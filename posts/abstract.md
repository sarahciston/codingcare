# Abstract

This dissertation argues for creative, practice-based, community-driven approaches to critical AI. 

A huge interdisciplinary community (but still a minority) are pushing for understanding, critiquing, and rethinking how we define, develop, deploy, regulate, use, and mitigate the effects of machine learning tasks, datasets, models, algorithms, architectures, and agents, which we collectively and nebulously understand as 'AI' systems. Critical AI includes critical analysis of the pitfalls of existing methods and calls for applying alternative indigenous, feminist, queer, crip, and intersectional approaches. Critical AI is distinguished from applied approaches like 'AI for Good' or 'AI for Society', which can lack critical perspectives despite their intended altruism. Critical AI as a set of mixed methods of analysis and intervention has yet to cross into standard machine learning practice as the use and awareness of AI escalates.  

*Trans\*formative TechnoCraft* demonstrates that implementing critical AI approaches into AI more broadly requires building more inviting, inclusive, [artistic/creative/playful][practical/playful/practice-based] communities — where a wider range of [individuals] can engage critically and creatively with each other and with machine learning techniques as malleable materials. The dissertation argues for building coding communities as radical spaces of belonging — activated by a politics, way of being, and ethos of co/creation modeled by queer and trans\* communities that embrace radical difference. This creates a basis for the deep interdisciplinary thought, the interrogation of formative principles, and openness to alternative forms that are necessary to [reimagine/intervene in] the AI status quo. 




By reframing cutting-edge technologies through the lens of material crafting practices like woodworking or fiber arts, coders can recast their relationships to what they create — deflating AI hype, lowering the barriers for learning, emphasizing sustainably and community. Thinking craft-as-technology honors the inherited knowledge of many outsider communities. Thinking technology-as-craft provides a framework to implement their theories, ethics, and tactics as intersectional critical AI.

"A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" offers practical guidance for conscientious dataset stewardship. It combines critical AI theories and technical data science concepts, explained in accessible language. It is paired with the "Inclusive Datasets Research Guide," an online resource written for USC Libraries. Both of these texts apply concepts from the "Intersectional AI Toolkit," which argues that anyone should be able to understand what AI is and help shape what AI ought to be. The Toolkit's co-authored zines are accessible guides to both AI and intersectionality. They find common vocabularies to connect diverse communities around AI's urgent questions. Its online resources learn from legacies of queer, feminist, antiracist, anticolonialist, and antiablest theories, ethics, and tactics, showing how established but marginalized tactics are necessary for reimagining more critical and ethical machine learning. "Coding.Care: Field Notes for Making Friends with Code" describes critical–creative programming approaches founded in the belief that anyone can contribute to the future of digital systems and that we all have skills to teach each other. It gives courage to pick up unfamiliar tools, find resources to kick off a new programming project, pose questions critically, or solve problems creatively. Its pocket-guide form discusses how to build a cooperative, interdisciplinary community for co-learning coding. As interstices between these texts, five lyric essays approach the topics of [XXX] from oblique angles. "Codes for (Un)Raveling," "Codes for (Un)Limiting, "Codes for (Un)Forming," "Codes for (Un)Living," and "Codes for (Un)Knowing" converse with five artists working primarily in 20th century analog materials, asking how these practices reflect on contemporary digital questions considered within *Trans\*formative Technocraft*. These essays (un)do the lived experience of [XXX] technology which [XXX] addresses. 

Because different modalities can better address and unite a wider range of communities, these works make interventions with different audiences by relying upon different voices, forms, formats, and media to address different stages of the sociotechnical pipelines that produce algorithmic systems like generative AI. "A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" and "Inclusive Datasets Research Guide" address journalists, students, scholars, activists, artists, and anyone starting to work with existing machine learning datasets, in the form of an instructional guidebook that combines approachable techniques with critical thinking questions, at the point when they are choosing, using, and maintaining datasets as the foundation for machine learning tasks. Intersectional AI Toolkit addresses anyone who wants to understand the automated systems that impact them by using public workshops, zines, and digital resources in order to describe key concepts and processes of machine learning through critical lenses. "Coding.Care" addresses reluctant or would-be programmers (of any age), with a warm and friendly pocketbook, at the moment where they might intervene with critical or imaginative software creation. The "Codes" essays are nonpedagogical and address nonpractitioners on a more affective and aesthetic register, meant for reflection on the impact of sociotechnical systems as they entangle with individuals and marginalized groups.

#### Design

They are produced through an ethos of process-oriented practice. The programming text is written alongside the composition text, giving them more equal weight.
Every draft is saved in a Git versioning system and all are available open-access online, making no version the 'definitive' or 'authoritative' version.

Written in Markdown, a basic, flexible text format that allows for easy reformatting and for multiple forms and outputs. The same text creates the website, the dissertation draft, and the zine booklet PDF for printing, using the command line tool Pandoc and LaTex templates.

This process of combining existing tools in new ways (duct tape methodology) is a Coding.Care strategy.
