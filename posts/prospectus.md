## CODING.CARE: A Guidebook for Trans*formative TechnoCraft

- one chapter could be a deck of (oblique) strategies, one chapter could be lyric essay, zines, digital platform, recipe, code database, flow charts

### chapter outline (fantasy table of contents)
0. Manifesto for Coding Care
   1. Coding needs an overhaul, can be rethought through care-ful, interdisciplinary, community, creative, craft-oriented practices to bring ethics and politics to code, 
   2. to imagine new more equitable systems and bring those who can make them into the conversations that will allow them to be made, and also to bring 
1. How To Guide: Creative Code Collective (a case study/how-to/lessons learned, with contributions from or interviews with members)
   1. qualitative: survey results, interviews 1:1 and written, live transcripts?
2. IAI Zines (case study of community project)
   1. code base
   2. ccc resource hub
   3. qualitative: zine making documentation
3. (case study of my individual project, inner.voice.over and/or ladymouth or ?)
4. (case study: code library or )
   1. e.g. the card decks from Nushin et al or Superrr et al or creative code berlin?
5. Lyric essay(s) (see below)

*these are the nesting dolls getting smaller and more personal*

*yes and...*
- ~~Theory/academic paper (if needed)~~
- Not-Too Oblique Strategies Deck, Distilled/Distributed How-To // or diagram/poster chart or other book art form
   1. verbs
      1. holding, caring, sharing, making, sewing
      2. shifting, listening, combining, collaborating, 
   2. metaphors - all of these are moving, mysterious, path-like, non-individualistic, symmetries, 
      1. riparian, alluvial, distributed, winding, deposited
      2. labyrinth, spiral, internalized path, knowing/not knowing the way, public
      3. thread, parallel processing, weaving and interleaving  
      4. jellyfish, translucence, malleable, ephemeral, absorbing embodied non-body, nervous system, many threads and tendrils, hard to pin down, very old, regenerative, 
      5. magpie, shiny fascinations, smart recognition, secret guilds
- Platform/Usable Tool/Object
- Lyric Essay
   <subhead>init, name, set, get</subhead> (each verb has a metaphor?)
   1. Codes for Communing (creative code collective, mutual aid, sewing kits, knitting circles, toolkits, covens, secret societies, oblique strategies)
   2. Codes for Mourning (platform, threnodies, fraying, multithreading, **thread**)
   3. Codes for Desiring (ecstatic codes, erotic politics, infinite scroll, zeno (see above, eros thanatos))
   4. Codes for Queering (trans poetic, radical imagining, futile/futurity)
   5. Codes for Disappearing (refusing, databodies, drone aesthetics, interpolated states)
   6. Codes for Essaying (exploring, unknowing, investigating, code obscura, **labyrinth**)
   7. Codes for Healing (hearing, hiding, helping, gathering, saving, salve, poultice, protecting, healing each other) 
   8. Codes for Risking, Codes for Losing (anthropocene, pandemic, posthuman, vulnerability, **moon palace**)

## abstract

What are the codes we don't have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? 

What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things? 


## project description (notes, 5-8p) / 1200-1500 words (5-6p)
* hybrid, lyric, perf, non-technical/non-academic
* space for a personal(data) practice woven with a community practice
* artist-technician, activist-engineer, documentation-code library, print-digital hybrids (venn diagram 4 circles)

* ~~an aggregator of others' tools?~~

## methodologies
* intersectional feminisms
* queer feminist media praxis, making/crafting, urgentcraft
* queer futurity, queer failure, obfuscation, passing & flagging, survival
* digital humanities and digital scholarly publishing
* zine culture, punk/riotgrrl counter-cultural print publishing, avant-garde art/poetry, fluxus, oulipo
* interdependence is indigenous knowledge

### concepts
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts
* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **trans\***: inclusive, fluid, nonbinary, change-focused, self-identifying, embodied & emergent, evolving
* **transformative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices
* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered
* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied, tinkering

Therefore **Coding Care** is XXXX

And **Trans*formative programming**, inspired in part by histories of transformative justice, recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems, and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it and to imagining and creating different, even healing systems. While reparative and restorative also have resonance with this project, the terms' relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Meanwhile a broader sense of transformation and the added layers of resonance with trans\*-inclusive approaches to gender, sexuality, identity, and imaginative futures seems more befitting of this project, its participants, and its intentions. The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

And **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne.
