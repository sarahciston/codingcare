## abstract

What are the codes we don't have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? 

What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things?

## methodologies
* intersectional feminisms
* queer feminist media praxis, making/crafting, urgentcraft
* queer futurity, queer failure, obfuscation, passing & flagging, survival
* digital humanities and digital scholarly publishing
* zine culture, punk/riotgrrl counter-cultural print publishing, avant-garde art/poetry, fluxus, oulipo
* interdependence is indigenous knowledge

### concepts
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts
* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **trans\***: inclusive, fluid, nonbinary, change-focused, self-identifying, embodied & emergent, evolving
* **transformative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices
* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered
* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied, tinkering

Therefore **Coding Care** is XXXX

And **Trans*formative programming**, inspired in part by histories of transformative justice, recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems, and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it and to imagining and creating different, even healing systems. While reparative and restorative also have resonance with this project, the terms' relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Meanwhile a broader sense of transformation and the added layers of resonance with trans\*-inclusive approaches to gender, sexuality, identity, and imaginative futures seems more befitting of this project, its participants, and its intentions. The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

And **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne.

## Chapter: Guidebook

### Creative Code Collective: TechnoCraft and Trans*formative Programming as Community Practice

Learning programming is often intimidating and riddled with false starts, which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges sociotechnology presents. This paper outlines a guidebook to alternative pedagogy for creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. 

As a case study, the guidebook details the approaches developed in Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in 2019 for emerging artist–coders and non-engineers to think critically with code in a welcoming, inclusive space. I launched this group for students learning creative-critical coding skills after my own struggles learning code—in particular coming to code as a writer learning to make electronic literature. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed—a less-intimidating environment that moved away from dry CS textbooks and toward approaches like Nick Montfort’s “programming as inquiry” and Rachel Simanjuntak’s “care as artistic practice.” The Collective also aligns its viewpoint with texts like Geoff Cox and Winnie Soon’s Aesthetic Programming, which purposefully teaches creative code situated within its critical and political stakes, and which also embodies that politics by inviting others to fork the book. 

This approach uses creative-critical code pedagogy as a holistic community practice. This paper will look at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored as a group and some we have developed. I will discuss how practices in the Collective—like project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its guiding values, like “scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code” and “collaboration not competition.” I will also discuss some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the three-year-old community—including how our practices adapted from in-person to virtual spaces during the pandemic and how our community evolved through the shift to online platforms and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. To close out the discussion of tactics, I will point to existing methodology from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, anti-racist theory; and make connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and the Processing Foundation. 

In terms of impact, I’ll touch on the ways students report these practices and values have shaped them as emerging artists, coders, and thinkers. I have found that this community deeply influences my own work as a creative-critical coder, writer of experimental electronic literature, and tactical media artist working with natural language processing tools. Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice. This allows me to model for students my own vulnerability as an artist-researcher, which reciprocally becomes the best teaching tool of all. In sum, Creative Code Collective positions an ethics of coding care—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: “We all have something to teach each other.” 

Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for a kind of literacy that reaches beyond an existing Silicon Valley paradigm  that “anyone can join,” but rather reimagines technoculture for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.
