## abstract

What are the codes we don't have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? 

What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things? 


The _Anarchist’s Tool Chest_ says there is power in a small set of tools, known intimately and carried easily. Its author Christopher Schwarz calls this "a radical and rare idea that can help change the world." This idea is missing from AI tools, which require massive technical knowhow and financial resources to operate.

The work done with Intersectional AI Toolkit and Creative Code Collective both argues that anyone should be able to understand the key tools of technology and should have the power to reimagine the systems that impact them most.

### concepts
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts
* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **trans\***: inclusive, fluid, nonbinary, change-focused, self-identifying, embodied & emergent, evolving. the asterisk searches for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable.  
* **formative**: fundamental, foundational experiences. what shapes us
* **trans*formative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices
* **processing**: another word for programming, processing focuses not on the end product or task but the inter/intra action, the digestion that happens. of code. of trauma. of information. 
* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered
* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied, tinkering

Therefore **Coding Care** is XXXX

And **Trans*formative processing** inspired in part by histories of transformative justice, recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems, and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it and to imagining and creating different, even healing systems. While reparative and restorative also have resonance with this project, the terms' relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Meanwhile a broader sense of transformation and the added layers of resonance with trans\*-inclusive approaches to gender, sexuality, identity, and imaginative futures seems more befitting of this project, its participants, and its intentions. The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

And **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne.

## Chapter: Guidebook

### Creative Code Collective: A How-To Guide for Programming As a Caring Community Practice

Learning programming is often intimidating and riddled with false starts, which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. This guidebook offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. The guide takes as its case study Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in 2019 for emerging media artists, writers, and non-engineers to think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Designed for students from all backgrounds, especially those who have not had the opportunity to code before, the Collective is an intersectional intervention responding to the need for supportive spaces that value students’ diverse capacities to learn. It draws on approaches like Nick Montfort’s "programming as inquiry" and Rachel Simanjuntak’s "care as artistic practice." The Collective also aligns its viewpoint with Geoff Cox and Winnie Soon's _Aesthetic Programming_, which purposefully teaches creative code situated within critical and political stakes, and which also embodies that politics by inviting others to fork the book. 

The Collective takes creative-critical code pedagogy as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition." It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now three-year-old community, including how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methodology from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work in electronic literature, tactical media, and natural language processing. Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice. This allows me to model for students my vulnerability as an artist-researcher, which reciprocally becomes the best teaching tool of all. 

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an ethics of coding care—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: “We all have something to teach each other.” Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly “anyone can join.” Rather, it reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.
