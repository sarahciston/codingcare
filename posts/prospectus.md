## title
**CODING.CARE: A Guidebook for Trans*formative TechnoCraft**
(accompanying oblique strategies deck? flow/org chart)

- one chapter could be a deck of strategies, one chapter could be lyric essay, zines, digital platform, recipe, code database

### chapter outline (fantasy table of contents)
0. Manifesto for Coding Care
   1. Coding needs an overhaul, can be rethought through care-ful, interdisciplinary, community, creative, craft-oriented practices to bring ethics and politics to code, 
   2. to imagine new more equitable systems and bring those who can make them into the conversations that will allow them to be made, and also to bring 
1. How To Guide: Creative Code Collective (a case study/how-to/lessons learned, with contributions from or interviews with members)
2. IAI Zines (case study of community project)
   1. code base
   2. ccc resource hub
3. (case study of individual project, innver.voice.over or ladymouth or ?)
4. (case study: library )
5. Lyric essay (see below)
*these are the nesting dolls getting smaller and more personal*

- ~~Theory/academic paper (if needed)~~
- Not-Too Oblique Strategies Deck, Distilled/Distributed How-To // or diagram/poster chart or other book art form
   1. verbs
      1. 
   2. metaphors
      1. riparian, alluvial, distributed, winding, deposited
      2. labyrinth, spiral, internalized path, knowing/not knowing the way

   1. Codes for Communing (creative code collective, mutual aid, sewing kits, knitting circles, toolkits, covens, secret societies, oblique strategies)
   2. Codes for Mourning (platform, threnodies, fraying, multithreading, **thread**)
   3. Codes for Desiring (ecstatic codes, erotic politics, infinite scroll, zeno (see above, eros thanatos))
   4. Codes for Queering (trans poetic, radical imagining, futile/futurity)
   5. Codes for Disappearing (refusing, databodies, drone aesthetics, interpolated states)
   6. Codes for Essaying (exploring, unknowing, investigating, code obscura, **labyrinth**)
   7. Codes for Healing (hearing, hiding, helping, gathering, saving, salve, poultice, protecting, healing each other) 
   8. Codes for Risking, Codes for Losing (anthropocene, pandemic, posthuman, vulnerability, **moon palace**)

## abstract

What are the codes we don't have but need? The codes we run unthinkingly, written into us, that we could rewrite with more care and attention? 

What is programming in ways that reimagine how we have already been programmed? To think of programming very narrowly, as meant for only certain kinds of people, meant to do only certain kinds of things?

* *guidebook* small print run artist *books* (slipcase), *tarot/cards/oblique strategies* with *manifesto*
* website version, continually updating, with version control, database
* series of lyric essays, that are also 
* series of *lectures*, nonlinear, aphoristic, networked, *Four Times Through the Labyrinth* a 
* toolkit: *wiki/documentation* (wiki.js) + *zine library*
* *prototype, wiki/git* creative-critical-code writing, featuring:

* *community*: *discord* group with Emily, cauldron, *creative code collective*

## methodologies
* intersectional feminisms
* queer feminist media praxis, making/crafting, urgentcraft
* queer futurity, queer failure, obfuscation, passing & flagging, survival
* digital humanities and digital scholarly publishing
* zine culture, punk/riotgrrl counter-cultural print publishing, avant-garde art/poetry, fluxus, oulipo

### concepts
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts
* **care**: interrelational, mutual aid, healing-centered
* **trans\***: inclusive, fluid, nonbinary, change-focused, self-identifying
* **transformative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices
* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented  
* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied

Therefore **Coding Care** is XXXX

And **Trans*formative programming**, inspired in part by histories of transformative justice, recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems, and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it and to imagining and creating different, even healing systems. While reparative and restorative also have resonance with this project, the terms' relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Meanwhile a broader sense of transformation and the added layers of resonance with trans\*-inclusive approaches to gender, sexuality, identity, and imaginative futures seems more befitting of this project, its participants, and its intentions. The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

And **TechnoCraft** is 

* handmade, craft, iterative, durational practices
* ~~reparative, restorative~~ transformative justice > transformative processing/programming
* immersive data identities
* intersectional AI
* communities of practice
* queer feminist infrastructures & queer use
* queer histories of computing
* not classifying, a radical queer computing not based on classification but woven from the unknowing of genderless expression, of story
  * >>"his knowledge is not classificatory but storied, not totalising and synoptic but open-ended and exploratory." (Ingold 2015, 48)
* deep interdisciplinarity
* toolkit >>"space of 'instruction, contingency, action, and alternative engagement' (Gabrys 20XX, 92)"
