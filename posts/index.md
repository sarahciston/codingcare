<!-- <caption markdown=1>I have lived and worked on the ancestral land of the Tongva, Chumash, Ohlone, Muwekma, Miwok, and Kumeyaay people (California); the Osage and Kickapoo people (Missouri); and on the site where many Jewish, Roma, queer, and disabled communities were displaced during the Shoah (Berlin). I acknowledge the suffering and struggle that have made my presence here possible, and I work to support dismantling the paradigms that allow such suffering to continue — in Palestine and in too much of the world.

The dissertation offers guides for building critical–creative coding communities as radical spaces of belonging — activated by a politics, ways of being, and ethos of co-creation modeled by queer and trans\* communities that embrace radical difference.

<!-- ### About this collection -->

Critical AI researchers see the urgent need to understand and rethink how AI systems are defined, developed, regulated, and mitigated. *Coding.Care: Guidebooks for Intersectional AI* argues that implementing critical approaches into AI systems more broadly requires building inviting, inclusive spaces where more people can engage creatively and critically with each other and with machine learning techniques as malleable materials. The project demonstrates craft-based, process-oriented approaches to AI that can help meet this challenge. 

The dissertation presents guides for fostering critical–creative coding communities as radical spaces of belonging—activated by an ethos and a politics modeled by queer and trans* communities that embraces radical difference. This creates a basis for deep interdisciplinary thought, interrogation of formative principles, and an openness to co-creation and alternative forms necessary to reimagine AI. 

Artists, activists, scholars, and technologists can recast their relationships to emerging technologies by reframing them as crafts like crochet—deflating AI hype, lowering barriers to learning, and emphasizing sustainability and process. Thinking craft-as-technology honors the inherited knowledge of many outsider communities. Thinking technology-as-craft provides a framework to implement those theories, ethics, and tactics as intersectional critical AI. 

The guides in *Coding.Care* deal with machine learning datasets, intersectional AI, coding communities, and embodied algorithmic art. Together, they want to meet readers where they are—as non-academics or those bridging into new fields, looking for a common vocabulary to engage conscientiously with the urgent concerns of AI systems. *Coding.Care* offers an expansive invitation to deepen interdisciplinary conversation, apply intersectional approaches, and rework AI systems from critical–creative–caring perspectives.

<!-- ## Abstract -->

<!-- <span class="purple">Learning programming is often intimidating and riddled with false starts,</span> which can further marginalize the folks whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. This guidebook offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. It focuses on Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in 2019 for emerging media artists, writers, and non-engineers to think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Here, we see creative-critical code as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its <span class="purple">guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition."</span> It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now 3+ years-old community, like how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methods from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work. <span class="purple">Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</span>

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an <span class="purple">ethics of coding care</span>—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: "We all have something to teach each other." Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly "anyone can join." Rather, Coding.Care reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.  -->
