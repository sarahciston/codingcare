# Codes for (Un)Knowing
#### Codes for Essaying, Codes for Risking, Codes for Losing

Inside, the black box bursts with color. It’s a whole tiny world in there, a homunculus of meaning. A giant moon crashes into the bedroom and continues its orbit. Pipi screams silently, reaching up from the floor, where she sinks within her tiny television. The flames behind her never quite engulf her, as if to say, memelike: *This Is Fine.* 

I am writing again about trapped white women and problems of scale. Pipi has arranged all the white things on the wall. All the white things are sorted and inert, aesthetically unnerving in a pleasing way. It is living as an algorithm to find and sort and display this way. I do it too. [We all do.] 

It seems merely rote to sort what will be important and what will not be. This is power. Here, on Pipi's wall of white things, the criteria may seem obvious: white, or white-enough. But we do not see the discarded. Their not-quite-whiteness holds up this wall with their exclusion. [This is about what is inside the black box. "Black box" is thought-experiment shorthand for the unknown — space that is presumed unknowable or doesn't need knowing. ]

[XXX][nora on black box and limits of explainability]

Pipi, your rooms are joyful violations, written in slow motion, calling for tiny complete attention. You dress in like a periwinkle dream and smash windows with a tropical flower. You say color is a feminist statement.

Perhaps that explains our obsession with the black box. People just love the idea there is 'no way to know' what's inside. Like a uterus. Like a black hole. But a black box is not a black hole. A black box should not be where you put something you want to go away. A thing whose insides you want to ignore. These viscera make systems. They are hungry for data. 

Remember that virtual assistant's voice is the disembodied ghost of a sawed-in-half magician's assistant. She never made it out of that black box. She still wants to razzle dazzle you. She still wants to distract you from magic. 

We were transfixed. We watched your videos lying down, touching just at the tops of our heads and at our hands, our legs splayed out in the museum ocean floor dark. Pipi, your wicked game is riddled with ocean plastic and makes me giggle inappropriately. Everything processed by a black box will eventually sink to the bottom as indigestible trash. At least with black holes nothing comes back out. *No IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII don’t wanna fall in love,* you shrieked, and I tried to maintain the feeling that I did.  

It seemed so fizzy with potential. I was uneasy but I didn't listen. I misclassified the unease as fizz. Misclassification gets me every time. I find room for multiple meanings, a room for each meaning, staged rooms made too lovely to be lived in. We moved in. The two of us sat on Pipi's sofa and watched her boulder as if it were our TV. We moved in together when we thought the pandemic would last six weeks.

I am writing again about bodies in boxes. 

What does this black box have to do with the white room we are in? 

[What is it about Pipi's work that makes me think of black boxes, different kinds of intelligences?]

The first black boxes held memory, trauma, relation: 

>"suppose I am in a friend's house and, as a car goes past outside, his dog rushes to a corner of the room and cringes. To me the behaviour is causeless and inexplicable. Then my friend says, 'He was run over by a car six months ago.' The behaviour is now accounted for by reference to an event of six months ago. If we say that the dog shows 'memory' we refer to much the same fact—that his behaviour can be explained, not by reference to his state now but to what his state was six months ago. If one is not careful one says that the dog 'has' memory, and then thinks of the dog as having something, as he might have a patch of black hair."

The term 'black box' [is/was] first introduced to the new field of artificial intelligence in W. Ross Ashby's 1956 book *An Introduction to Cybernetics*. For Ashby, "real objects are in fact all Black Boxes." Black boxes are like memory. Memory is not objective, but observed and relational, and "to invoke 'memory' in a system as an explanation of its behaviour is equivalent to declaring that one cannot observe the system completely." [For cybernetics, then, a system's memory explains current behavior that does not fit its homeostatic norms, except in relation to past trauma.][Jumping forward to today's large models, does that make the model a memory [bank/storage], and the memory is the [recaller/where you put past trauma.]

Why, in my mind, does Ashby's scene with the dog occur in my grandparents' house, where I never spent time? [Is it because they were both engineers?]

In Ashby's other colorful examples of black boxes, an engineer examines a broken bomb sight, a small child learns to open a door, and an object "has just fallen from a Flying Saucer." Bombs, children, animals, and aliens become the proving grounds where current concepts of "artificial intelligence" emerge. So much violence is built in to the black box from the start. Ashby says, "we have in fact been operating with Black Boxes all our lives," and all I hear is trauma, trauma, trauma.

How does a model hold memory? I used to hold memory just like a black box: act on it, try not to know what's inside. Don't know it, don't use it; don't change, don't hurt. 

Put it all in the black box. [Fred Moten and Stefano Harney on the legacies of [slavery-capital]:]"Ownership was a feedback loop. The more you own the more you own yourself" [@harneyAllIncomplete2021].

My father keeps everything so that he never loses anything. He never uses anything so that it never breaks. He says, "Don't own anything, then you won't have to move it." He means, "Don't love anything more than it loves you." His exact words are "The person who cares more loses." This is how I learned loss prevention. I learned early and it stuck. I learned it did not work. I heard, "Do as I say, not as I do." 

The first theft was ownership, and the first object of ownership was the body. The enlightenment produced "a science of loss, which is to say the science of whiteness, or, logistics" [@harneyAllIncomplete2021]. [Pipi, I think you know about this. Your wall of white objects assures me — everything cleaned, pinned, removed from its context and routes of arrival.] 

This is black box living, the refusal to know in any way that might know you back. I am trying to recode my[self/memory] to accept the risk of knowing, to accept its grief as a [marker] of having [loved/cared] in full. Call this the difference between touching and holding. [Touching shares, holding clings. Touching undoes the body, loses the self (or the illusion there ever was one). Touching textures you back.]

To make memory, take rubbings of surfaces [to remember them]. Press or rub one thing against another thing, and whichever thing is harder transfers its texture, making an impression in the softer thing. A pattern appears only where they touch. And in return, the softer thing transfers its particles, marking the harder thing back. This is a form of relief. 

[But rubbing is also a removal. In the [white cube of my] shower I rub the skin to remove the skin. So much of me comes off. So much of me refuses. ]

The residual is what's left. Between a prediction (an expected result) and a prediction (a model's output) is error. The amount of 'error' can be reduced by attending to what they call 'loss'. Error is measured by various functions for loss. These loss functions tell you how wrong you are, how far off your attempt. 

Loss functions as an instructive, if you let it. "Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous," says Frank O'Hara. I keep practicing to let this be true. What can be generated with/in this residual[, this refusal? ][In a "refusal to prevent loss"?] 

>"how we evade ownership/equilibrium is precisely in that refusal to prevent loss we call sharing, rubbing, empathy, hapticality: the undercommon love of flesh, our essential omnicentric or anacentric eccentricity. Everything, in the wake of such disordering, is loss prevention."

In logistics and insurance, loss prevention refers to what is stolen. It is factored in as a normal cost of doing business. To calculate loss is to tuck it away. Twenty thousand dead. Becomes a [rounding error.] Two hundred thousand. 

Reject the codes for loss prevention. Call it excess instead of error. 

Pipi, stuck in the TV, screaming silently to get out, I always feel like you are falling, falling, losing, stuck, lost. 




Another system emerges with the black box, says Ashby, that of the relation between the black box and its examiner: "the experimenter is coupling himself to the Box, so that the two together form a system with feedback" and I imagine myself tethered to all the black boxes making judgments that affect my dailiness. I am the Alexa voice and the magician's assistant, stuck to the box because my legs are in the other half.  



Later he says of black box theory, 
>"no skill is called for! We are assuming, remember, that nothing is known about the Box, and when this is so the method of making merely random variations [...] is as defensible as any other method, for no facts yet exist"

This is backward. By calling it a black box I have decided to assume from the start that nothing is known, or can be known. Then I use that 'unknowability' — which I declared rather than discovered — as justification not to investigate. Seems rude. I only have to know it by its interface, the parts I want to interact with that are of use to me, the knobs I want to turn and switches I want to flip, the parameters I want to adjust. 

Black box theory insists on unknowability as a way to instrumentalize. But there are other ways of unknowing which are sweeter. I can insist on your unknowability and stay present with it, to be in relation to you, I can stay curious about you to keep our relationship alive and lively. I can let you impact me. I can prevent loss with something other than a loss function. 


When I made [ladymouth](), I wanted to treat it like a black box, to shove everything inside that I didn't want to know about the horrible things being said on the internet about women. It doesn't work this way of course. The box, in all its colorful language, in all its complex code, requires tending — and I began to care for it. I even began to care about the people being cruel to it. ladymouth is a lot more like Pipilotti's mouth, wet mouthing the screen, like the GIFs I made of my lips repeating, silently, the words of yet another poem about gender. 




dismantling -> system keeps everything intact eg not touching, modular, defined

a calculation for what is lost. to function through or with or because of a loss. 

loss prevention in insurance or supply chain is a term for how much is stolen, and it is calculated in as the normal cost of doing business

>A few statistics: In 2011 $9.2 billion worth of supply chain theft was reported. In 2011, US supply chain crime cost retailers $2.5 billion. In 2011, there were 585,000 supply chain crime events. The cost of supply chain crime is $23 billion per year. Why such a huge concern for the insurance and supply chain sector? Well, look at a few examples: [gpt not fact checked]

Pipi's show says, "happiness, be my neighbor" (not, be mine)

*Happiness, be my neighbor.* Call this queer epistemologies. I am still striving for that Queer Modus Operating System. 

In a wiki, a stub is an article that should exist but does not, a mere suggestion of knowledge that is probably out there but which no one has documented. It is potential energy, an invitation to contribute. A heralding. A summoning. A convocation. A reaching node in the network, a synapse growing. A bid for attention. The opposite of a loss. 


There are other kinds of boxes, not abstract monotone cubes. There are handcrafted cedar chests with dovetailed corners, with knitted blankets and passed down quilts inside. There are gestures of care and contact. There are ways to keep warm. 

Dovetailed joints are carved like tiny fans, and they don't require glue or nails. They rely on the tension pulling them apart to hold them together. Dovetailedness is a strategy. [You can only pull them apart from a single secret side.] Handcarved wooden boxes (they don't make them like they used to)  

>"the tectonic would become ‘the art of joinings’." (Ingold)



>There are two kinds of touch: skin-on-skin and skin-on-paper. With skin-on-skin touch, your fingertips are closer to your heart. Your senses are better able to register the depth of the other person's emotions. Skin-on-paper touch is the kind that most of us learn to handle by the age of five. We learn that physical contact is important and necessary for bonding. But skin-on-paper touch is often too abstract.

Female media artists of the 1970s were doing this work before your natural language processing sentiment analysis. 
She crowdsourced 109 different affects. I’ve paired each with an emoji and put them into a spreadsheet and I call this sheet a short story/lyric essay.

Continually feeding the black box feels like standing in the white glow of the refrigerator cube past midnight even though I'm stuffed. I outsource analysis to the mawing void. I put my body in the shame space.

~~We’d like it to be so simple, outsource the problem to a rational agent. This, no, this one, is the safe and sensible dataset, the clear path—every problem its decision tree accurately modeled to arboreal aesthetic perfection. But the trees tell other stories, the whorls of wood want other histories for us, histories that don’t come from past predictions for the future.~~

~~We’d like it to be so simple, the myth of a single rational agent within us, in the box, containable.~~


When we tell stories, we make use of everything we know about everyone we’ve ever met to imagine new characters. From those generalizations, we draw out some specific features and apply them to an imagined new person. Hopefully we flesh those out enough, combining them in unique ways and adding situations and motivations that make the new person feel full and fleshy too. 

~~But when we move the other direction—from specific to general—that spells trouble.~~ When we use stereotypes, statistics, machine learning, we draw out generalizations about existing individuals by selecting only a few features about them we’ve decided are important, and then applying those qualities to other individuals and presuming to know them both. Whether or not these assumptions are "correct" according to the machine's calculations ~~machine sex~~ is not the only concern (although a huge one). Also, these assumptions are built on false categorizations, these assumptions ghosts staked on unreliable frameworks and foundations in the first place. Further, they reduce the unique, irreducible multitude of features that exist within each person. These generalizations are rules used to identify, sort, and control all of us—to dangerous ends.
