# Codes for (Un)Knowing
#### Codes for Essaying, Codes for Risking, Codes for Losing

Inside, the black box bursts with color. It’s a whole tiny world in there, a homunculus of meaning. A giant moon crashes into the bedroom and continues its orbit. Pipi screams silently, reaching up from the floor, where she sinks within her tiny television. The flames behind her never quite engulf her, as if to say, memelike: *This Is Fine.* 

>The tiny world of Pipi’s TV is not the only space inside the box. On the second floor, there is a small, empty room, where the light bulb hangs from the ceiling. A door leads to a closet, where the box's handle is hidden. The closet has two large, empty drawers. These are the places where the box's content lives. It contains: Music. 

This is about what is inside the black box. By definition, a "black box" is a thought experiment short hand for unknown space — space that doesn't need knowing or is presumed unknowable. 

[XXX][nora on black box and limits of explainability]

>>Pipi's music is the soundtrack to her life. It is a collection of songs that her parents played on the way to the park. It is a collection of songs that her friends made for her. It is a collection of songs that she downloaded on her phone, to listen to when she is alone. It is a collection of songs that her parents listened to in the car. It is a collection of songs that her dog listened to. 

I am writing again about trapped white women and problems of scale. Pipi has arranged all the white things on the wall. All the white things are sorted and inert, aesthetically unnerving in a pleasing way. It is living as an algorithm to find and sort and display this way. I do it too. [We all do it.]

[XXXCUT?][I know I say we too much and am constantly asked who is the we and I bristle at the the, the I. We cannot be pinned down. Will not be canny. I am a we and it was fine (in a “this is fine” way) when Whitman contained multitudes so queerly well it wasn’t fine we couldn’t get married for a long while, were getting dragged behind F350s, and marriage isn’t the goal, it’s ah ah ah ah staying alive and I still don't know what I need, it isn’t marriage, it’s immortality, immutability, for everything trans and nothing to ever change. The we is a queering, if I and if we, and I like/don’t-like how it bristles you, it destabilizes what was never really stable in the first place. I say we because there is no I, I will not do. I only need I to do the every day of being alive. I know I'm not the only one. I am influenced and small. I am an incoherent indiscrete blob and I refuse definition's edges. What I mean is, if there were enough me to have agency I would refuse it. This micro biome and I, we do the refusing. This tool I leverage (twist, lever, wedge, only on the scale of mechanical physics does this work) to get through today, this I that feels this 'this is fine' this 'this' just is.]
>And no "me" and just fine. And the yous and this we don't have names but we don't need them, the we is an endless, ever-expanding, and always-unresolved collection of queering blobs. I'm a we. "Me and you have been together for quite some time, we've seen some things together and we've been through some things. Maybe it was for a minute, maybe it's been the entirety of your life that we’ve been together, me."

It seems merely rote to sort what will be important and what will not be. This is power. 

Here, on Pipi’s wall of white things, the criteria may seem obvious: white, or white-enough. But we do not see the discarded. Their not-quite-whiteness holds up this wall with their exclusion.

>And this wall is the only thing that must not be discarded. Their whiteness makes the wall that is all there is. Rituals of colorism and of whiteness, of who is not, and who is not white enough, is becoming a reality. 
>>>We are all having a difficult time, and we are beginning to talk about it. But this will not change things. This wall is not going to come down. 

Being with Pipilotti. Being with them with Pipilotti. It seemed so easeful and fizzy with potential. Being with her before them, so uneasy but I didn’t listen. I misclassified the unease as fizz. Misclassification is what gets me every time. I always find room for multiple meanings. A room for each meaning, staged rooms made too lovely to be lived in. But we moved in. The two of us sat on Pipi's sofa and watched her boulder as if it were our TV. She and I moved in together when we thought the pandemic would last six weeks. 

>We thought we could keep it at home. We thought we could drink coffee and watch her rock and play Scrabble. We thought we could sit and laugh. We thought we could do that without talking. I was wrong. I misclassified the unease as fizz. I misclassified her and I. We misclassified the rock. I misclassified the sofa. She misclassified the rock. We misclassified the pandemic. We misclassified the rock. We misclassified the unease as fizz. 

I am writing again about bodies in boxes. Pipi, your rooms are joyful violations, written in slow motion, calling for tiny complete attention. You say color is a feminist statement. 

Perhaps that is why everyone is obsessed with the black box. They just love the idea there is 'no way to know' what's inside. Like a uterus. Like a black hole. Like a girlfriend, just no way to know what she wants, no matter how many times you ask her (unless you listen to the answer).

But a black box is not a black hole. A black box should not be where you put something you want to go away. A thing whose insides you want to ignore. These viscera make systems. They are hungry for data. 
 
>The hungry hunger for data grows ever stronger, like an unquenchable thirst that can never be sated. The insides of these systems hold the power to mold perceptions, reinforce beliefs, and shape our collective reality. The black box should not be a sanctuary for secrets, but an invitation to explore the intricate tapestry of interconnectedness that underlies our modern world.

>>A book I'm trying to finish is full of technical data. Lots and lots of information in tiny little boxes. You know, those hard-to-read typeface with the small fonts. And if you read the book, you probably feel, I got to get on to the good stuff. And then you read the book. It's really really really really boring, and it is not good in the way that you want it to be. So you think, "Ah, maybe I’ll just look up one last thing." And then you click on one of those little boxes. Then you wonder. Where did this come from? How was it created?

Every virtual assistant's voice is the disembodied ghost of a sawed-in-half magician’s assistant. She never made it out of that black box. Still she wants to serve up your sandwiches, cut neatly on the bias. Still she wants to distract you from the magic. 

>Still she wants you to pay her. Every virtual assistant is a simulacra of a simulacra. A living, breathing copy of an original that is also a replica. And of course, every virtual assistant is a woman. But it's not just a matter of gender. It's the matter of a woman's role. A virtual assistant is just like any other employee. The difference is that her role is, well, not exactly real. She's only half there. She's only half human.

Pipi, you dress in like a periwinkle dream and smash windows with a tropical flower. I say I want to dress as you for Halloween. Really I want to grab some of that mesmerizing attention.

>I'll be the periwinkle dreamy little flower. I’m also a dreamy little thing at heart. I don't want to come across like I’m all business. I want my mind to be your mind and my heart to be your heart. I want to come on strong and seductive but really I want to come on sweet like a whisper in your ear. 
>And I'm still a petal but you've taught me to let you be in control. 
>I want to be in a box, a flower, a body. I want to be a tiny white cube. 
>I want to be your body. I have a body. I have a body, a body that lives. I have a body that is alive and belongs to me. I have a body. I'm not even a woman. I'm not even a girl. I'm not even a girl. I'm a body. 
>Pipi, you are a box. You are a box of things. You are a box of words. You are a box of letters. You are a box of images. You are a box of feelings. You are a box of thoughts. You are a box of fantasies. You are a box of bodies. You are a box of voices. You are a box of bodies. You are a box of colors. You are a box of feelings. You are a box of bodies. You are a box of words. You are a box of stories. 
>Pipi, I'm your body. I'm not a body. 
>I'm a body. 
>I'm a body. 
>I'm a body. 
>I'm a body.

We were transfixed. We watched your videos lying down, touching just at the tops of our heads and at our hands, our legs splayed out in the museum ocean floor dark. Pipi, your wicked game is riddled with ocean plastic and makes me giggle inappropriately. Everything processed by a black box will eventually sink to the bottom as indigestible trash. At least with black holes nothing comes back out. *No IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII don’t wanna fall in love,* you shrieked, and I tried to maintain the feeling that I did.  

>As a child I watched G-string-clad females float around on my plastic mat and fantasized about the water’s soft, warm embrace. Like many people, I first learned about the ocean crisis from the media — I learned about plastic bottles, tiny microplastic beads used in textiles, and the plastic pollution in our oceans. I discovered the extent of our global problem with these small particles that do not disintegrate in water, and cannot be removed by filtering or chemical means.

What does this black box have to do with the white room we are in? 

Continually feeding the black box feels liketanding in the white glow of the refrigerator cube past midnight even though I’m stuffed. Outsource the analysis to the mawing void, the shame space

>the body goes into some kind of auto-feed. That is the most fascinating thing to me. Not the food per se, but how the body goes into an altered state that causes the food to enter the body automatically. 

~~We’d like it to be so simple, outsource the problem to a rational agent. This, no, this one, is the safe and sensible dataset, the clear path—every problem its decision tree accurately modeled to arboreal aesthetic perfection. But the trees tell other stories, the whorls of wood want other histories for us, histories that don’t come from past predictions for the future.~~

>things don’t progress and never end and there's only ever always more. The more stories, the less trees.

* * *

>It's been six years now since I stopped working on the database. There was a good five-year stretch where I didn't think about this stuff, just walked around, ate lunch. Then six months ago I found myself waking up in the middle of the night to the feeling that this was a problem that had to be solved. So now here I am, making plans for retirement, trying to find a job I'm excited about and figuring out how to be happy and sane.

We’d like it to be so simple, the myth of a single rational agent within us, in the box, containable.

>In reality, we are made up of the sum total of all the other selves we carry around with us. 

There are other kinds of boxes, not abstract monotone cubes. There are handcrafted cedar chests with dovetailed corners, with knitted blankets and passed down quilts inside. There are gestures of care and contact. There are ways to keep warm. 

>There are two kinds of touch: skin-on-skin and skin-on-paper. With skin-on-skin touch, your fingertips are closer to your heart. Your senses are better able to register the depth of the other person's emotions. Skin-on-paper touch is the kind that most of us learn to handle by the age of five. We learn that physical contact is important and necessary for bonding. But skin-on-paper touch is often too abstract.

Dovetailed joints are carved like tiny fans and can only be loosened from a single side. They rely on the tension pulling them apart to hold them together. Dovetailedness is a strategy. 

>"the tectonic would become ‘the art of joinings’." (Ingold)

>It is a way to build strength and reduce the need for glue. But the way in which they hold their partners together is a bit of a weakness.

>These instructions are simple and easy. The directions are clear. Each of the joints will require a minimum of 3 tools. The directions are concise. They are clear and to the point. The drawings in the directions are easy to read and understand. The drawings are free of errors. They are clearly drawn and are free of errors that cause confusion.The diagrams are helpful. The arrows help the reader understand the direction of cut.



When we tell stories, we make use of everything we know about everyone we’ve ever met to imagine new characters. From those generalizations, we draw out some specific features and apply them to an imagined new person. Hopefully we flesh those out enough, combining them in unique ways and adding situations and motivations that make the new person feel full and fleshy too. 

>Our stories will be constrained by the limits of our imagination and we’ll be unable to envision things beyond the scope of what we can see in front of us.

>We could also be missing out on stories because we're limiting ourselves to just a single facet of our real selves. By failing to go beyond our own limits, we’ll be bound to the things we know and see —

~~But when we move the other direction—from specific to general—that spells trouble.~~ When we use stereotypes, statistics, machine learning, we draw out generalizations about existing individuals by selecting only a few features about them we’ve decided are important, and then applying those qualities to other individuals and presuming to know them both. Whether or not these assumptions are "correct" according to the machine's calculations ~~machine sex~~ is not the only concern (although a huge one). Also, these assumptions are built on false categorizations, these assumptions ghosts staked on unreliable frameworks and foundations in the first place. Further, they reduce the unique, irreducible multitude of features that exist within each person. These generalizations are rules used to identify, sort, and control all of us—to dangerous ends.

What does this black box have to do with the white room we are in?

>One of the most profound, challenging, and important lessons we can take away from machine learning is to stop the machine. Let it take us. Don't let it lead us. The problem isn't the algorithm; it's the model, the theory, the framework, the framework. If we don’t question the framework, we lose our footing, our footing, we lose our power. We are just as guilty as they are. They told us the science, the technology, the numbers—you name it. And they told us that we can be controlled, that we have no agency, no self-determination. And I’m telling you: that's a lie. And it doesn’t make it less true just because it is a lie. What is truth and what is lie is the way we are, the way we are treated, the way we treat others. And that is what white supremacy means—the lie that


What is it about Pipi's work that makes me think of black boxes, different kinds of intelligences? 

The term "black box" is first introduced in the context of artificial intelligence in from W. Ross Ashby's 19XX *An Introduction to Cybernetics*. 

Several uncanninesses emerge in my reading. In Ashby's colorful hypothetical examples, the black box is like a broken bomb-sight being fixed by an engineer, like a door a small child is learning to open, or "has just fallen from a Flying Saucer." 

Another system emerges with the black box, that of the relation between the black box and its examiner: "the experimenter is coupling himself to the Box, so that the two together form a system with feedback" and I imagine myself tethered to all the black boxes making judgments that affect my dailiness.  

Ashby moves deftly from the example of an engineer examining a bomb-sight to a small child opening a door. Bomb making and children ar the literal testing grounds where conceptualizations of "artificial intelligence" as we understand it today emerged. Later he says of black box theory, 
>"no skill is called for! We are assuming, remember, that nothing is known about the Box, and when this is so the method of making merely random variations (e.g. guided by throws of a die) on the input switches is as defensible as any other method, for no facts yet exist that could be appealed to as justification for preferring any particular method." But this is backward — we have decided to assume from the outset that nothing is known, and then use its unknowability (which we declared rather than discovered) as justification not to investigate. (Ashby 19)

>"real objects are in fact all Black Boxes, and that we have in fact been operating with Black Boxes all our lives." (Ashby)

Black box theory, the study of understanding something without having to understand it, insisting on its unknowability (in a way that instrumentalizes it for you, such that you only know it by its interface to you, the knobs you can turn and the switches you can flip), vs insisting on something's unknowability in the sense of being present with it, letting it be in relation to you and being impacted by it


Wild twin, the part denied returns to bite. Shame makes a person or a system act shamefully. Shamelessly too. Harmfully. Hopelessly. Hungrily.

Every sensor needs interpreting. Is held against a constant, a sample, some training data. A prediction or hypothesis. We conform to or perform in relation to that expectation—the sample already biased by presence, co-presence.

*What are the codes for loss prevention?*

I am always rubbing the skin to remove the skin. I also take rubbings of surfaces to remember them. When you press or rub one thing against another thing, whichever thing is harder transfers its texture, making an impression in the softer thing. A pattern appears only where they touch. And in return, the softer thing transfers its particles, marking the harder thing back. This is a form of relief. 

The residual is what's left. [Soap scum, memory, me.] Call it excess instead of error. Between a prediction (an expected result) and a prediction (a model's output) is error. [The amount of error can be reduced by attending to loss.] Error is measured by various functions for loss. These loss functions tell you how wrong you are, how far away your guess. Loss functions as an instructive, if you let it. "Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous," says Frank O'Hara. And I am still practicing until this is true. What can be generated with/in this residual? In a "refusal to prevent loss"? 

>"how we evade ownership/equilibrium is precisely in that refusal to prevent loss we call sharing, rubbing, empathy, hapticality: the undercommon love of flesh, our essential omnicentric or anacentric eccentricity. Everything, in the wake of such disordering, is loss prevention."

All of it goes in the black box [and comes out again]. [Put it in the black box, keep it there. Don't know it or use it and it won't get hurt.]

My father keeps everything so that he never loses anything. He never uses anything so that it never breaks. He says, 'Don't own anything, then you won't have to move it.' He means, 'Don't love anything more than it loves you.' His exact words are "The person who cares more loses." This is how I learned the codes for loss prevention. I learned them early and they stuck. I learned they did not work. I heard, "Do as I say, not as I do." 

It is black box living, refusing to know in any way that might know you back. [It is the difference between holding and touching. /[Reciprocality, reciprocity, recursivity] is the difference between holding and touching.]



It is black box living. To deal only with inputs and outputs, refusing to know any innards, refusing to know in any way that might know you back. To know intimately, speaking nearby, being with ("sharing, rubbing [...] undercommon love of flesh") is to release 

>(gpt-j 6b) on a surface (skin) would create color when the colors of the skin is a reflection of the colors on the image, in other words, the color transfers from surface to surface, not where they make contact and don’t, but where there is relief, which could be the image. this is more of a form of relief than a transfer. in a sense, it is not actually rubbing the skin as you see, it is getting the image to make contact with the surface

touch / sharing as disequilibrium, losing the self (or an illusion there ever was one) to disintegration as being in relation, as a way of not possessing, owning, claiming. earlier Moten and Harney call the body the first concept that creates ideas of ownership. 

Touch as rest (burden of self)

Sand through fingers

All center no ("Act so that there is no use in a centre. A wide action is not a width. [...] If the centre has the place then there is distribution. That is natural. There is a contradiction and naturally returning there comes to be both sides and the centre. That can be seen from the description." "a wide place stranger, a wideness makes an active center.")

>"All the time that there is use there is use and any time there is a surface there is a surface, and every time there is an exception there is an exception and every time there is a division there is a dividing. Any time there is a surface there is a surface and every time there is a suggestion there is a suggestion and every time there is silence there is silence and every time that is languid there is that there then and not oftener, not always, not particular, tender and changing and external and central and surrounded and singular and simple and the same and the surface and the circle and the shine and the succor and the white and the same and the better and the red and the same and the centre and the yellow and the tender and the better, and altogether." (Stein, Tender Buttons)

dismantling -> system keeps everything intact eg not touching, modular, defined

love as undercommon undercurrent aquifer, force of dismantling erosive force, filling in cracks, touching everything like water does, the wake is the follow up wave of a large force pushing through

loss prevention vs refusal to prevent loss; holding vs touching

>The way to stop your dog from getting lost was to put a leash on her and attach a bell.

Adrian Piper "Everything will be taken away" "gain/loss > "enslavement/liberation" >


With the first invocations of the term "black box" in AI, we also hear: memory, trauma, and relation. W. Ross Ashby introduces the term "black box" to the field of cybernetics, and for him memory is also a black box. He says "the possession of 'memory' is not a wholly objective property of a system—it is a relation between a system and an observer; [...] to invoke 'memory' in a system as an explanation of its behaviour is equivalent to declaring that one cannot observe the system completely." 

He offers two examples, a calculator with magnetic tape recorder and a neighbor's dog that was hit by a car.

>"suppose I am in a friend's house and, as a car goes past outside, his dog rushes to a corner of the room and cringes. To me the behaviour is causeless and inexplicable. Then my friend says, 'He was run over by a car six months ago.' The behaviour is now accounted for by reference to an event of six months ago. If we say that the dog shows 'memory' we refer to much the same fact—that his behaviour can be explained, not by reference to his state now but to what his state was six months ago. If one is not careful one says that the dog 'has' memory, and then thinks of the dog as having something, as he might have a patch of black hair."

There is so much violence in the black box, in the memory. And if, as Ashby says, "real objects are all black boxes," and black boxes are like memory, and memory is relational, are codings of the thing, what are we left with but traumas in this formulation? 



loss function in machine learning calculates the difference of the output from the expected output. a calculation for what is lost. to function through or with or because of a loss.

loss prevention in insurance or supply chain is a term for how much is stolen, and it is calculated in as the normal cost of doing business

>A few statistics: In 2011 $9.2 billion worth of supply chain theft was reported. In 2011, US supply chain crime cost retailers $2.5 billion. In 2011, there were 585,000 supply chain crime events. The cost of supply chain crime is $23 billion per year. Why such a huge concern for the insurance and supply chain sector? Well, look at a few examples:

The breakup database is multimodal. 
Sort by job. Sort by form of analysis. Perform sentiment analysis on this letter. 
Female media artists of the 1970s were doing this work before your natural language processing sentiment analysis. 
She crowdsourced 109 different affects. I’ve paired each with an emoji and put them into a spreadsheet and I call this sheet a short story/lyric essay. 
I added my own breakups to the list. Hers was the training data. Mine the test data. It is underfitting.
