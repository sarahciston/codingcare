## 0. Overview

Consisting of new datasets, new models, and new technical and artistic practices, this project lays out alternative approaches to text-based machine learning that center marginalized experiences. ‚ÄúA Queer Love Corpus,‚Äù is its pilot dataset for developing intersectional approaches to conscientious dataset stewardship.

## üî• what's the problem? 
## *Giant machine learning tools grab data indiscriminately*
### Despite their totalizing approach, they still do a terrible job telling stories about people who don't fit their normalizing baselines.

- The size of these models means they pull in racist text, inaccurate text, private text, and other kinds of problematic text.
- The size of these models prevents their review and adjustment. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop criteria by which they should be reviewed or adjusted, ostensibly because they are intended for "general" "all-purpose" tasks.
- The size of these models prevents many individuals from using them except as designed by large companies. Understanding, customizing, and using them in unique ways requires high technical expertise and financial overhead.
- The size of these models enacts a totalizing approach that‚Äîrather than representing a multitude of voices, centers, normalizes‚Äîand affirms a powerful status quo while leaving out the experiences of many others even as they capture our data.


<!-- >>Problem sentence<< -->

### The solution is NOT to suck up more data carelessly!

### So how do we address this care-fully?

>>Research question<<

Rather than ineffective solutions that superficially address bias by trying to "optimize" existing systems, and rather than dismissing their potential entirely, let's reimagine large language models and large-scale machine learning from their foundational principles in order to achieve different goals--such as curated, accessible, tangible tools suited to their users and caring for their subjects; tools designed to take into account their contexts and to incorporate intersectional values.


## why does this matter?

## who does it impact?

## how to address it?

## where are more details? 


#### 1.1.1 how it works now

**TRANSFORMERS**

When predicting what words will most likely follow the word '*bank*', should the ML system expect '*money*' or '*river*'? Depending on what texts have trained the model, if the system almost always expects *money*, the opportunities to encounter *rivers* disappear. 

This example comes from a tutorial on transformers [@rasaRasaAlgorithmWhiteboard2020](), a type of machine learning model commonly used for training with large language datasets for machine learning. It was presented as a neutral example, but it is instructive not only for describing the operation of these systems on a technical level but for showing how they pit economic value versus other values, such as ecology and poetics. Fredric Kaplan calls this "linguistic capitalism" [@kaplanLinguisticCapitalismAlgorithmic2014](), and describes how its technical mechanisms shrink the possibilities for what can be searched, spoken, and known.

Each moment where a decision is made to chose *money* over *river* is miniscule, a microgesture made by numerical weights. Individually, each can be reasoned away. But in aggregate, these decisions make huge impacts.

**SCALE & SCRAPING**

Whether curating a small collection, or scraping from the web indiscriminately, gathering and selecting sources for texts enacts the cultural standards of its creators. Selection presents a point of view. Acknowledging and accounting for this counteracts the pervasive assumption that the totalizing approaches of large language model datasets "neutralize" this issue, when in fact they highlight the Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic (WEIRD) culture from which they emerge. 

**ORIGINS & LEGACIES**

Models are built on top of other models, datasets are built as compendia of other datasets. In current industry practice, a new model's performance is measured by its adherence to standardized benchmark datasets. These originating, foundational tools often go unquestioned when building upon them. ChatGPT trains on top of GPT-3 and combines it with a new dataset of prompts. [XXXXX] trains on [XXXXXXX], which is trained on ImageNet. But what happens when ImageNet or the 

How the [XXX] Brown Corpus, etc. leads to WordNet leads to ImageNet ([Crawford 2021]()), how even when the "problematic" terms are removed, the system continues to operate in flawed ways



- It relies on flawed logics of bias and classification from its fundamental structures.
- It is is designed to operate without any one part. ([Amoore]())
- It persists/perpetuates and amplifies and creates the cultural systems. ([]())

>"This clustering of aesthetic information and stereotypes is at the heart of AI image generation systems. This is true whether we are asking for pictures of flowers (a generalization of all flowers) or butterflies (a generalization, a stereotype, of all butterflies.) But it raises unique questions about removing harmful representational biases. How do you remove real Sumatrans from Sumatraism? [...] We might say the ‚Äúgenre‚Äù of these style markers are haunted by images of similarly associated ideas. A category of information containing a set of harmless style effects can, it seems, contain residues of whatever those lingering tropes were used to depict."

Ramon Amaro: *The Black Technical Object*


>"While we need not give up on the radical potential of queerness as a means of imagining a future that is not yet here (Mu√±oz 2009), we must nonetheless acknowledge how futurity has been colonized by the cultural logic of contemporary technology, and as such cannot serve as the primary vector for queer computational critique. Thus, rather than mobilize queerness as a useful technological apparatus, we might deploy it as part of a critical practice of unmaking." (Gaboury 2018, "Critical Unmaking: Towards a Queer Computation", 488)

>"I am meeting a socially generated problem of technological inadequacy with a critical, technical inadequacy of my own, answering their flaw with a counter-flaw of equal proportion. It‚Äôs a class aesthetic." (Triton Mobley, BOMB interview, 2022)

#### DATASET DESIGN 

Many existing text corpuses, which are the datasets to train large language models for machine learning tasks (e.g. GPT-3/ChatGPT text generation), have very little information about the origins of their texts included either in their documentation or in the datasets themselves. For example, "The Pile" is a mega-dataset made of other already enormous datasets, designed for very large language model training. Its schema consists of two simple entries, the `text` itself and the `source` of the text. However, to call this a source is misleading, because the source field simply points back to the originating dataset, like [Common Crawl Corpus or Books2 or WebText](). These also giant datasets do not offer any more information about the journey this text took to arrive in this corpus, who authored it or when, what it might contain. 

As Tara McPherson says, "The database depends on the loss of the thing itself. At one level, this loss is literal, as the 'thing'‚Äîsay a photo or film‚Äîis digitized and transformed into data. At another level, this loss is also a key aspect of the functioning of the technology." 

**No data cards** @gebruDatasheetsDatasets2020


**SAMPLE ENTRY FROM [THE PILE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/the_pile/viewer/all/train)**

```JSON
{ 
    "text": "Topic: reinvent midnight madness Amazon announced a new service at the AWS re:Invent Midnight Madness event. Amazon Sumerian is a solution that aims to make it easier for developers to build virtual reality, augmented reality, and 3D applications.

    "meta": 
        { "pile_set_name": "Pile-CC" }
}
```

Many of the datasets which go into the larger Pile dataset do not themselves have separated metadata, each only has a text field or incidental information. 

**SAMPLE ENTRY FROM [COMMON CRAWL CORPUS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snoop2head/common_crawl)**

```JSON
{
    "text": "The Marine Corps makes you buy the sword. That always bothered me. Eight hundred dollars for a fancy-looking but dull blade that I only used once for a sword arch at a buddy‚Äôs wedding. But, on Jan. 6, 2021, as I took my sword from its display case on the wall of my congressional office, it seemed like the most practical weapon with which I could defend myself, if it came to that."
}
```

**SAMPLE ENTRY FROM [BOOKS2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/the_pile_books3/viewer/plain_text/train)**

```JSON
{ 
    "title": "7 Secrets to an Awesome Marriage",
    "text": "" \nSome authors write about the \"latest secret\" to lasting love, but in this book Kim shares how "(...TRUNCATED)
}
```

**SAMPLE ENTRY FROM [OPENWEBTEXT2](https://openwebtext2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

Some datasets do provide a bit more context for their source texts, such as OpenWebText2, which is an open-source recreation of the proprietary version used to develop GPT-2/3. We cannot assume that the closed version created by OpenAI has this context, and regardless it remains unavailable to researchers or members of the public. Below is an example of one of its 17 million entries, which includes additional fields like the source URL, title, subreddit it appears in, and Reddit "Karma Score" (which was used by OpenAI to filter for viable entries)(more on this in **Section 1.1.1**).  

```JSON
{
        "text": "A shutdown to contain the coronavirus has killed Thailand‚Äôs party scene and forced sex workers like Pim out of bars and onto desolate streets. She‚Äôs scared but desperately needs customers to pay her rent.\n\nRed-light districts from Bangkok to Pattaya have gone quiet with night clubs and massage parlors closed and tourists blocked from entering the country.\n\nThat has left an estimated 300,000 sex workers out of a job, pressing some onto the streets where the risks are sharpened by the pandemic.\n\n 
        (...TRUNCATED)

            ],
            "reddit_scores": [

            ],
            "reddit_titles": [

            ]
        }
    }
```

Alternatively, here is a proposed entry for A Queer Love Corpus, with metadata and contextual fields for not only the source of the text data but also how it was contributed and processed, what permissions were provided, and why its contributor finds it relevant to the dataset. 

This approach combines curation practices from information sciences with dataset creation practices to better account for data donation and informed consent, traceable attribution, and granular control for custom datasets. It also allows the dataset to be used as an archive, explorable and extensible in its own right.

Whether used to create text-to-image models, like Stable Diffusion or Dalle-2, or Swiss Army knife language models, like Galactica, or whether wrapping them in conversational agents, like ChatGPT‚Äî‚Äîthe systems all rely on similar foundational models, datasets, and architectures that are designed with similar approaches and goals in mind.
