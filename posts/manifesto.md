#### manifesto for coding.care

Whereas coding has been considered the province of too few for too long. 
Whereas the rest have been treated as outsiders to the systems that consume us.
Whereas care and compassion are

We know that sneaky feeling an idea should already exist means we might be the ones who are meant to create it. We know that other sneaky feeling that an idea is too impossibly far-fetched, that we are the only ones who would want it, *still* means we are the ones who should pursue it. We are the ones who can bring our vision to life. 

We break code to learn how it works, to see if it could work a different way, to see if its not working makes it sing out with poetry. We write it out on paper if we don't know how to say it with code. 

When the tool we need doesn't exist, we build it. We make it from the existing tools we scraped for parts. We build it with duct tape and spit and the new programming language we teach ourselves along the way. 

We build it to prove to ourselves that it can exist. We build it as an offering for others to share. We build it to prove that building is for anyone, instruction manuals for hope. 

[...]

If it doesn't exist, we ask if it should. And if it does exist, we still ask if it should (or shouldn't). We ask how could it be otherwise. All making is a research question. All theory is theory–practice. All practice is theory–practice. Which is to say, our reading and thinking saturates what creative choices we make, what materials we use, how we speak about what we do. This is true even if unconscious. And so we choose to acknowledge this and do so mindfully. || Our creative choices and materials and our work in our bodies saturates our reading and thinking, our vocabularies, our points of reference, our critical tools, our communities of practice. These are recursive and reciprocal and iterative. Making is always a research question about how to live.

When we can't find a tutorial, we don't assume it can't be done. We don't assume it isn't meant to be done. We don't say, "That's not what code is for." Instead we try asking with new language, asking a friend with a different background, asking with our hands in the dirt, asking as we tinkering on another project in another medium, until answers circle back to us. We write it out on paper, we draw it, we sing it, we take a dance break. Persistence is a rhythm not a slog.

We reverse-engineer, run it backwards, learn from others' examples and apply, combine, modify them liberally. We pull from anywhere, [interdisciplinary, intersectional practice.]

[...]

We make coded things in order to connect with others, to bridge the ephemeral spark gaps of language and feeling and being separate creatures trying to reach each other. We make things hoping someone thinks they're kind of cool. 

We write code in order to decode the systems that ...

We will not be outsiders in the systems that injure us.
