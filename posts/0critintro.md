# Trans*formative TechnoCraft

To build safer, more

## Creative–Critical–Care Entanglements

Trans*formative TechnoCraft argues for the essential entanglement of critical AI and creative-critical coding communities, showing how each is predicated on the other. No intervention in disproportionately harmful algorithmic systems is possible without critically aware approaches to technologies from deeply plural perspectives. No such proliferation of perspectives is possible without inviting spaces to understand, interrogate, and reimagine the infrastructures that support those systems. 

>"Anyone who has ever woven or knitted knows that one can change patterns [...] but, more importantly, they know *there are other patterns*. The web of technology can indeed be woven differently, but even to discuss such intentional changes of pattern requires an examination of the features of the current pattern and an understanding of the origins and the purpose of the present design." 
>>—Ursula M. Franklin ([@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004])

Yet, how do we participate on our own terms, in order to change systems to suit us? Especially when <span class="purple">learning programming is so often intimidating and riddled with false starts,</span> which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. 

### We Need Intersectional Critical AI 

>"I’m stuck here inputting and outputting the data of a story I can’t change." 
>>(Italo Calvino "The Burning of the Abominable House" 1976, trans. 1995)

With every hype, the anti-hype: 

>"Questions like 'is a computer creative' or 'is a computer an artist' or the like should not be considered serious questions, period. In the light of the problems we are facing at the end of the 20th century, those are irrelevant questions. Computers can and should be used in art in order to draw attention to new circumstances and connections and to forget 'art'." 
>>(Frieder Nake 1971) 

Questions about art, creativity, and labor in relation to AI are fundamentally questions trying to define humanity — *What makes us creative or empathetic? What makes us different from machines? What makes us human?* They are old, old questions. They also emerge from centuries of colonialized framings of 'man' as an idealized, individual white western subject. Hyped AI discourse explores limited questions about AI because it continues to draw from limited perspectives, letting status quo narratives about humans and automated systems frame the terms of debate. 

AI hype describes machine learning systems as impenetrable black boxes. It designs the interfaces with which we engage its tools, it claims the proprietary restrictions that hide its data (our data), and it influences the regulations that keep its power in the hands of a select few. We only break out of those boxes when we refuse to engage on those terms. 

>Kate Crawford argues that computational "ways of seeing depend on the twin moves of abstraction and extraction. But these logics can be challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected."

Automated decision-making systems disproportionately harm the marginalized majority. We are subject to it whenever we lend our data by clicking terms of service pop-ups to make them go away and whenever we must be recognized by borders, banks, and bureaucracies of any kind. Our vulnerability in these moments is exploited and profited on — from testing biometric facial technologies in refugee camps [@neddenBiometrieGetestetMillionen2017] to reinforcement learning reliant on AI chatbot user responses. Many amazing researchers have highlighted the increasing impacts of AI systems and surveillance capitalism [footnote cite Browne, Gebru, et al]. 

The task of Critical AI researchers and makers is to engage these systems as sociotechncial objects embedded in their historical, social, context. We must be "situated in proximity to the thing itself, cultivating some degree of participatory and embodied expertise, whether archival, ethnographic, or applied (Raley & Rhee, 2022 [@raleyCriticalAIField2023]). This requires interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives. 

Kimberlé Crenshaw's iconic analysis of power, called Intersectionality,[@crenshawDemarginalizingIntersectionRace1989] "critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally." [@cooperIntersectionality2016] 

Intersectionality can reveal the human costs of finding ourselves caught within these algorithmic systems – their proliferating data and supporting material infrastructures, as well as their consolidating power and supporting sociocultural infrastructures. Their power is differential by design. Conversations about AI fairness, transparency, explainability, ethics, public good, and the various hype cycles of each new technology are grossly incomplete without intersectional analyses of power and intersectional tactics of (and beyond) equity and inclusion. No change *about* us *without* us. 

As industry implementations of so-called intersectional tech reduce these complex concepts into flattened ideas of fairness and representation [@ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a], we need multimodal, polyvocal, experimental approaches that cut through the technological solutionism. [@cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019] 

>"We must begin with the knowledge that new technologies will not simply redistribute power equitably within already established hierarchies of difference. The idea that they will is the stuff of utopian naivete and technological determinism that got us here to begin with. The Broken Machine should not be understood as a new technology. It is not an upgrade to an older model or a feminist design solution." [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020]

### We Need Creative–Critical–Caring Approaches 

How do we reconnect the communities of practice who are building technologies and those who are equipped with the knowledge to consider its most urgent questions? 

Caring, creative, and critical approaches must be combined in order to adapt the spaces where technologies are discussed, designed, and implemented. Those spaces are missing the essential perspective of those most at the margins, who are most capable of addressing the urgent issues facing technology. These concerns are not new, nor strictly digital. They have been addressed by a wide range of communities with different types of knowledge for centuries. Many are calling for that knowledge to be applied here. [cite][indigenous, queer, other applications of AI]

Yet intimidating, isolating cultures around the specialization of computation and programming practices have left so many of us out of these conversations. [cite][Vee, Abbate, Hicks] 

How do we reunite? 

We need access. We need our contributions to be valued, for the effort toward understanding to be mutual because all participants know we all have important contributions to make. 

Access includes many aspects. It requires connecting an individual's current understanding and circumstances to the [item in question]. It considers like material, financial, intellectual, social resources that allow entry points. 

I may be capable of understanding how a machine learning system works, but not have the prerequisite vocabulary to enter a conversation in order to learn about it. 

I may understand how to operate a machine learning system, but not have the financial resources needed to run a resource-intensive devices in order to use one.

I may have knowledge and resources to share, but not be able to participate because barrier-free access, transcription, gender-inclusive language, or other inclusive aspects were not prioritized by the organizers. 



>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public." 
>>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

These works are written as jargon-free as possible to allow them to travel as broadly as possible. While 

#### Creative-critical-code: holistic approaches

Care means critical.

All writing is a hybrid practice of creation (poetics), critique (politics), and code (platforms and programmatic systems). All code is writing and all writing is code. 

>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public."

>"By reinforcing the idea that there is a split between theory and practice or by creating such a split, both groups [elite academia and anti-intellectuals] deny the power of liberatory education for critical consciousness, thereby perpetuating conditions that reinforce our collective exploitation and repression.
>>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

>"Theory is not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. lt fulfills this function only when we ask that it do so and direct our theorizing towards this end." >>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]


It requires we reunite the divisions between theory and practice, between user and programmer, which were artificially split from the start. [XXXexplain] [^hoff] [^nardi] [^americanartist] It requires un-siloing of domains and disciplines, the artificial boundaries that divide technologists from activists. 

It requires we find common language, common value/appreciation/respect that comes with working knowledge of the whole working system. 

**The technical means how (coding skills) and the critical/analytical means how (analytical, political, aesthetic, ethical contexts) and the material means how (data, energy, hardware) have to combine / are inseparable.**

#### Approachable, accessible // Care means access


#### Research tensions

To sit a bit longer with questions I know I cannot answer, questions that make me uneasy. To hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously and let their magnetic energy push-pull me. To forgive myself the imperative outcomes, the productivity, the proven hypothesis, the subject of research. To put myself into the trouble too, because I already embody these questions in lived experience.

#### Artistic experimentation

>"Bots can make arguments. [...] Bots are a strategy deployed in particular circumstances, and they are frequently deployed as a folk practice, outside of 'mainstream' practices of artists, academics, researchers, engineers, etc. [...] bots are a way of working against the accepted uses or potentially damaging affordances of a particular platform. bots are a way of embodying certain kinds of unauthorized and semi-authorized uses of those spaces. [...] bots exist to shine a light on how things already work, but also to test the edge cases, and to propose alternatives. [...] bots are procedures against procedures." -Allison Parrish, "Procedure vs Procedure"

The case for combining creative and critical practices is already strong, and has been made elsewhere by many [XXXexpand][cite]. I am interested in how this work shows up as experimentation and particularly in how artistic experiments can challenge paradigms in machine learning, data science, and technology more broadly. 

I have found artistic research practices can interrogate systems and imagine new ones. For me, it combines rigorous scholarly investigation, deep community building and activism, and creative play in ways that can connect to broader non-academic audiences. 

Art has been the space where I’m able to unpack complex ideas for myself, because I can treat them more freely as artistic materials. It’s where I’m able to follow instinct and feel into how my tools, platforms, and forms shape their outputs and outcomes. 

It’s also the space where I feel able to imagine wildly, creating digital objects that should exist but don’t, or couldn’t exist but might. In my experience, this imaginative work is central to supporting very practical next steps and strategies. It is central to supporting more open access to communities of practice where others can continue the kinds of artistic experimentation that challenge paradigms in new forms I might never imagine.
 
This is a practice of artistic research, research-creation, and/or arts-based research (different lineages and regions call it by different names)[cite] [@lovelessHowMakeArt2019]. 

>"Arts-based research recognises the diversity of methods appropriate to research; the plurality of objects of study; and the array of values associated with these diverse research methods and objects." [@willisFastForwardFuture2016]

>"Specifically the "valences" of research-creation [Chapman & Sawchuk] that are not "creative presentation of research" (reporting on research in creative ways), or "research for creation" that supports a stand-alone artwork, or "research from creation" (reporting about artworks after the fact), but rather "creation-as-research" [and I'd add research-as-creation], which Loveless says "Research-creation [...] produces hybrid forms, defamiliarizing and uncanny, that oscillate between more than one 'species' of production and that result in 'offspring' that are often unthinkable, illegible within the current institutional frameworks of academia. It creates a chimera. By bringing research and creation together in such a way that they unpredictably contaminate and remake each other,"

>"in failing to fully belong, and allowing that nonbelonging to denaturalize, emergently, its givens, research-creation tells other stories, uncanny stories, that (have the potential to) carry within them the other ethics that King invites us to attend to."


>"The experience of artists reinforces a point we have each separately argued elsewhere: that abstract ethics conversations are a necessary but not sufficient condition for progressive politics around digital technologies and that everyday digital practice is the terrain around which broader ethical and political ends must be staked out." (Stark & Crawford 2019, 452)
>"artists saw value in reaching shared normative practices through engagement between artists and audiences, suggesting a model for participation and collaboration often missing in other forms of digital research and development.(Stark & Crawford 2019, 45 [@starkWorkArtAge2019]

#### These approaches are entangled

Dunbar-Hester and others call for interventions that go deeper than training more people in tech jobs, pointing out that this does little to examine the structures that organize and value work sectors out of balance. She argues this calls for
>"a larger reevaluation and appropriation of categories themselves—the boundaries of what is 'social' and what is 'technical' are flexible categories" @dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019
>"Voluntaristic technology communities are important sites because they are utopian spaces where people play and tinker not only with technical artifacts but with social reality, imagining social relations through participation"

DH: not about diversity in tech directly, aim at broader social goals of [e.g. decolonization, ecological sustainability, distribution of wealth] which would necessitate changes in tech sector.

## What Is Trans\*formative TechnoCraft?

### Trans\*formative

Trans\*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It means process-oriented, community-oriented practices. It means making space for and honoring what we figure out as we go along, [adjusting and tailoring to the needs and goals of our specific situations as we operate in community]. 

'Transformative' includes transformative justice, which recognizes that oppressive systems are at the root of technological harms. It argues that acknowledging systemic oppression is essential to addressing those harms and shifting away from carceral logics and toward healing systems. Transformative justice seeks repair beyond punishment, focusing not only on remedying wrongs but more broadly on instituting infrastructures of care and reorienting the values embedded within technical objects and practices.[cite][^reparative] It is not just a question of what bias to remove from technology, but of what to build in its place.

>"From the design to the production to the deployment to the outcome, there is constantly bias built in. It's not just the biases of the people themselves; it’s the inherent bias within the system. There's so many points of influence that, quite frankly, our fight is not for cleaning up the data. Our fight is not for an unbiased algorithm, because we don't believe that even mathematically, there could be an unbiased algorithm for policing at all." [...] "The goal is always to be building power toward abolition of these programs, because you can’t reform them. There is no such thing as kinder, gentler racism, and these programs have to be dismantled." (Hamid Khan interviewed in @ryan-mosleyActivistDismantlingRacist2020) 

[^reparative]: Reparative and restorative processing are part of this work, but the terms 'reparative' and 'restorative' in relationship to justice movements and to LGBTQIA+ histories are fraught. Instead I find the broader sense of 'transformative' resonates for me with trans\*, intersectional, and inclusive approaches to identities and [politics][— as well as to this project, its participants, its influences, and its intentions]. 

<!-- "politics of creation, prefigurative politics" -->

Trans\*formative is an active, prefigurative[footnote] stance. It brings `programming` closer to its synonym `processing`, combining computational practices with emotional ones, digital with digestive. Trans\*formative processing refers both to processing units (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs) and also to processing personal, communal, and generational trauma. It means both works-in-progress and algorithmic processes. Ongoing processing not fixed programmed states. Let's inspect further...

[^prefigurative]: `Prefigurative` just means embodying our values, making it "a daily endeavor of creating the world we want." and "our actions create the world we want right now, we don’t have to wait for the revolution to start another, better world." [@bransonPracticalAnarchismGuide2022].

>>"Revolutionary movements require a teleological pool from which to draw. The imagination is that teleological pool: it not only creates liberatory drives; it sustains, justifies and legitimises them. It undoes entire epistemes and clears a space for us to create something new. Though this 'newness', or the demand for something else, can never fully be realised in the realm of the discursive, it exists in other registers: it can be felt, heard, touched, tasted. The structural limits of this world restrict our ability to articulate all that the imagination is capable of conceiving. Do not forget this." [@olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021]

#### Transformers

Transformers are a current type of machine learning architecture being employed to create large models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.[^techterms] They are good at digesting large clumps of text, images, video — all interpreted as numbers — and reconstituting them. Transformers main parts are called encoders and decoders, and it's often said that even their designers don't know what exactly is going on in these hidden layers. We can discuss the specifics of that elsewhere (see Interstitial: Codes for Un/Knowing). I find it more interesting that the *transformers themselves* do not know what is going on in these hidden layers of the own architecture — despite all the anthropomorphizing of AI systems, with widespread use of terms like "learning" and "understanding." While they process and produce meaning (input and output), transformers are never "aware" of the meaning of the content they are processing along the way. They are just crunching numbers.

Transformers are the latest, but won't be the last, in a long string of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees[^techterms] to submit to their "superior" logics. With every iteration on their forms, we repeat their hype but lose trace of their histories in "race science" and colonizing power that captures what it means to know and be known. [@browneDarkMattersSurveillance2015, @benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019, @joqueRevolutionaryMathematicsArtificial2022]

The paper that launched a thousand transformer models was called "Attention Is All You Need." Transformer language models incorporate text context through a mechanism called "self-attention" that examines a selection of word-units surrounding each word-unit they interpret. [@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023] As they proceed, they use this interpretation to predict the next most likely word to appear in a sentence, based on the words that have commonly appeared near the last few words before. 

But we need more than self-attention. We need self-reflection and co-regulation. We need systems that, in their very architectures, celebrate difference - rather than erase it.  

<!-- each of these para could be expanded. in critAI-genAI paper? -->

[^techterms]: For more explanation of terms, see "A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" and "Intersectional AI Toolkit."

#### Trans\*

To move from the "transformer" model architecture to trans\*formative tech (and from tech to technocraft) means to acknowledge the requisite entanglement of community building and [critical sociotechnical systems]. It means knowing the material we are transforming — by sharing in, speaking nearby, walking beside, being constituted and supported by, and supporting in turn.

This work is about trans\*formation through trans\*lation and trans\*disciplinarity[^transdis] and trans\*gression.[^hooksTransgress] It lays the groundwork to imagine trans\*formers otherwise, to imagine [emergent/co-existing technological systems] at a slant, on the bias rather than always-already biased. It calls for queerer systems (queer as a politics, as in fuck you, as in QueerOS, as in queer-enough).[@dogparkdissidentsQueerFuckYou, @keelingQueerOS2014] 

[^transdis]: Trans\*disciplinary includes multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary — across and combined and between — plus what emerges when those diffractions become more than the sum of their parts. [@visResearchPeopleWho2021]

[^hooksTransgress]: As in "teaching that enables transgressions – a movement against and beyond boundaries." [@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

>"queer as [in] being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent, create and find a place to speak, and to thrive and to live"
>>—bell hooks

This approach to technological trans\*lation and trans\*formation has no prerequisites. We are already queer-enough, coder-enough, valued-enough to participate in continually becoming. We are "always-already programming."[@AlwaysalreadyprogrammingMd] (See "Coding.Care")

Trans\* can be inclusive, fluid, in motion, outside binary logics, self-identifying, evolving, emergent, embodied. *Trans\*formative TechnoCraft* imagines systems that can also have these qualities, that can trans\*cend the logics constructed by capitalist, militaristic, racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages. 

>"queerness is itself inherent within [the history of] computational logic, [...yet] there exists a structuring logic to computational systems that, while nearly totalizing, does not account for all forms of knowledge, and which excludes certain acts, behaviors, and modes of being." [@gabouryQueerHistoryComputing2013d]

(See also trans\*feminist and crip technosciences below)

Trans\* also finds queer reverberations in the transducers all around us that constitute and reinforce computational systems. A transducer (from Latin for `lead across`) converts physical signals into electrical signals, or vice versa. Trans\*ducers are intermediaries that allow the trans\*fer between analogue to digital. Every time information gets trans\*mitted from an environmental sensor to a digital device — sound waves into audio files, pressure into heart rate [XXX,example] — trans\*duction has occurred, and thus some kind of trans\*formation. (Note how many times trans\*-ness appears in sites of cybernetic knowing.) These reimaginings of information's forms are always interventions, informed by the device designers' decisions as well as both contemporary and historical approaches to computational knowing. The material conversions required to power the logics of computation (turning qualities into voltages into quantities) all pass through gates of trans\* thinking. 

#### \*

The `*` after `trans` longs for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming, and as such can include anyone who wonders if they belong, who wonders what they contribute, who wonders what "this whole thing" is about (be it gender, sexuality, technology, whatever). 

Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial. It is a footnote that defines our terms, and also it is the invitation to extend beyond any definition given. 

The asterisk is a perturbation, a pebble in the shoe. In the German language, the gendering of nouns and verbs is haphazardly addressed by an asterisk that breaks the word, introduces a glottal stop between its 'masculine' and 'feminine' formations. `Student` or `Studentin` becomes `Student*in`; `Bäcker` or `Bäckerin` becomes `Bäcker*in`. This brief interruption can be read as a faulty solution that maintains gender-as-binary, it's true. And also, this hesitation adds a frequent awkwardness that highlights how often conversation is about gender unnecessarily. It physically opens up a space (in the mouth) where gender is unknown/unstable/all. 

A French or English apostrophe may mark an omission of letters, but this elision also joins together, suturing up the distance it creates. The asterisk shares this tension here, as a clot that heals, an unspeakable but audible gasp. 

Like the apostrophe at the start of `'pataphysics`, which gestures to the absurdity from which it springs, the asterisk is the instigator and the multiplier, the pivot and the punctum and the portal.

It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations, abstracted away. It's not a redaction which the asterisk marks, but the possibilities of unknown language underneath. Or the tension of knowing and not saying, as in the marking of sw*@\r words. [Again, queer as a politics, "queer as in fuck you."] 

The asterisk is risk (just a step), is starry-eyed, A-star pathfinding, ASCII joy, a wry smile, and a mark of possibility on a treasure map. In mathematics the asterisk is duality, mirrors mirroring each other, points connecting to make lines and lines crossing to make points, weak-star topologies and infinite vector space. This returns us to the word vectors and latent spaces of transformers.[CITEMiller] 

And all this comes back to nearness and distance, how similarity and difference are mapped onto nearness and distance. What if the polarities were reversed — nearness and difference, similarity and distance? What if different values could rule instead of only matching like with like? How about all other intuitions that bring us together, including but not only what make us the same? 
~~What about activation functions that put these on XY axes and tamper with the expectations/intuitions?~~

The \* emphasizes an unspoken interstitial — interjection, interruption, insertion, interpolation — this work happening in between and nearby, underneath and overhead and throughout. [Here's a brief interstitial...] In digital contexts this may be called [`lerp`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp) or [`tween`](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-frame-animations.html) or [`spline`]()[^splines] or smoothing. These methods of interpolation are methods of creating or locating nearbyness. To `interpolate` in math is to create new knowledge (datapoints) based on existing knowledge (datapoints), or to estimate values at a position based on values from a nearby position. 

But I always mix up the terms `interpolate` and `interpellate`. To `interpellate` is to interrupt or intercede (again like interstitial) or to summon, cite, call out. Shall I interpolate the distance between `interpolate` and `interpellate`? Frantz Fanon describes being called out as a racialized body and witnessing himself as another person's brutal interpretation.[^Fanon] Louis Althusser describes being hailed by a representative of the State apparatus and understanding it is himself who is meant.[^Althusser] Both these interpellations are about being seen, about the necessity of submitting to this seeing, about shame. These interpellations are also crossing a distance, creating a nearness, pulling close under duress. This distance is a street or sidewalk, and it is also the conceptual distance between how someone else understands us and how we wish to be known. 

[^splines]: Splines were originally the physical, flexible materials used to create curves between points, used for calculations involved in arches, domes, and ship building. The principle relies on the resistance in materials, on the energy required to bend. 

[^Fanon]: Fanon, F. 1967. Black Skin, White Masks, trans. Charles Lam Markmann.

[^Althusser]: Althusser, L. 1970. "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes towards an Investigation)"

Interpolation divides up distance, quantifies it, makes it possible to cross (it leaps Zeno's paradox with stepping stones). Interpolation makes interpellation possible in computational regimes, because it helps map (define) an individual, through generalization. It pins one down to classificatory schemas (created from collections of other interpellated individuals). [These are weak-star topologies?.] Computationally, proximity helps us jump to conclusions about each other. 

How many kinds of measurements of distance are there? How many dimensions and ways to fold them?

We have created so many algorithms for pathfinding. We are constantly optimizing our ways across these spaces. We've created everything about space and time, and how to make more and less of it.

#### Nearbyness

I want to write a theory of nearbyness (near-bi-ness) that is not a theory of nearness. Not nearness as measures and scores, not proximity and similarity, not K-means and K-nearest-neighbors. This is `nearbyness` as a practice for `attending-to`, not `nearness` as a study for `assumption-making`. Nearbyness enacts — through what it places side-by-side, in conversation, in contact, in texture, in tension — that, and how, and why its elements require each other. Nearbyness prefigures the more-than which this closeness creates. This is a trans\*disciplinary practice, as more than the sum of its combined fields or niches, and it is a trans\*formative practice too. 

This nearbyness responds to computational values of compartmentalizing, modularity, and encapsulation, which silo off data from the code that operates on it. They separate disciplinary discources from politics and from each other. They separate for efficiency and understanding, security and containment. As Tara McPherson argues, computation's modular values emerged simultaneously with and in response to the civil rights movement in the US: "the very structures of digital computation correspond to larger cultural shifts that seek to cordon off race and to contain it" [-@mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018]. McPherson's metaphor of "lenticular" postcards, which show two separate images when viewed from different angles, demonstrate how modularity allows for invisibility, despite proximity. She argues that lenticular perspectives position 

>"our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference while forestalling connection and interrelation. [...] A lenticular logic is a logic of the fragment or the chunk, a way of seeing the world as discrete modules or levels, a mode that suppresses relation and context." 

>[XXX add Chun's promiscuous/leaky/slutty data]

From object-oriented programming to object-oriented ontology, from global supply chains to machine learning architectures, these projects deny their entanglements. They reduce these entanglements to magnitudes of distance in vector dimensions. Nearbyness resists this denial through reuniting them in conversation, bringing close without collapsing distinctions. 

>"The space between and the spaces among involve distances created by the disturbance of being close without being joined, and without mistaking the other's ﬂesh for one's own or any object world as identical to oneself. Nonsovereignty is not here the dissolution of a boundary. It's the experience of affect, of being receptive, in real time." [@berlantCommonsInfrastructuresTroubling2016]

These operations of nearbyness bring us to form and formative. The assembling logic here is of accretion and coalition – an *Arcades Project* of wandering, filing, putting like with like, but also unlike and other aspects together, or at least nearby. It is a machine learning task, an `un-machine un-learning` task, to decide how information goes together or does not, to find patterns in a system. It is also a very human activity. This project enacts the process through feeling. For some, like Vilém Flusser,[^Flusser] writing is a sculptor's cutting away. For others, like Walter Benjamin, writing is a collector's fever dream. I believe it is both, collecting fragments when you cannot yet see a form, when you cannot do anything else; then cutting away at them until what has already formed becomes clearer. 

<!-- accumulation and cutting away, pattern finding in collections of data, as the reverse proxies for making and testing theories, contraposed knowledge generating systems [Joque, Revolutionary Mathematics] -->

[^Flusser]: "[Writing] has nothing to do with constructing. It is, on the contrary, a taking away, a de-structing. It is, both structurally and historically, closer to sculpture than to architecture. It is a gesture of making holes, of digging, of perforating. A penetrating gesture. To write is to in-scribe, to penetrate a surface," 

<!-- write with the machine of me and the machines i have learned along the way.  --> 

[//]: # "the magnitude of the distance between them (close/far) of each dimension of the vector"

#### Formative 

What is formative shapes us. Our early experiences make us who we are. These are the foundations we can't see, the scaffolding of our thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops of human networks, codified language, and rare earth. How we become. How we become with and through sociotechnical systems. 

Each of the works that follow asks: What are the fundamental assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a dataset, a machine learning system, or programmers themselves? What are the formative assumptions underlying any technology or way of being? These works tease out the metaphors we have relied on so long we can no longer see them; they ask what other metaphors might make space for new forms or reforms.

Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can fill it. [I work in code and in art because I believe:] If I know how to make forms, or even platforms, not only the content to plug into existing forms, I am more free to work both form and content in iterative, ongoing relationships. This is how I knead the dough — form and content and form and content and form. They are inseparable.

In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make, through its insistence, resistence, grain, thread tension. It in-forms itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. It also re-forms me through this mutual process: 

>"In both carpentry and textiles, the form of a thing does not stand over it or lie behind it but emerges from this mutual shaping, within a gathering of forces, both tensile and frictional, established through the engagement of the practitioner with materials that have their own inclinations and vitality." [@ingoldLifeLines2015, 24]

Current modes of computational logic are not mutually constitutive in trans\*formative ways. Instead, they impose form on us as data subjects and subjectees. Computation requires information to take any output formations. Its orderly logic is a shape imposed by and reflecting the world. It requires contortion to represent us. Sarah Sharma reminds us, the Broken Machines who do not quite fit these regimes, "to represent is also to be filed away" [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020]. 

>"In order to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce. [...] perhaps we need to bring an end to the very notion of a scale. Displace all reduction. Agree not merely to the right to difference but, carrying this further, agree also to the right to opacity that is [not enclosure within an impenetrable autarchy but] subsistence within an irreducible singularity. Opacities can coexist and converge, weaving fabrics. To understand these truly one must focus on the texture of the weave and not on the nature of its components. For the time being, perhaps, give up this oid obsession with discovering what lies at the bottom of natures. There would be something great and noble about initiating such a movement, referring not to Humanity but ta the exultant divergence of humanities. Thought of self and thought ofother here become obsolete in their duality. Every Other is a citizen and no longer a barbarian. What is here is open, as much as this there. 1 would be incapable of prqjecting hum one ta the other. This-here is the weave, and it weaves no boundaries. The right to opacity would not establish autism; it would be the real foundation of Relation, in freedoms." [@glissantPoeticsRelation2009a, 190]

To understand through computation is to reduce to categorization's logics [@crawfordAtlasAIPower2021]. The formative structures we create (taxonomies, schemas, ways of knowing) support unknowing. They ease and smooth passage through our days and our systems. This is why we must imagine new forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new forms. 

Code forms, then calcifies. Pattern turns to template. `init --> name --> get --> set`[^oop] 

>"The more a path is used the more a path is used. [...] When an effort becomes normal, a form is acquired." [@ahmedQueerUse2018, @ahmedQueerPhenomenologyOrientations2006]

[^oop]: [cut this] Creating classes (initializing) in object-oriented programming) instantiates each instance of an object with the pre-determined form, adjustable only within those limits. Indicate what prior schemas you'll pull from, what parts you'll write over. What qualities you'll predetermine, and what aspects will be qualities of the entire class, and what qualities will be specific to each object. What actions will they know how to do? How will you establish and retreive this information? There's a language for all this in "object-oriented" programming, which requires a different sense of relationality than "functional" programming.

If forms shape content, and vice versa, of course tools also shape forms. Equipping ourselves with the knowledge, resources, and agency to make the tools (to make the platforms to make the forms to make the content) is necessary for a more holistic approach to researching formative tech and creating trans\*formative tech. Toolmaking includes collecting sets of tools, documenting and creating guides to existing tools as well. It also includes the infrastructures and support systems necessary to make any of these practices possible.

>"tools and infrastructure are not only the preconditions for the work; at their best, they are also part and parcel of the work, deeply integrated into its methods and outcomes. Our tools and infrastructures are rich objects to think with." [@mcphersonFeministSoftwareLab2018]

>"instruments develop through engaged and contingent practices. Instrumentalism involves setting in motion, operationalizing, and potentially transforming. Instruments—whether in the form of concepts or sensors—are instrumental to the unfolding, the doing, and the transforming" [@gabrysHowThingsSensors2019]

We think with our tools, instruments, sensors and the surrounding systems that enable them and maintain them. All of these layers are entangled. Susan Leigh Star calls infrastructure a "fundamentally relational concept," but one that despite its embeddedness operates invisibly unless broken. She also argues that infrastructure marks membership in relational groups, as we "acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects," practices, and standards [-@starEthnographyInfrastructure1999].  Thus infrastructure — and the tools, platforms, forms, and content that it consists of — also marks us as belonging, knowing, capable, welcome, or not. 

How do we think critically through re/making infrastructures, when they exist beyond any one of us, always relational and often invisible? By returning to, and reattuning to, the solidarities we find within and across communities, and the frictions we find within and across materials. 

Those who are left unsupported by infrastructures, those who are left out of representations or who are targeted disproportionately by digital systems, already know in deeply embodied ways about the friction they feel as they move through systems that do not easily contain their forms. Scholars Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsche, authors of the "Crip Technoscience Manifesto" [-@hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a], call these infrastructures "frictioned technologies" and emphasize:

>"the skills, wisdom, resources, and hacks disabled people utilize for navigating and altering inaccessible worlds. In pushing crip technoscience as a field of research and a practice of critical 'knowing-making', we conjure frictional practices of access production, acknowledging that science and technology can be used to both produce and dismantle injustice." [-@hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a]

Their manifesto reminds us that disabled people are not minoritized users of technologies created by experts but instead are experts themselves at actively adapting technologies to their needs. [This holds true for many other minoritized communities as well.] By centering their community as knowledge holders and creators, and by seeing "interdependence as a political technology," they shift the design goals for technology. Rather than outsiders providing services to achieve normalized individual independence, they reorient toward kinship building [-@hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a]. 

Louise Hickman's ethnographic work on the ethics of access foregrounds access workers' key role in the production of crip technoscientific knowledge. She examines the highly customized dictionaries developed by her own Communication Access Real-Time Translation operator working in academic spaces, in order to show how their captioning work for the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community is "both the practice of crip technoscience as well as its product." Hickman highlights the collaborative, embedded nature of the work and the crip technoscience emphasis on "knowledge-from-below." [@hickmanTranscriptionWorkPractices2019a]
[CITEMingus]

Thus, form is always forming from within complex systems of interrelation. Formative and transformative technologies are more (and less) than their forms. They must emerge on our own terms — from the formats and methods of the communities they serve, with our values, goals, and approaches leading the way. 

Interdependence has been my intuitive compass, my frustration and fascination, for as long as I remember. I have searched for the means to describe this feeling, through art, literature, touch, and other means. Slowly and repeatedly, I keep finding that the best resources for describing this sense of interdependence come from Indigenous sources. I keep returning to the realization that `Interdependence is indigenous knowledge.`

>"an object or thing is not as important as one's relationship to it. [...] reality *is* relationships or sets of relationships." [@wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008, 73]

Fundamentally reorienting our understanding of objects and knowledge and ourselves as consituted by our relationships necessarily also reorients our work and the forms it takes, in deeply formative ways. Re-prioritizing relationships fundamentally reshapes the forms and functions of research, artmaking, valuemaking, worldmaking. To see form (shape, object) as relation (connection) is to position it in time and place. It is also to take "form" from its noun form (shape, object) into its verb form (mold, press, begin to exist). [As Erin Manning says of the spiral, it is "more duration than form" [@manningAlwaysMoreOne2013].] Like all verbs, then, the verb form implies subjects — the entities enacting and impressing a form into being, responsible for it, caring for it. Relationships. [This negates object-oriented ontologies and object-oriented programs that want to encapsulate and abstract away objects' entanglements with the world.]

To frame research through relationships is also to foreground accountability by asking, as Shawn Wilson offers in *Research Is Ceremony*, "What am I contributing or giving back to the relationship? Is the sharing, growth and learning that is taking place reciprocal?" Wilson says that in an Indigenous Research Paradigm, "What is more important and meaningful is fulfilling a role and obligations in the research relationship—that is, being accountable to your relations" [-@wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008].

In this sense of reciprocity, the question of form takes shape as an offering. What does our creative work offer back, and in what form will that offering be most legible and accessible? Some forms I have tried: manifesto, toolkit, zine, prototype, platform, black box, machine, labyrinth, server, service, sentence, story, interface, guide, document, cauldron, process. 

As form moves into its verb shapes, identity too moves into practice. Johanna Hedva marks this as a pivot from identity politics to practices and methods, inextricably coupled as theory-practice: 

>"Disability, queerness, open source — not as identities, or groups I belong to, but as modes of doing, of how I practice myself. Being an outsider means that the question of theory and practice — how practice is affected by theory, how theory is constructed by practice — becomes the most important one. Membership to particular groups and experiences is often predicated on the visual — whether someone 'looks like' they belong or not — which means that my membership to most groups must rely on something else. My belonging has more to do with how I enact that group's politic" [@hedvaBelongingMess2018]

Our being-in-process is both the means to "be" (prefiguratively) and also the means of being-in-relation, -in-politic, -in-identity, in-between. 

>"this form is really just the web of relationships that have taken on a familiar shape. Every individual thing that you see around you is really just a huge knot-a point where thousands and millions of relationships come together." [@wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008]

<aside markdown=1 id="manning">
>"a node of relation expressing itself momentarily as this or that—an edging into object, a swerving into body." [@manningAlwaysMoreOne2013]
</aside>

I dream of a form that can hold everything. A form that can reveal how each part is connected. No parts, no compartments. Just connections.[^platformdream] Network graphs don't do it for me. Anna Munster suggests that the form of networks numbs us to their relationality. Because every network looks like every other, in trying to understand a system by depicting it as a network, we lose sense of what's within. Munster suggests focusing less on `forms` and more on `forces`: "the closures and openings of relations to one another. It is at this level of imperceptible flux—of things unforming and reforming relationally—that we discover the real experience of networks" [@munsterAesthesiaNetworksConjunctive2013]. The un/forming of relationality, these trans\*formative practices are active, ongoing, prefigurative, emergent, embodied, and embedded — taking shape and making change.

Just as a paper snowflake or a tie-dyed garment contains in its pattern the re-foldable traces of its making — a flattened, temporarily static version of its coming-into-shape, marking the places it once touched against itself as it held different forms [@sedgwickWeatherProust2012] — trans\*formative technocraft aims to "decipher the history of the making" and the future shapes it might take. 

[^platformdream]: I dream of a platform where I can write and code and share and cite and annotate and highlight and collage and print and remix and machine-read and connect. [In my dream notes, I have written "semantic web layer cake?" and "Gollum platform?" I rarely imagine I am the only one imagining such things, until I try to explain them to others. I expect it to be easy, that these hybrid forms already exist — becaue they seem so small and obvious to me, how complicated could they be? But when I try to find some preexisting version, I come up empty, frustrated, confused. And I am left without tools or language to begin building such a connected and connecting form on my own.] 


### Techno

* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered

Techno-solutionist... Techno-utopian... Techno-dystopian... 

Techtonic/techne

>"There can, of course, be no knots without the performance of knotting: we should therefore commence with the verb 'to knot' and view knotting as an activity of which 'knots' are the emergent outcomes. Thus conceived, knotting is about how contrary forces of tension and friction, as in pulling tight, are generative of new forms. And it is about how forms are held in place within such a force-field or, in short, about 'making things stick'.  Accordingly, our focus should be on forces and materials rather than form and content." (Ingold 2015, 18)
>"the tectonic would become ‘the art of joinings’."

[Dovetailedness]

Correspondence not assemblage: "This whole is a correspondence, not an assemblage, the elements of which are joined not ‘up’ but ‘with’. Whereas the agglutinative accretions of the assemblage are ‘and … and … and’, the diﬀerential sympathies of the correspondence are ‘with … with … with’." (Ingold 2015, 23) "sympathy is a ‘living with’ rather than a ‘looking at’, a form of feelingknowing that operates in the interstices of things, in their interiority. It is, Spuybroek writes, ‘what things feel when they shape each other’. 3"


Techno...music? Yes, always take dance breaks.

Techno means a plethora of prefix possibilities and digital-analog hybrids (think what "cyber-" was to the '90s). Also systems-oriented, bubbling science experiments, project-driven not damage-centered.

>"This possibility of creating directed, coordinated, and controlled sets of techniken that ensure a reliable link between the addressor and the addressee is the precondition of not only computing but also Althusserian interpellation. The technical conditions of various computational systems—analog, digital, or quantum thus turn out to be coterminous with the development of modern disciplinary states and their sociotechnicalities, and addressability emerges as a key shared operational logic."

#### these may go in the Toolkit instead...

It goes beyond the very valid criticism AI takes that it is biased because its data are biased ("garbage in, garbage out"). If an algorithm is at its most simple a set of instructions, a procedure (from the Babylonean), it seems obvious that it would be embedded with the assumptions of those who wrote those instructions, about how to implement that procedure. That is, there are many ways to do any task, informed by minute choices at every step. As these scale, and we know that at computational level these scale exponentially, the impact of these choices magnify and magnify. These choices have been normalized, naturalized, and neutralized by the mythology of the black box--and compounded by the computational speeds that allow thousands of operations to run per second. 

To not think to train on a variety of faces, or to include an operation in the code to account for language differences, happens because there is not a variety of perspectives in the room when these very human decisions are being made before, during, and after the data is being collected, before, during, and after the code is being written and run. 

#### Key forms & foundational concepts of generative AI systems explained

- "Machine conditioning" not machine learning: "the fuzzy usage of ‘learning’ anthropomorphises a mathematical optimisation process" [@gaitelyriqueFrancisHungerUnHype2021] or "interpretation machines" [@lohmannInterpretationMachinesContradictions2020]
- Replace neural metaphors: "Neurons" in neural networks are pre-set nodes that determine the weights and probabilities of information, ie *they do math.* The "brain" structure is a metaphor, what are other metaphors?
- Activation & loss
- Simplistic non-understanding:
  - "Given the statistical distribution of words in the vast public corpus of (English) text, what words are most likely to follow the sequence [...]? (Murray Shanahan (2022), "Talking About Large Language Models" @shanahanTalkingLargeLanguage2023)
- Vectors & Tensors: When you're a computer, everything's a number
- Models & Transformers: Encoding, Decoding
  - ML systems both create and interpret the numerical representations of information. 
- Semi/Un/Supervised depends on human labeling (see crowdwork below)
  - Was labeled, pre-sorted data used to train it? (Supervised) 
  - Or was the data unstructured, like plain text? (Unsupervised)
  - Unsupervised learning means data are even more essential to the models' outputs
- Complexity here is about scale: The speed and quantity of calculations that computation enables, NOT the complexity of those calculations themselves.
- Binaries & Booleans
  - Similarity & Difference
    - Often seen technically as a measure of "distance"
    - But of what "dimension" (aspect) and measured (represented numerically) in what way?
    - cosign similarity between the vectors (a function of the angle between the 2, cosign "normalizes" for scale)
    - What of the varied social understandings of similarity & difference?
  - Spatializing metaphors
  - "Grenzprobleme"
    - "Border problems" (via Pedro Oliveira)
    - "Our research shows that the BAMF's language analysis software makes mistakes - just like the people who use it."
    - Categorization is always a question of in/out-side. Concepts are codified through the creation and reproduction of these boundaries.

#### Classification logics

- Pervasive capture, data colonialism: 
  - >"the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction." (Nick Couldry & Ulises A. Mejias  [@couldryMakingDataColonialism2019])
- Garbage in, garbage out: 
  - Conscientious collection methods, values and questions 
  - Proprietary, missing, indecipherable data, practices and documentation
  - Labor:
    - "The data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour" [@ExclusiveHourWorkers]
    - "ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent,” Andrew Strait
    - "Automation runs on the averaged microjudgments of whole detachments of underpaid humans, not some supersmart computer." [Steyerl (2022) @steyerlMeanImages2023]
- Unacknowledged curation: 
  - >"All of these attempts to harmonize and create general descriptive languages are founded on a universalizing logic that in its most utopian dimensions believes that these political and infrastructural differences that stand in the way of classification are accidental and can ultimately be overcome." [Justin Joque (2015) @joqueDataCreationMeaning2015]
- Data bodies, algorithmic race & gender, the problem of representation: 
  - “your algorithmic gender may well contradict your own identity, needs, and values. Google’s gender is a gender of profitable convenience” (John Cheney-Lippold, We Are Data @cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017)
  - whose data are (not) included:
    - “we need to interrogate not only the security of our data but  [...] What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to [a boutique self-tracking device], the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?” (Jacqueline Wernimont, Numbered Lives @wernimontNumberedLivesLife2018)
    - whose stories are these? "what subject position allows us to ethically occupy, flourish, and move in a world of pervasive data monitoring? (Natasha Dow Schull)
- Worldbuilding with data: 
  - “Database design, in that way, is 'an exercise in worldbuilding,' a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views—a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race.” [@benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019]
- Uncertainty reduced to certainty 
  - "[The algorithm] presents something as a singular optimal output, when it is actually generated through multiple and contingent relations. [...] I understand the spatial logic of algorithms to be an arrangement of propositions that significantly generates what matters in the world." [@amooreCloudEthicsAlgorithms2020]
  - >>"If uncertainty is the ability for the unknown to be accounted for by comporting to containment under the logics of algorithmic models, then what can unknowability offer instead? [...]["BLACKNESS as space of ethical absence," "the unknown as a subject"] Unknowability born from the figure of the flesh opens the space for ways of understanding the world that are otherwise discounted because of their inability to be neatly measured and accounted for. It is the place in which irresolution is allowed to reside." (Morrison 2021, 255) >>"flesh becomes an essential outlier from which to assess the limitations of sociotechnical fixes. Flesh is the poignant, unavoidable signifier and text upon which to read the history and reality of total expropriation of value from bodies and land." (255) >>"leaving open the unresolved space of coming to know something that is relational: taking into consideration the specific context of the speaker, the place from which they speak, the closeness they share, and the mode through which that speaking happens. To know in this context is not a territorial claim to be made, enclosed, and defended but an endured practice of proximity. To speak nearby is a gesture of knowing that requires engagement, perforating the hermetic encapsulation of totality." (253) *relational knowing* [@morrisonFlesh2021]

#### Tech is TechNO (Refusal, Tactical Media)``

Not accepting models as the world we want to live in: 
>"Machine learning and predictive models as they currently exist can also resist reduction, but only if we treat the gaps between their results and our realties as spaces for political action, not errors to be fixed. We need to treat these models as we do global climate change models. GCC models offer us the most probable future, given past actions, not so that we accept that future, but so we work to change it. Only global climate change deniers seek to fix the model, rather than the world." @chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021

>Nam June Paik's call to "make technology ridiculous." (*We Are in Open Circuits*)


Open source projects are often open in name only. Zhong argues that not only do they [large corporate entities proporting the term] often fail to offer substantive contributions to open-source communities, they misuse the term "open source" to get free labor. 

>"In the same way big oil brands itself with greenwashing for illusory environmental progressiveness, big tech extol their open source efforts to open-wash their capitalist, monopolistic, and destructive reality. Technological development is in dire need for a policy-first, documentation-first, ideology-first methodology, and AI must transform its focus on creating systems which understands and addresses the complexity of its environment, critically assesses its context, and produces meaning-rich results." (Elea Zhong 2023)

Machine unlearning ([ender 2023](https://www.enderverse.org/notes/unlearning.html)) points out that new field of machine unlearning, which springs up due to the problem (created by machine learning's indiscrimine data scraping problem) assumes access to the models it wants to alter, assumes a powerful role with agency in big tech. Instead, ender combines questions of machine unlearning with adversarial data poisoning to ask how one can remove data from a model without access to the initial model. 



Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse their materials to engage political [potentials]. In her "Manifesto of the Broken Machine," Sarah Sharma shows how we might work *with* perceptions of [women and others as] outliers and errors, in order to work *against* the systems that frame them as such: **"A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves."** @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020

>As "an investment in a multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions," says Raley, "tactical media activities provide models of opposition rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau reminds us, 'itself remains intact.'" [@raleyTacticalMedia2009]
>"practices such as reverse engineering, hacktivism, [...] the digital hijack, [...] collaborative software, and open-access technology labs, ' tactical media' is a mutable category [...]. tactical media signifies the intervention and disruption ... disturbance.
>"Tactical media is performance for which a consumable product is not the primary endgame; it foregrounds the experimental over the physical." 

David Garcia and Geert Lovink describe tactical media as "An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike." [@garciaGarciaLovinkABC]

>"learning to inhabit the world in a better way [...] the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real" (Bourriaud in Raley Tactical Media)

>"the lesson I think we need to learn from tactical media practitioners more broadly is that critique and critical reflection are at their most powerful when they do not adopt a spectatorial position on the (putatively neutral) outside, when they do not merely sketch a surface, but rather penetrate the core of the system itself, intensifying identification so as to produce structural change." (Raley "Dataveillance and Countervailance" in @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013)

#### No to capital and Yes to sharing

TechNO is also open-access, open-source — in their refusal to capitulate to capitalist regimes of encapsulation, privatization, knowledge-hoarding and gatekeeping. 

#### Tech is Techne

Tech begins with techne, begins with fiber, begins with the meshy matrix that sustains us. [@plantZerosOnes1998] Tech means any tool. It means not only clay tablets but language becoming discrete written letters instead of a chorus of breath. [@carsonErosBittersweetEssay2014]
It includes the histories of technology erased and rewritten by narratives of conquest and power [cite?]. It includes technologies of passing, of obfuscation, of survival. It includes [XXX]

Ursula M. Franklin sees technology as a practice, the way things are done, not only the tools with which they are done — a system that includes "far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004] She argues this show its deep link with culture. 
>"technology defined as practice shows us the deep cultural link of technology." // holistic / prescriptive technologies. 

Thinking of coding as craft moves it back into the realm of holistic technologies, focused on the practitioner, rather than prescriptive ones, focused on production, effectiveness, scale, and management. Franklin says prescriptive technologies, while often  "exceedingly effective and efficient, [...] come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it.'" Meanwhile holistic technologies require muscle memory and instinct; they allow the practitioner to "draw on their own experience, each time applying it to a unique situation." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004]

### Craft

Focusing on craft means noticing the material, iterative, handmade, tinkering, iterative, process-oriented, embodied practices of knowledge and production that technologies emerged from, and how these practices can intervene in or reshape technologies, too. 

* handmade, craft, iterative, durational practices
* communities of practice
* deep interdisciplinarity

"hands and handiwork, and the deep, inherent relationality of touch and texture," [@sedgwickWeatherProust2012]

Texture, for Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, is a way of talking about the space between dimensions or scales, or the transition between them. From point to line to cube to cube moving through space-time to a multidimensional universe of vibrating strings. In computation, from scalar to vector to matrix to tensor in many dimensions. All kinds of warp and weft, describing many directions of touch and contact.

>"the sense of touch makes nonsense out of any dualistic understanding of agency and passivity; to touch is always already to reach out, to fondle, to heft, to tap or enfold, and always also to understand other people or natural forces as having effectually done so before oneself, if only in the making of the textured object." [@sedgwickWeatherProust2012]

Here Sedgwick connects the experience of making craftwork with experiencing the made craft, with touching and being touched by, with multidimensional sense and scale of the universe. I also see this as a way of understanding machine learning modeling through new, non-hierarchical metaphors of technocraft. "dramatizes its dimensional betweenness"

>"rosa [travelling server] is not only constituted in hardware or sotware, but also the multitude of relations that are created around the making, maintaining and passing on of this infrastructure: the processes that are performed, the afective charge of their actioning, the community around them." @TraversalNetworkFeminista

>"As sewing is a technique of making that has been used primarily by women throughout history, and continues to be primarily the task of women in sweatshops in the global South, my proposal of the stitch as a material and conceptual operation can be seen as feminist, a way of generating new concepts by learning from people who have been subject to material inequalities because of their gender, their race, and their geographic location. The stitch can be thought of as the basis for a theory of feminist making, which values the forms of knowledge practiced daily by oppressed people as they make their lives in the face of violence. This places the stitch in the repertoire of strategies including the methodology of the oppressed, as described by Chela Sandoval, and the science of the oppressed, as proposed by Monique Wittig and elaborated by the art collectives *particle group* and the Electronic Disturbance Theater (with which I collaborate). 16  The operation of creating relations through the stitch, of finding means to connect groups of people who had been separated, can be seen as an abstraction of the work of women of color feminism, which sought to bring together women across racial lines. The stitch can be a way of imagining the community building necessary to create community-based responses to violence" @cardenasTransColorPoetics2016

#### Process oriented approaches

What uncomfortable affects/emotions emerge when we are brought into process? When the veil falls away that divided the maker from the audience? What do process-oriented modes reveal that we don't want to see? Neoliberal disgust with imperfection. The labor being asked of us, the labor we place upon ourselves. 

* I'm not sure who the we I use is, already collective data? Already acknowledging myself is diffuse? not sure who i'm writing from or what unstable gender, self I am. 
* situating subject positions

#### communities of practice
* thin description, humble un-/knowing, kaleidoscopic subjectivity
* kinship & levels of access (self, editor, family, ally, neighbor, comrade, citizen, stranger)
* how a person became a user, decoupled from their sense of agency or impact or ability to shape the 'text' (see immersive data id) (lurking book)

#### immersive data identities
person as user abstracts away agency as maker, eliminates the writerly open text of the web1.0 into the commercialized web2.0/social web into the datified self (see communities of practice)
- Loukissas' "all data are local" (the relativity of the network, the position, scale). data settings not data sets (place setting, "thinking locally is thinking critically")
  - >>"When data do seem to confer transparency, it is because we are shielded from important details about the context of their creation or display."
  - >>"data-driven systems [...] are locally contingent and even fragile. Designs dependent on data must be maintained and repaired on a regular basis to ensure that they are in sync with changes in the data themselves or the encompassing infrastructure of the place."

#### Hand scale, accessibility

Craft does not scale, but can be used in resistance to scale. Using handmade, hand labor is one very important tactic still available to tackle the seemingly insurmountable scale of giant datasets we are living under the regime of now. 

The anarchist's toolchest, simple tools known well. 

AI and knitting: Simple gestures repeated into habit, into complexity.

Craft suggests repair, and error, and air. 

#### A craft approach also organizes labor and relations differently. 

>"The alignment of craft and craftiness is perhaps the best location to find a unifying thread that runs throughout the diverse technical and ethical worlds of hacking. [...] all hackers fit the bill as quintessential “craftspeople,” [...] Even if craftspeople tend to work in solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on shared rules of engagement and standards for quality." 
>>"Intellectual guile" (outside the box)
>>"Craftiness, then, can be seen as thinking outside the box, or circumvention of inherent technological limitations in pursuit of craft. But we can also understand craftiness as exceeding mere instrumentality."
Coleman aligns hackers with crafts guilds. Requires "intellectual guile"
>[@colemanHackers2016]

>"Resistance to the Current: The Dialectics of Hacking"  @soderbergResistanceCurrentDialectics2022

**TechnoCraft** honors historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft — which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community — and aligns them with the aspects of technology which get overlooked: namely, the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the global majority.

[Black Gooey Universe]

>Core rope memory [From the Sasha](https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/from-the-sasha-into-the-zamani-death-as-a-moment-of-radical-continuity/) "During the pioneering of the Apollo spacecraft mission, women workers manually wove memory into computer systems, translating software programmed by MIT engineers into physical binaries. The first woman to do this was Hilda G. Carpenter, a Black lab technician who advanced the methods that would ultimately be used to land Apollo missions on the moon. These threading techniques, referred to as 'core rope memory' and 'magnetic core memory,' were laborious processes of physically coding information into machines using ferrite rings and copper wire to control the flow of electricity"

>"Weaving was already multimedia: singing, chanting, telling stories, dancing, and playing games as they work, spinsters, weavers, and needleworkers were literally networkers as well." [@plantZerosOnes1998, 65]

>"they process and store data. Because there is no difference between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous. [@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 66]

>"weaving wends its way through even the media which supplant it. While paper has lost its associations with the woven fabrics with which it began, there are .remnants of weaving in all writing: yarns continue to be spun, texts are still abbreviated textiles, and even grammarglamor-and spelling retain an occult connectivity. Silkscreens, printing presses, stencils, photographic processes, and typewriters: by the end of the nineteenth century images, texts, and patterns of all kinds were being processed by machines which still used matrices as means to their ends," [@plantZerosOnes1998, 69]

#### What craft allows

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one's expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices." (Anuradha Reddy, Digital Creativity, 2022 "The Internet of Towels (2022) @reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022)
>"hybridizing or taking apart AI systems through material translations and free associations [...] these artefacts do not carry out the work of reconstructing or stitching back together what has been taken apart or hybridized by artificial everyday creativity" [@reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022]

#### Craft means taking care and care-taking

- Queer zine and newsletter networks
>"lesbian-feminist information infrastructures are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions."
[@mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020]

- Feminist server art

>"The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care, but also to generate care. [...] In the perspective proposed here, generating care means counting in participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of understanding."
>>[@delabellacasaMattersCareTechnoscience2011]

>"All kinds of infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor, [...and] their study can more precisely be understood as a concern of *feminist* aesthetics in particular." —Ines Kleesattel, Situated Aesthetics for Relational Critique: On Messy Entanglements from Maintenance Art to Feminist Server Art in [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]

Sustaining feminst servers takes "years of intense collective learning" (Kleesattel [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]). "Tensions, ambivalences and immanent differences are uncomfortable and messy—and precisely therefore crucial for [...] Feminist Server Art," says Kleesattel. It holds "interrelated dimensions of actual hardware and software, common infrastructures, limited resources, care- and service labors, more-than-human poetics and speculative fabulations."

   >"the tyranny of structurelessness, for instance. The difference between the people that developed the code, and the people that create the links and the interface with the inhabitants, the users of those networks, we didn't call them users, but inhabitants, because we wanted them to be involved in the management of that infrastructure." (Spideralex)

   >>from an Introduction to Technological Sovereignty by [Margarita Padilla(https://sobtec.gitbooks.io/sobtec2/content/en/content/01preface.html)]:
   >>"So as with all other sovereignty, technological sovereignty is made in communities. Communities exist and they are everywhere. unceasingly creating and recreating themselves, shared flats, neighborhoods, friends, workmates, professional networks, extended families, communities are everywhere. As with any symbolic construction communities are not something you can see with your eyes. They are something you see with your mind and feel the bonds with your heart. For those of us fighting for technological sovereignty, communities are a tangible reality. They're there. We see them and we feel them and though technologies theories are, typically related to consumer, luxury goods and insulated individualism. This is only the vision presented by the industry and the market, a market that seeks to isolate and be Wilder consumer, all technologies developed in community, these communities can be more or less autonomous or more or less controlled by cooperation, the struggle for sovereignty is about these communities, nobody invents, builds, or codes alone, quite simply because the task is such that it would be impossible."

   >"any infrastructure you need to set up from scratch, it's slow, and then it becomes like, it goes faster, it accelerates at one stage, I don't know why, I guess that you need to build the structure, the infrastructure that is going to be sustaining everything. And when you are figuring how to build it, or what is the better ways when things are slower. [...] And when you build a project that is based on informal and volunteer work, to maintain an infrastructure, things are gonna be slow, because yeah, we are all feminists. So we are very busy. We are struggling in different fights that are sometimes death and life important. And of course, like being able to learn to administrate services or host contents, maybe is not always the first thing in our list."

   >"Of course, all the feminist hack labs, fab labs, bio labs, feminist radios, servers, and artificial intelligence, internet bots and protocols that are developed or think or theorize from a feminist perspective. All the work around restorative justice process, feminist science fiction and futurotopis, building feminist libraries and fanzines, developing documentation and memory tools. Contributing to the herstory, producing and maintaining self defense resource about digital, connected space but also physical security. Permacultural gardens. Other gardens. Lands. Spells. Rituals. These tools, techniques for lives, land defending, all these are important and is part of the feminist infrastructure we are interested in."

**These are always-already cooperative systems. Want to write/build/make/create in ways that reveal and allow these to flourish and expand as healthier, kinder systems that are supportive of everyone who is part of them.**
TERM: *Deep Interdisciplinary* is able to view these fundamental states as hybrid, not only different fields or concepts but the core ways of seeing/being/becoming. The approach of constantly shifting lenses and destabilizing and viewing as spectra. Ontologically interdisciplinary. (not ontology or being but becoming, process philosophy). Bakhtin’s heteroglossia ("another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way" (1934)) and polyphony. But what are the larger interfaces & infrastructures that could enable hybrid language and switching across, that can facilitate expanded ways of thinking?

Thus, **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne. 


## def main(): What's Included

Each section of Trans\*formative TechnoCraft offers an enactment of this thinking from a different angle, combining to enact the ethics and tactics described above. Together these public-facing resources attempt to provide plainspoken translations of technical, aesthetic, and ethical concepts in approachable zine formats, in order to support both AI insiders and marginalized outsiders in understanding the urgency of the issues facing automated technologies and the necessity of each other’s skill sets in facing those issue. 

The research foundational to this artistic practice is a critical reflection on the technical aspects of natural language processing and dataset processing techniques that support the latest systems, while situating their cultural and material antecedents through lenses of power. 

### CRAFT: *Coding.Care*

* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts

In *Coding.Care* I detail five years of engaging [XXX]

>Code Collective is a distinctive community of practice and pedagogical space that welcomes and supports many kinds of learners. For almost five years, this diverse hack lab has hosted workshops and hybrid-format meetings, while growing and shifting to meet the needs of our community—from pandemic support to alumni programming. The Collective unites students who may have zero technical experience with those who have lots—and values their experiences equally, with the mantra: "We all have something to teach each other." Through the Collective’s intimidation-free, learner-led, process-oriented approach, it theorizes and models caring community building and innovative university lab space, plus non-academic community workshops that can create knowledge transfer across disciplinary and social strata of all kinds. 
*I have adapted this format to guest faculty roles and workshops at Ars Electronica, Transmediale, Mozilla Festival, Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, and elsewhere.* 

*Coding.Care* offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. It focuses on Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in early 2019 for emerging media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Here, we see creative-critical code as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its <span class="purple">guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition."</span> It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now 3+ years-old community, like how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methods from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work. <span class="purple">Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</span>

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an <span class="purple">ethics of coding care</span>—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: "We all have something to teach each other." Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly "anyone can join." Rather, Coding.Care reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.

### * : *Interstitial Portals*

These essays are meant to be portals to other times and places where "the past is not lost, however, but rather a space of potential." @chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021 Past-present-future are spaces to know our relationships with systems differently and intimately. @olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021 

>"the future is not in front of us, it is everywhere simultaneously: multidirectional, variant, spontaneous. We only have to *turn around*. Relational solidarities, even in their failure, reveal the plurality of the future-present, help us to see through the impasse, help temporarily eschew what is stagnant, help build and then prepare to shatter the many windows of the here and now." @olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021 
>"The imagination is central to the cultural production of revolutionary movements; its primary role is to signal *what could be. What could be* is a lingistic stand-in for a set of political, social and cultural demands, strategic aims, revolutionary longings. As such, it resists singular definition."  

Michel de Montaigne called his essays 'trials' or 'attempts'. These interstitial essays are attempts (essay: to try). They are also trials in the sense of struggles, to get at the core of the thing by sneaking between its ribs. They glance against logical modes of academic critical analysis or direct writing [as the production of use or call to action [XXXword?]] to be the thing and interrogate the thing at once.  

>"to let this book be the crisis rather than about the crisis or crises, rather, a plurality of traumas and pains felt collectively and individually." @cerankowskiSutureTraumaTrans2021

>"constituting life through the act of writing—rather than as expressive (describing a life that exists prior to the act of writing about it)." @fournierAutotheoryFeministPractice2021

Interest is about associative power, and connection
>"Isabelle Stengers argues that "interesting" in science involves a similar binding of subjects to subjects. Noting that "interest" derives from interesse, "to be situated between," @ngaiOurAestheticCategories2015

### Permissive processing

My favorite pieces of writing all feel permissive. In the moment of reading, I feel alive with the thought, "it's allowed to write this way?" And then, "Who is allowed to write this way? Maybe only after certain requirements are met." I'm not sure I am, which is why I will try, in hope that my doing edges open a little more space for others and othered writing forms.

It is a kind of processing — the same information moved through the gut, through the body, rather than computational processing. 

>"In projects like Theory Boner, artists and writers and curators come together to configure critical theory as something that must be processed and transmuted through the body and is very physical and even sexual in its effects on us; like [Hazel] Meyer's No Theory No Cry, [these works] make space for a way of relating to theory that is embodied, affective, and more directly relevant to the lives of queer and gender-nonconforming feminist artists, activists, and students. @fournierAutotheoryFeministPractice2021

#### Bias cuts

In another take on "bias" (because bias cannot be "optimized" out of systems), these are bias cuts striking diagonally or diffractively across the warp and weft of the fabric of the other texts here. Cutting and sewing on the bias puts fabric in tension, making garments that take the shape of the bodies they surround. Bias cuts are ways of working with and against materials, acknowledging their limits and not resolving them to right angles. 

#### Analogue antecedents

We have always-already been living in, talking about, performing with the questions amplified by automated systems, classifiation, and datafication. These essays engage in dialogue with 20th century media artists with a wide range of practices  — from daily ritual and minimalism to queer feminist body art and performance, from video made in isolation to public intervention — and they read their works as analogue pre-responses to AI systems. Their works show the breadth of artistic possibilities for reconsidering our relationships with computational systems was already establishing itself in parallel to the development of those systems. They also help me reimagine how I encounter data and AI systems now.





### TECH: *The Intersectional AI Toolkit*

>The Toolkit gathers and synthesizes aspects of queer theory, Black feminism, transfeminisms, and decolonial perspectives that can contribute valuable lenses for machine learning’s most pressing problems. It celebrates work done by other intersectional researchers and artists working to address these issues in many fields. And it is one of the few resources to clarify, without math or jargon, the inner workings of AI and how they always operate as sociotechnical systems. As a digital platform, it creates a forum for others to expand upon the work; and through in-person and hybrid-online workshops, it invites a variety of communities to participate directly in the systems that impact them.

Why a toolkit, the pleasures and problems of toolkits, the anarchist's toolchest: 
- >"space of 'instruction, contingency, action, and alternative engagement'" [@gabrysHowThingsSensors2019, 92]
  - >"Tool kits provide instructions not just for assembly and use but also for attending to the social and political ramifications of digital devices." [@gabrysHowThingsSensors2019] "Tool kits offer up a particular way of concretizing maker-subjects, items for construction, modes of assembly, models of action, modes of becoming, desired outcomes, and ways of holding things together, or binning it all away. Tool kits are ways of organizing problems and relations for action, and even when the point is to crack open the black box of a sensor technology, the component parts that result from such crackery are configured in particular ways to allow for new modes of assembly."

>"What's unique about such IFH/MSs [intersectional feminist hacker/makerspaces] is that they are designed specifically to meet the needs and interests of the communities they are by and for, thereby allowing for a truly revolutionary *reimagining* of a 'different concatenation of social forms, knowledge, and technology'. In so doing, IFH/MS members articulate a strategy of hacking not only software and hardware, but their own social reproduction within the cybersphere."

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.

<!-- Broadly these have been called data subjects. For clarity, I distinguish between data subjects, whose information is captured in datasets that train machine learning models, and data subjectees, who are interpellated by and bear the impact of those models when implemented as part of AI systems. We are all the sovereign Data State's subjects, and we are all subject to its gaze as data subjectees.  -->

  - >"holds in suspicion the prestige the commons concept has attained in the US and theory-cosmopolitan context, often signifying an ontology that merely needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up to it. Although the commons claim sounds like an uncontestably positive aim, the concept in this context threatens to cover over the very complexity of social jockeying and interdependence it responds to by delivering a conﬁrming aﬀective surplus in advance of the lifeworld it’s also seeking. [...] the attachment to this concept is too often a way of talking about politics as the resolution of ambivalence and the vanquishing of the very contingency of nonsovereign standing that is at the heart of true equality, [...] 
  - >**"the commons concept is a powerful vehicle for troubling troubled times. [...] The better power of the commons is to point to a way to view what’s broken in sociality, the diﬃculty of convening a world conjointly, although it is inconvenient and hard, and to offer incitements to imagining a livable provisional life."**
  - >[...] The commons is an action concept that acknowledges a broken world and the survival ethics of a transformational infrastructure. This involves using the spaces of alterity within ambivalence."
  - >"form is not only a wish for a refuge, a cushion: it is also social, an exposure, a mediation, and a launching pad in relation to which beings can ﬁnd each other to ﬁgure out how to live in a movement that takes energy from the term ‘‘movement’s’’ political resonance."
  - >"taking each other on and in but never collapsing the distance that allows for attention. To take something in is to be nonsovereign in relation to it, but that’s not equal to being destroyed by it."




>"the manifesto has given way to the tool kit. The manifesto form of often dogmatic proclamations has yielded to a more open-ended organization of practices. Radical tool kits in particular gather instruments and resources that serve as practical philosophies and modes of organizing in difficult circumstances. [...] tool kits can be shape-shifting genres that variously provide guidance for rerouting, or reinforcing, sociopolitical practices" [@gabrysHowThingsSensors2019].
