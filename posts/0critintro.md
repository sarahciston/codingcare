# Trans*formative TechnoCraft

To build safer, more equitable AI systems, we need stronger creative–critical coding communities. To build these communities, we need approachable, critical perspectives on AI systems. Both efforts cannot exist without each other.

## Creative–Critical–Care Entanglements

Trans*formative TechnoCraft argues for the essential entanglement of critical AI and creative-critical coding communities, showing how each is predicated on the other. No intervention in disproportionately harmful algorithmic systems is possible without critically aware approaches to technologies from deeply plural perspectives. No such proliferation of perspectives is possible without inviting spaces to understand, interrogate, and reimagine the infrastructures that support those systems. 

>"Anyone who has ever woven or knitted knows that one can change patterns [...] but, more importantly, they know *there are other patterns*. The web of technology can indeed be woven differently, but even to discuss such intentional changes of pattern requires an examination of the features of the current pattern and an understanding of the origins and the purpose of the present design." 
>>—Ursula M. Franklin (@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004)

🖼 Yet, how do we participate on our own terms, in order to change systems to suit us? Especially when <span class="purple">learning programming is so often intimidating and riddled with false starts,</span> which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. 

### We Need Intersectional Critical AI 

>"I’m stuck here inputting and outputting the data of a story I can’t change." 
>>(Italo Calvino "The Burning of the Abominable House" 1976)

With every hype, the anti-hype: 

>"Questions like 'is a computer creative' or 'is a computer an artist' or the like should not be considered serious questions, period. In the light of the problems we are facing at the end of the 20th century, those are irrelevant questions. Computers can and should be used in art in order to draw attention to new circumstances and connections and to forget 'art'." 
>>(Frieder Nake "There Should Be No Computer Art" 1971) 

Questions about art, creativity, and labor in relation to AI are fundamentally questions trying to define humanity — *What makes us creative or empathetic? What makes us different from machines? What makes us human?* They are old, old questions. They also emerge from centuries of colonialized framings of 'man' as an idealized, individual white western subject. Hyped AI discourse explores limited questions about AI because it continues to draw from limited perspectives, letting status quo narratives about humans and automated systems frame the terms of debate. 

AI hype describes machine learning systems as impenetrable black boxes. It designs the interfaces with which we engage its tools, it claims the proprietary restrictions that hide its data (our data), and it influences the regulations that keep its power in the hands of a select few. We only break out of those boxes when we refuse to engage on those terms. 

>Kate Crawford argues that computational "ways of seeing depend on the twin moves of abstraction and extraction. But these logics can be challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected."

Automated decision-making systems disproportionately harm the marginalized majority. We are subject to it whenever we lend our data by clicking terms of service pop-ups to make them go away and whenever we must be recognized by borders, banks, and bureaucracies of any kind. Our vulnerability in these moments is exploited and profited on — from testing biometric facial technologies in refugee camps [@neddenBiometrieGetestetMillionen2017] to reinforcement learning reliant on AI chatbot user responses. Many amazing researchers have highlighted the increasing impacts of AI systems and surveillance capitalism [footnote cite Browne, Gebru, et al]. 

The task of Critical AI researchers and makers is to engage these systems as sociotechncial objects embedded in their historical, social, context. We must be "situated in proximity to the thing itself, cultivating some degree of participatory and embodied expertise, whether archival, ethnographic, or applied (Raley & Rhee, 2022 [@raleyCriticalAIField2023]). This requires interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives. 

Kimberlé Crenshaw's iconic analysis of power, called Intersectionality,[@crenshawDemarginalizingIntersectionRace1989] "critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally." [@cooperIntersectionality2016] 

Intersectionality can reveal the human costs of finding ourselves caught within these algorithmic systems – their proliferating data and supporting material infrastructures, as well as their consolidating power and supporting sociocultural infrastructures. Their power is differential by design. Conversations about AI fairness, transparency, explainability, ethics, public good, and the various hype cycles of each new technology are grossly incomplete without intersectional analyses of power and intersectional tactics of (and beyond) equity and inclusion. No change *about* us *without* us. 

As industry implementations of so-called intersectional tech reduce these complex concepts into flattened ideas of fairness and representation [@ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a], we need multimodal, polyvocal, experimental approaches that cut through the technological solutionism. [@cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019] 

>"We must begin with the knowledge that new technologies will not simply redistribute power equitably within already established hierarchies of difference. The idea that they will is the stuff of utopian naivete and technological determinism that got us here to begin with. The Broken Machine should not be understood as a new technology. It is not an upgrade to an older model or a feminist design solution." [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020]

### We Need Creative–Critical–Caring Approaches 

How do we reconnect the communities of practice who are building technologies and those who are equipped with the knowledge to consider its most urgent questions? 

Caring, creative, and critical approaches must be combined in order to adapt the spaces where technologies are discussed, designed, and implemented. Those spaces are missing the essential perspective of those most at the margins, who are most capable of addressing the urgent issues facing technology. These concerns are not new, nor strictly digital. They have been addressed by a wide range of communities with different types of knowledge for centuries. Many are calling for that knowledge to be applied here. [cite][indigenous, queer, other applications of AI]

Yet intimidating, isolating cultures around the specialization of computation and programming practices have left so many of us out of these conversations. [cite][Vee, Abbate, Hicks] 

How do we reunite? 

We need access. We need our contributions to be valued, for the effort toward understanding to be mutual because all participants know we all have important contributions to make. 

Access includes many aspects. It requires connecting an individual's current understanding and circumstances to the [item in question]. It considers like material, financial, intellectual, social resources that allow entry points. 

I may be capable of understanding how a machine learning system works, but not have the prerequisite vocabulary to enter a conversation in order to learn about it. 

I may understand how to operate a machine learning system, but not have the financial resources needed to run a resource-intensive devices in order to use one.

I may have knowledge and resources to share, but not be able to participate because barrier-free access, transcription, gender-inclusive language, or other inclusive aspects were not prioritized by the organizers. 



>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public." 
>>–bell hooks @hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994

These works are written as jargon-free as possible to allow them to travel as broadly as possible. While 

#### Holistic approaches / Care means critical 

>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public."

>"By reinforcing the idea that there is a split between theory and practice or by creating such a split, both groups [elite academia and anti-intellectuals] deny the power of liberatory education for critical consciousness, thereby perpetuating conditions that reinforce our collective exploitation and repression.
>>–bell hooks @hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994

>"Theory is not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. lt fulfills this function only when we ask that it do so and direct our theorizing towards this end."


It requires we reunite the divisions between theory and practice, between user and programmer, which were artificially split from the start. [XXXexplain] [^hoff] [^nardi] It requires un-siloing of domains and disciplines, the artificial boundaries that devide technologists from activists. 

It requires we find common language, common value/appreciation/respect that comes with working knowledge of the whole working system. 


#### Approachable, accessible // Care means access



#### Research tensions

To sit a bit longer with questions I know I cannot answer, questions that make me uneasy. To hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously and let their magnetic energy push-pull me. To forgive myself the imperative outcomes, the productivity, the proven hypothesis, the subject of research. To put myself into the trouble too, because I already embody these questions in lived experience.

#### Artistic experimentation

The case for combining creative and critical practices is already strong, and has been made elsewhere by many [XXXexpand][cite]. I am interested in how this work shows up as experimentation and particularly in how artistic experiments can challenge paradigms in machine learning, data science, and technology more broadly. 

I have found artistic research practices can interrogate systems and imagine new ones. For me, it combines rigorous scholarly investigation, deep community building and activism, and creative play in ways that can connect to broader non-academic audiences. 

Art has been the space where I’m able to unpack complex ideas for myself, because I can treat them more freely as artistic materials. It’s where I’m able to follow instinct and feel into how my tools, platforms, and forms shape their outputs and outcomes. 

It’s also the space where I feel able to imagine wildly, creating digital objects that should exist but don’t, or couldn’t exist but might. In my experience, this imaginative work is central to supporting very practical next steps and strategies. It is central to supporting more open access to communities of practice where others can continue the kinds of artistic experimentation that challenge paradigms in new forms I might never imagine.
 
This is a practice of artistic research, arts-based research, and/or research creation (different lineages and regions call it different things)[cite]. 


## What Is Trans\*formative TechnoCraft?

### Trans\*formative

Trans\*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It means justice-oriented, community-oriented, process-oriented practices. 

'Transformative' includes transformative justice, a movement which recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it. It moves beyond punative, carceral logics to imagine and create different, even healing systems [cite]. Reparative and restorative acts are part of this work, but the terms 'reparative' and 'restorative' in relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Instead I find the broader sense of 'transformative' resonates for me with trans\*, intersectional, and inclusive approaches to identities and [politics][— as well as to this project, its participants, its influences, and its intentions].

<!-- "politics of creation, prefigurative politics" -->

Trans\*formative is an active, prefigurative [footnote] stance. It aligns more with processing than its synonym programming, as a more embodied crossover between computational and cognitive, digital and digestive practices. Processing means both working through trauma and central processing unit. It means both works-in-process and algorithmic processes. Let's inspect further...

>>"Revolutionary movements require a teleological pool from which to draw. The imagination is that teleological pool: it not only creates liberatory drives; it sustains, justifies and legitimises them. It undoes entire epistemes and clears a space for us to create something new. Though this 'newness', or the demand for something else, can never fully be realised in the realm of the discursive, it exists in other registers: it can be felt, heard, touched, tasted. The structural limits of this world restrict our ability to articulate all that the imagination is capable of conceiving. Do not forget this." @olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021


#### Transformers

Transformers are the kinds of machine learning architectures currently being employed to create large models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. They are good at digesting large clumps of text, images, video (each as numbers) and reconstituting them. Their main parts are called encoders and decoders, and it's often said that we don't know what exactly is going on in these hidden layers. But I find it  more interesting that *they* do not know what is going on in these hidden layers of their own architecture. While they process and produce meaning (input and output), they are not "aware" of the meaning of the content they are processing along the way. 

Transformers are the latest, but won't be the last, in a long string of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees to submit to their "superior" logics. With every iteration on their forms, we repeat their hype but lose trace of their histories in "race science" and colonizing power that captures what it means to know and be known. [cite]

The paper that launched a thousand transformer models was called "Attention Is All You Need." Transformer language models incorporate context through a mechanism called "self-attention" that examines the word-units surrounding each word-unit they interpret. [@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023] We need more than self-attention. We need self-reflection and co-regulation. We need systems that, in their very architectures, celebrate difference rather than erase it.  

<!-- each of these para could be expanded. in critAI-genAI paper? -->

#### Trans\*

To move from the "transformer" model architecture to trans*formative tech and technocraft means to acknowledge the requisite entanglement of community building and [critical sociotechnical systems]. It means knowing the material we are transforming — by sharing in it, speaking nearby, walking beside, realizing what of it constitutes us or supports us.

This work is about trans\*lation and trans\*formation and trans\*gression.[^hooksTransgress] It wants to imagine trans\*formers otherwise, at a slant — for queerer systems (queer as in fuck you, as in QueerOS, as in queer-enough). 

[^hooksTransgress]: As in "teaching that enables transgressions – a movement against and beyond boundaries." @hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994

>"queer as [in] being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent, create and find a place to speak, and to thrive and to live"
>>—bell hooks

Trans\* can be inclusive, fluid, in motion, outside binary logics, self-identifying, evolving, emergent, embodied. Trans\*formative TechnoCraft imagines systems that might be the same, that trans\*cend the logics built up by capitalist, militaristic, racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages. 

This approach to technological trans\*lation and trans\*formation is without prerequisite. We are already queer-enough, coder-enough, valued-enough to participate in continually becoming. We are "always-already programming" 

#### \*

The asterisk after 'trans' longs for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming. It creates welcoming space for anyone who wonders if you are included, wonders what "this whole thing" is about (be it gender, sexuality, technology, other), wonders if you have anything to contribute. 

Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial. It is the footnote that defines our terms but and also it is the invitation to extend beyond any definition given. It is the multiplier and the instigator, the pivot and the punctum and the portal.

It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations, abstracted away.

The asterisk is risk (just a step), is star, is A-star pathfinding, ASCII joy, a wry smile, and a mark of possibility on a treasure map. 

#### Formative

<!-- Foundations -->

What is formative shapes us. These are the foundations we can't see, the scaffolding of our thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops of human networks, codified language, and rare earth.  

Each of these works asks: What are the foundational assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a dataset, a machine learning system, or programmers themselves? Of any technology or way of being? They tease out the metaphors applied and question what other metaphors make space for other forms.

<!-- Form Content Loops -->

Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can fill it. If I know how to make forms, or even platforms, not only content to plug in, I am more free to work the two in iterative, ongoing relation. This is how I knead the dough — form and content and form and content and form. 

In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make, through its insistence, resistence, grain. It in-forms itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. 

Computation requires information to take on its formation, its orderly fashion. It requires contortion to represent us. Sarah Sharma reminds the Broken Machines: "to represent is also to be filed away." [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020 ]To understand through computation is to reduce to logics of categorization. [@crawfordAtlasAIPower2021] This is why we must imagine new forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new forms. 

>"frictioned technologies" @hamraieCripTechnoscienceManifesto2019a

### Techno

Techno-solutionist... Techno-utopian... Techno-dystopian... 

Techno...music? Yes, always take dance breaks.

Techno means a plethora of prefix possibilities and digital-analog hybrids (think what "cyber-" was to the '90s). Also systems-oriented, bubbling science experiments, project-driven not damage-centered.

>"This possibility of creating directed, coordinated, and controlled sets of techniken that ensure a reliable link between the addressor and the addressee is the precondition of not only computing but also Althusserian interpellation. The technical conditions of various computational systems—analog, digital, or quantum thus turn out to be coterminous with the development of modern disciplinary states and their sociotechnicalities, and addressability emerges as a key shared operational logic." [@dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022]
>"This widespread technik of addressing underpins the whole landscape of computing and its imaginaries." Address means you are locatable in space, means you are reachable. [@dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022]

#### Key forms & foundational concepts of generative AI systems explained

- "Machine conditioning" not machine learning: "the fuzzy usage of ‘learning’ anthropomorphises a mathematical optimisation process" [@gaitelyriqueFrancisHungerUnHype2021]
- Replace neural metaphors: "Neurons" in neural networks are pre-set nodes that determine the weights and probabilities of information, ie *they do math.* The "brain" structure is a metaphor, what are other metaphors?
- Activation & loss
- Simplistic non-understanding:
  - "Given the statistical distribution of words in the vast public corpus of (English) text, what words are most likely to follow the sequence [...]? (Murray Shanahan (2022), "Talking About Large Language Models" @shanahanTalkingLargeLanguage2023)
- Vectors & Tensors: When you're a computer, everything's a number
- Models & Transformers: Encoding, Decoding
  - ML systems both create and interpret the numerical representations of information. 
- Semi/Un/Supervised depends on human labeling (see crowdwork below)
  - Was labeled, pre-sorted data used to train it? (Supervised) 
  - Or was the data unstructured, like plain text? (Unsupervised)
  - Unsupervised learning means data are even more essential to the models' outputs
- Complexity here is about scale: The speed and quantity of calculations that computation enables, NOT the complexity of those calculations themselves.
- Binaries & Booleans
  - Similarity & Difference
    - Often seen technically as a measure of "distance"
    - But of what "dimension" (aspect) and measured (represented numerically) in what way?
    - cosign similarity between the vectors (a function of the angle between the 2, cosign "normalizes" for scale)
    - What of the varied social understandings of similarity & difference?
  - Spatializing metaphors
  - "Grenzprobleme"
    - "Border problems" (via Pedro Oliveira)
    - "Our research shows that the BAMF's language analysis software makes mistakes - just like the people who use it."
    - Categorization is always a question of in/out-side. Concepts are codified through the creation and reproduction of these boundaries.

#### Classification logics

- Pervasive capture, data colonialism: 
  - >"the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction." (Nick Couldry & Ulises A. Mejias  [@couldryMakingDataColonialism2019])
- Garbage in, garbage out: 
  - Conscientious collection methods, values and questions 
  - Proprietary, missing, indecipherable data, practices and documentation
  - Labor:
    - "The data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour" [@ExclusiveHourWorkers]
    - "ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent,” Andrew Strait
    - "Automation runs on the averaged microjudgments of whole detachments of underpaid humans, not some supersmart computer." [Steyerl (2022) @steyerlMeanImages2023]
- Unacknowledged curation: 
  - >"All of these attempts to harmonize and create general descriptive languages are founded on a universalizing logic that in its most utopian dimensions believes that these political and infrastructural differences that stand in the way of classification are accidental and can ultimately be overcome." [Justin Joque (2015) @joqueDataCreationMeaning2015]
- Data bodies, algorithmic race & gender, the problem of representation: 
  - “your algorithmic gender may well contradict your own identity, needs, and values. Google’s gender is a gender of profitable convenience” (John Cheney-Lippold, We Are Data @cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017)
  - whose data are (not) included:
    - “we need to interrogate not only the security of our data but  [...] What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to [a boutique self-tracking device], the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?” (Jacqueline Wernimont, Numbered Lives @wernimontNumberedLivesLife2018)
    - whose stories are these? "what subject position allows us to ethically occupy, flourish, and move in a world of pervasive data monitoring? (Natasha Dow Schull)
- Worldbuilding with data: 
  - “Database design, in that way, is 'an exercise in worldbuilding,' a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views—a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race.” (Ruja Benjamin, Race After Technology @benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019)
- Uncertainty reduced to certainty 
  - "[The algorithm] presents something as a singular optimal output, when it is actually generated through multiple and contingent relations. [...] I understand the spatial logic of algorithms to be an arrangement of propositions that significantly generates what matters in the world." (Louise Amoore, Cloud Ethics @amooreCloudEthicsAlgorithms2020)
- Displaced agency, diffused responsibility
- Bias transfer:
  - "bias transfer both (a) arises in realistic settings (such as when pre-training on ImageNet or other standard datasets) and (b) can occur even when the target dataset is explicitly de-biased" @salmanWhenDoesBias2022


>"computers were humans (mostly women), and digital computers were primarily used for complex calculations, especially in wartime military contexts. Amid the ballistic calculations, Turing speculated on a prompt from his teacher, philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein: Can machines think? Both men thought it was a ridiculous question" @veeTextGenEdTeachingText2023

#### Tech is TechNO (Refusal, Tactical Media)

##### Extreme use
  * Lace cards
  * "Pranking an AI—giving it a task and watching it fail—is a great way to learn about it" —Janelle Shane
##### Desire lines, adversarial attacks, salt circles
##### Make your own systems
  * Coem, Katherine Yang (2022)

>"An anti-fascist approach to AI is a positive refusal, a rejection of certain forms of apparatus and a commitment to radical alternatives. [...] Our ambition should stretch beyond the timid idea of AI governance, which accepts what we’re already being subjected to, and instead look to transform our apparatuses into a technical practice that supports the common good." —Dan McQuinlin, Resisting AI @mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist


Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse their materials to engage political [potentials]. In her "Manifesto of the Broken Machine," Sarah Sharma shows how we might work *with* perceptions of [women and others as] outliers and errors, in order to work *against* the systems that frame them as such: **"A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves."** @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020

>As "an investment in a multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions," says Raley, "tactical media activities provide models of opposition rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau reminds us, 'itself remains intact.'" [@raleyTacticalMedia2009]

David Garcia and Geert Lovink describe tactical media as "An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike." [@garciaGarciaLovinkABC]

>"learning to inhabit the world in a better way [...] the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real" (Bourriaud in Raley Tactical Media)

>"the lesson I think we need to learn from tactical media practitioners more broadly is that critique and critical reflection are at their most powerful when they do not adopt a spectatorial position on the (putatively neutral) outside, when they do not merely sketch a surface, but rather penetrate the core of the system itself, intensifying identification so as to produce structural change." (Raley R. "Dataveillance and Countervailance in @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013)

#### NO to capital and YES to sharing

TechNO is also open-access, open-source — in their refusal to capitulate to capitalist regimes of encapsulation, privatization, knowledge-hoarding and gatekeeping. 


#### Tech is Techne

Tech begins with techne, begins with fiber, begins with the meshy matrix that sustains us. [@plantZerosOnes1998] Tech means any tool. It means not only clay tablets but language becoming discrete written letters instead of a chorus of breath. [@carsonErosBittersweetEssay2014]
It includes the histories of technology erased and rewritten by narratives of conquest and power [cite?]. It includes technologies of passing, of obfuscation, of survival. It includes [XXX]

Ursula M. Franklin sees technology as a practice, the way things are done, not only the tools with which they are done — a system that includes "far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004] She argues this show its deep link with culture. 
>"technology defined as practice shows us the deep cultural link of technology." // holistic / prescriptive technologies. 

Thinking of coding as craft moves it back into the realm of holistic technologies, focused on the practitioner, rather than prescriptive ones, focused on production, effectiveness, scale, and management. Franklin says prescriptive technologies, while often  "exceedingly effective and efficient, [...] come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it.'" Meanwhile holistic technologies require muscle memory and instinct; they allow the practitioner to "draw on their own experience, each time applying it to a unique situation." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004] 

<!-- Techne goes back to the earliest tools and humans' relationship with and manipulation of our environments.  -->

<!-- Luce Irigaray, Helene Cixous, Monique Wittig, Sadie Plant, and others write of the desirous techne body in various forms. The passing body, the  -->

**These are not metaphors but material, infrastructures undergirding systems that uphold power — woven into the warp and weft.**

>"This crude model of the user and the used has legitimized the scientific projects, colonial adventures, sexual relations, and even the artistic endeavors of the modern world. It continues to inform the deployment of even the most complex machines. [...] The user and the used are merely the perceptible elements, the identifiable components which are thrown up by-and serve also to contain-far more complex processes. The weaver and the loom, the surfer and the Net: none of them are anything without the engineerings which they both capture and perpetuate." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 77)

>"Written out of an official history which draws them in as its minor footnotes to itself, cloths, weavers, and their skills turn out to be far in advance of the art forms digitization supersedes." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 190)

>"as though all the ostensible reasons and motivations underlying their development had merely provided occasions for the emergence of a matrix which Gibson's novel was nudging into place; as though the present was being reeled into a future which had always been guiding the past, washing back over precedents completely unaware of its influence." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 13)

### Craft

##### Handcrafted & handicraft approaches
  * Agacency & the Internet of Towels, Anuradha Reddy
  * Leaking Subjects & Bounding Boxes: On Training AI, Elisa Giardina Papa (2022)
  * Google Maps Hack (Traffic Jam), Simon Weckert (2020)
  * Declassifier & Humans of AI, Phillip Schmitt (2019)
  * Sys server, feminist server manifesto, serve pub, "A Traversal Network of Feminist Servers"

>"rosa [travelling server] is not only constituted in hardware or sotware, but also the multitude of relations that are created around the making, maintaining and passing on of this infrastructure: the processes that are performed, the afective charge of their actioning, the community around them." @TraversalNetworkFeminista

##### Counterpublishing
  * Zines to clarify information [@VisualIntroductionAI]
  * Zines to make counterpublics
    * >"ways of thinking digitally about information were embedded in lesbian-feminist work with paper, in the ways lesbian feminists learned computing and imagined and built networks and databases for storing and sharing information"
    >>—Cait McKinney (2020) Information Activism (Image from ONE Archives queer zine collections) [@mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020]


* **craft**: material, iterative, process-oriented, handmade, embodied, tinkering



#### Hand scale, accessibility

Craft does not scale, but can be used in resistance to scale. Using handmade, hand labor is one very important tactic still available to tackle the seemingly insurmountable scale of giant datasets we are living under the regime of now. 

The anarchist's toolchest, simple tools known well. 

AI and knitting: Simple gestures repeated into habit, into complexity.

Craft suggests repair, and error, and air. 


#### A craft approach also organizes labor and relations differently. 

>"The alignment of craft and craftiness is perhaps the best location to find a unifying thread that runs throughout the diverse technical and ethical worlds of hacking. [...] all hackers fit the bill as quintessential “craftspeople,” [...] Even if craftspeople tend to work in solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on shared rules of engagement and standards for quality." 
>>"Intellectual guile" (outside the box)
>>"Craftiness, then, can be seen as thinking outside the box, or circumvention of inherent technological limitations in pursuit of craft. But we can also understand craftiness as exceeding mere instrumentality."
Coleman aligns hackers with crafts guilds. Requires "intellectual guile"
>[@colemanHackers2016]

**TechnoCraft** honors historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft — which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community — and aligns them with the aspects of technology which get overlooked: namely, the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the global majority. 




#### Counter histories

[Black Gooey Universe]

>Core rope memory [From the Sasha](https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/from-the-sasha-into-the-zamani-death-as-a-moment-of-radical-continuity/) "During the pioneering of the Apollo spacecraft mission, women workers manually wove memory into computer systems, translating software programmed by MIT engineers into physical binaries. The first woman to do this was Hilda G. Carpenter, a Black lab technician who advanced the methods that would ultimately be used to land Apollo missions on the moon. These threading techniques, referred to as “core rope memory” and “magnetic core memory,” were laborious processes of physically coding information into machines using ferrite rings and copper wire to control the flow of electricity"

>"they process and store data. Because there is no difference between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous. (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 66)

>"weaving wends its way through even the media which supplant it. While paper has lost its associations with the woven fabrics with which it began, there are .remnants of weaving in all writing: yarns continue to be spun, texts are still abbreviated textiles, and even grammarglamor-and spelling retain an occult connectivity. Silkscreens, printing presses, stencils, photographic processes, and typewriters: by the end of the nineteenth century images, texts, and patterns of all kinds were being processed by machines which still used matrices as means to their ends," (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 69)

#### What craft allows

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one's expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices." (Anuradha Reddy, Digital Creativity, 2022 "The Internet of Towels (2022) @reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022)
>"hybridizing or taking apart AI systems through material translations and free associations [...] these artefacts do not carry out the work of reconstructing or stitching back together what has been taken apart or hybridized by artificial everyday creativity" [@reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022]

#### Craft means taking care and care-taking

- Queer zine and newsletter networks
>"lesbian-feminist information infrastructures are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions."
[@mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020]

- Feminist server art

>"The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care, but also to generate care. [...] In the perspective proposed here, generating care means counting in participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of understanding."
>>[@delabellacasaMattersCareTechnoscience2011]

>"All kinds of infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor, [...and] their study can more precisely be understood as a concern of *feminist* aesthetics in particular." —Ines Kleesattel, Situated Aesthetics for Relational Critique: On Messy Entanglements from Maintenance Art to Feminist Server Art in [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]

Sustaining feminst servers takes "years of intense collective learning" (Kleesattel [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]). "Tensions, ambivalences and immanent differences are uncomfortable and messy—and precisely therefore crucial for [...] Feminist Server Art," says Kleesattel. It holds "interrelated dimensions of actual hardware and software, common infrastructures, limited resources, care- and service labors, more-than-human poetics and speculative fabulations."

### Re-mixed material metaphors

>"Careful slugs, crying sabotage"
>""CS (Careful Slugs) can be a form of failure less closely tied to action."
>""[to create] speculative fictions for CS––Careful Slugs stories that reconfigure relations and introduce scandals and chances into Computer Science, Design, and STS processes that might lead to other sorts of project plans, research questions, and technical inquiries." 
>"the use of metaphors in breaching that break through gaps in walls, barriers, and surfaces of the structurally violent world that we are in. Rather than only noticing the practices of technoscience and remaking it for better worlds, we call for queer playfulness and promiscuous metaphorical practice."

## def main(): What's Included

Each section of Trans\*formative TechnoCraft offers an enactment of this thinking from a different angle, combining to enact the ethics and tactics described above. Together these public-facing resources attempt to provide plainspoken translations of technical, aesthetic, and ethical concepts in approachable zine formats, in order to support both AI insiders and marginalized outsiders in understanding the urgency of the issues facing automated technologies and the necessity of each other’s skill sets in facing those issue. 

The research foundational to this artistic practice is a critical reflection on the technical aspects of natural language processing and dataset processing techniques that support the latest systems, while situating their cultural and material antecedents through lenses of power. 

### CRAFT: *Coding.Care*

In *Coding.Care* I detail five years of engaging [XXX]

>Code Collective is a distinctive community of practice and pedagogical space that welcomes and supports many kinds of learners. For almost five years, this diverse hack lab has hosted workshops and hybrid-format meetings, while growing and shifting to meet the needs of our community—from pandemic support to alumni programming. The Collective unites students who may have zero technical experience with those who have lots—and values their experiences equally, with the mantra: "We all have something to teach each other." Through the Collective’s intimidation-free, learner-led, process-oriented approach, it theorizes and models caring community building and innovative university lab space, plus non-academic community workshops that can create knowledge transfer across disciplinary and social strata of all kinds. 
*I have adapted this format to guest faculty roles and workshops at Ars Electronica, Transmediale, Mozilla Festival, Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, and elsewhere.* 

*Coding.Care* offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. It focuses on Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in early 2019 for emerging media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Here, we see creative-critical code as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its <span class="purple">guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition."</span> It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now 3+ years-old community, like how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methods from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work. <span class="purple">Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</span>

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an <span class="purple">ethics of coding care</span>—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: "We all have something to teach each other." Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly "anyone can join." Rather, Coding.Care reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.

### FORMATIVE: *A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets* and *Inclusive Datasets Research Guide*

>*A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets* is a practical in-depth guide for navigating giant datasets and the implications of their use. It distills the complex aspects of working with datasets into easily graspable terms.

LEARNING GOALS: Through the Critical Field Guide, understand the training datasets and how to work with them before they become models. 


### * : *Interstitial Portals*

Analogue pre-responses to AI systems by 20th century media artists, and my responses to them: 

- No Knots, Only Loops // Rebecca Horn
- ?? which work ?? // Sophie Calle? VALLIE EXPORT? Adrian Piper? Sonya Rapoport? Lynne Hershmann? Hito Steyerl?

Analogue ritual practices of data collection and queer feminist body art show where "data wiggle room" was already wide, and they help me reimagine how I encounter data now.

(BIAS CUTS)

What can happen when we acknowledge bias rather than try to "optimize" it out?

When we work with and against our artistic materials? 

### TECH: *The Intersectional AI Toolkit*

>The Toolkit gathers and synthesizes aspects of queer theory, Black feminism, transfeminisms, and decolonial perspectives that can contribute valuable lenses for machine learning’s most pressing problems. It celebrates work done by other intersectional researchers and artists working to address these issues in many fields. And it is one of the few resources to clarify, without math or jargon, the inner workings of AI and how they always operate as sociotechnical systems. As a digital platform, it creates a forum for others to expand upon the work; and through in-person and hybrid-online workshops, it invites a variety of communities to participate directly in the systems that impact them.

LEARNING GOALS: Through the Intersectional AI Toolkit, understand the models, architectures, systems, hype. Understand the necessity of plural perspectives.

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.

<!-- Broadly these have been called data subjects. For clarity, I distinguish between data subjects, whose information is captured in datasets that train machine learning models, and data subjectees, who are interpellated by and bear the impact of those models when implemented as part of AI systems. We are all the sovereign Data State's subjects, and we are all subject to its gaze as data subjectees.  -->
