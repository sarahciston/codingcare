# Trans*formative Tech(no)craft


To build safer, more equitable AI systems, we need stronger creative–critical coding communities. To build these communities, we need approachable, critical perspectives on AI systems. Both efforts cannot exist without each other.

## Creative–Critical–Care Entanglements

Trans*formational TechnoCraft argues for the essential entanglement of critical AI and creative-critical coding communities, showing how each is predicated on the other. No intervention in disproportionately harmful automated systems is possible without critically aware approaches to technologies from deeply plural perspectives. No such proliferation of perspectives is possible without inviting spaces to understand, interrogate, and reimagine the infrastructures that support those systems. 

These public-facing resources provide accessible translations of technical, aesthetic, and ethical concepts, in approachable zine formats, in order to support both AI insiders and marginalized outsiders understanding the necessity of each other’s skill sets. 

The research foundational to this artistic practice is a critical reflection on the technical aspects of natural language processing and dataset processing techniques that support the latest systems, while situating their cultural and material antecedents through lenses of power.

### We Need Intersectional Critical AI 

<!-- #### Data subjectees -->

Many have written about the 


>"Questions like 'is a computer creative' or 'is a computer an artist' or the like should not be considered serious questions, period. In the light of the problems we are facing at the end of the 20th century, those are irrelevant questions. Computers can and should be used in art in order to draw attention to new circumstances and connections and to forget 'art'." (Frieder Nake "There Should Be No Computer Art" 1971) 

Such questions about labor and creativity in relation to AI are fundamentally questions trying to define humanity — *What makes us creative or empathetic? What makes us different from machines? What makes us human?* Therefore such questions also emerge from centuries of colonialized framings of 'man' and the idealized, individual white western subject. Hyped AI discourse explores limited questions about AI because it continues to draw from limited perspectives, letting status quo narratives about humans and automated systems frame the terms of debate. 

AI hype describes machine learning systems as impenetrable black boxes. It designs the interfaces with which we engage its tools, it claims the proprietary restrictions that hide its data (our data), and it influences the regulations that keep its power in the hands of a limited few. 




We are subject to it whenever we lend our data by clicking terms of service pop-ups to make them go away and whenever we pass through borders, banks, and bureaucracies of any kind. [XXX][surveillance capitalism, ariana's work]



Broadly we call these data subjects. I distinguish between data subjects, whose information is captured in datasets that train machine learning models, and data subjectees, who are interpellated by and bear the impact of those models when implemented as part of AI systems. In the sovereignty sense, we are all subjects of the Data State, and we are all subject to its gaze as data subjectees. 


>"We must begin with the knowledge that new technologies will not simply redistribute power equitably within already established hierarchies of difference. The idea that they will is the stuff of utopian naivete and technological determinism that got us here to begin with. The Broken Machine should not be understood as a new technology. It is not an upgrade to an older model or a feminist design solution." @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020



<!-- #### What is Intersectional Critical AI -->

Automated decision-making systems disproportionately harm the marginalized majority. The task of Critical AI researchers and makers is to engage these systems as sociotechncial objects embedded in their historical, social, context. We must be "situated in proximity to the thing itself, cultivating some degree of participatory and embodied expertise, whether archival, ethnographic, or applied (Raley & Rhee, 2022 @raleyCriticalAIField2023). This requires interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives. 

Kimberlé Crenshaw's iconic analysis of power: @crenshawDemarginalizingIntersectionRace1989
Intersectionality "examines and critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally." @cooperIntersectionality2016


As industry implementations of so-called intersectional tech reduce these complex concepts into flattened ideas of fairness and representation @ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a, we need multimodal, polyvocal, experimental approaches that cut through the technological solutionism. @cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019 


#### We Need Creative–Critical–Caring Approaches 

Caring, creative, and critical approaches must be combined in order to adapt the spaces where technologies are discussed, designed, and implemented. Those spaces are missing the essential perspective of those most at the margins who are most capable of addressing the urgent issues 

<!-- #### Artistic experimentation -->

I’m interested in how artistic experiments can challenge paradigms in machine learning, data science, and technology more broadly. 

I have found artistic research practices can interrogate systems and imagine new ones. For me, it combines rigorous scholarly investigation, deep community building and activism, and creative play in ways that can connect to broader non-academic audiences. 

Art has been the space where I’m able to unpack complex ideas for myself, because I can treat them more freely as artistic materials. It’s where I’m able to follow instinct and feel into how my tools, platforms, and forms shape their outputs and outcomes. 

It’s also the space where I feel able to imagine wildly, creating digital objects that should exist but don’t, or couldn’t exist but might. In my experience, this imaginative work is central to supporting very practical next steps and strategies. It is central to supporting more open access to communities of practice where others can continue the kinds of artistic experimentation that challenge paradigms in new forms I might never imagine.


## Trans\*formative

Trans\*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It means justice-oriented, community-oriented, process-oriented practices. 

'Transformative' includes transformative justice, a movement which recognizes that oppression is at the root of harmful technological systems and argues that acknowledging this oppression is essential to addressing it. It moves beyond punative, carceral logics to imagine and create different, even healing systems [cite]. Reparative and restorative acts are part of this work, but the terms 'reparative' and 'restorative' in relationship to justice movements and to LGBT histories are fraught. Instead I find the broader sense of 'transformative' resonates for me with trans\*, intersectional, and inclusive approaches to identities and [politics][— as well as to this project, its participants, its influences, and its intentions].

Trans\*formative is an active, prefigurative [footnote] stance, meant to [XXXX WHAT ELSE DOES TRANSFORMATIVE DO?] 

#### Transformers

Transformers are the kinds of machine learning architectures currently being employed to create large language models. They are good at digesting large clumps of text, images, video (each as numbers) and reconstituting them. Their parts are called encoders and decoders, and it's often said that we don't know what exactly is going on in these hidden layers. But I think it is more interesting that *they* do not know what is going on in these hidden layers of their own architecture. While they process and produce meaning (input and output), they are not "aware" of the meaning of the content they are processing along the way. 

Transformers are the latest, but won't be the last, in a long string of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees to submit to their "superior" logics. With every iteration on their forms, we repeat their hype but lose trace of their histories in "race science" and colonizing power that captures what it means to know and be known. 

The paper that launched a thousand transformer models was called "Attention Is All You Need." Transformer language models incorporate context through a mechanism called "self-attention" that examines the word-units surrounding each word-unit they interpret. We need more than self-attention. We need self-reflection and co-regulation. We need systems that, in their very architectures, celebrate difference rather than erase it.  

#### Trans\*

To move from the "transformer" model architecture to trans*formative tech and technocraft means to acknowledge the requisite entanglement of community building and [critical sociotechnical systems]. It means knowing the material we are transforming — by sharing in it, speaking nearby, walking beside, realizing what of it constitutes us or supports us.

This work is about trans\*lation and trans\*formation. It wants to imagine trans\*formers otherwise, at a slant — for queerer systems (queer as in fuck you, as in QueerOS, as in queer-enough). 

>"queer as [in] being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent, create and find a place to speak, and to thrive and to live"
>>—bell hooks

Trans\* can be inclusive, fluid, in motion, outside binary logics, self-identifying, evolving, emergent, embodied. Trans\*formative TechnoCraft imagines systems that might be the same, that trans\*cend the logics built up by capitalist, militaristic, racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages. 

This approach to technological trans\*lation and trans\*formation is without prerequisite. We are already queer-enough, coder-enough, valued-enough to participate in continually becoming. We are "always-already programming" 

#### \*

The asterisk after 'trans' longs for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming. It creates welcoming space for anyone who wonders if you are included, wonders what "this whole thing" is about (be it gender, sexuality, technology, other), wonders if you have anything to contribute. 

Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial. It is the footnote that defines our terms but and also it is the invitation to extend beyond any definition given. It is the multiplier and the instigator, the pivot and the punctum and the portal.

It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations, abstracted away.

The asterisk is risk (just a step), is star, is A-star pathfinding, ASCII joy, a wry smile, and a mark of possibility on a treasure map. 

#### Formative

<!-- Foundations -->

What is formative shapes us. These are the foundations we can't see, the scaffolding of our thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops of human networks, codified language, and rare earth.  

Each of these works asks: What are the foundational assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a dataset, a machine learning system, or programmers themselves? Of any technology or way of being? They tease out the metaphors applied and question what other metaphors make space for other forms.

<!-- Form Content Loops -->

Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can fill it. If I know how to make forms, or even platforms, not only content to plug in, I am more free to work the two in iterative, ongoing relation. This is how I knead the dough — form and content and form and content and form. 

In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make, through its insistence, resistence, grain. It in-forms itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. 

Computation requires information to take on its formation, its orderly fashion. It requires contortion to represent us. Sarah Sharma reminds the Broken Machines: "to represent is also to be filed away." @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020 To understand through computation is to reduce to logics of categorization. @crawfordAtlasAIPower2021 This is why we must imagine new forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new forms. 

## Techno

Techno-solutionist
Techno-utopian
Just Techno

Yes, also let's dance. Always take dance breaks.


#### Tech is TechNO (refusal)

>"This possibility of creating directed, coordinated, and controlled sets of techniken that ensure a reliable link between the addressor and the addressee is the precondition of not only computing but also Althusserian interpellation. The technical conditions of various computational systems—analog, digital, or quantumthus turn out to be coterminous with the development of modern disciplinary states and their sociotechnicalities, and addressability emerges as a key shared operational logic." @dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022
>"This widespread technik of addressing underpins the whole landscape of computing and its imaginaries." Address means you are locatable in space, means you are reachable. @dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022

>"An anti-fascist approach to AI is a positive refusal, a rejection of certain forms of apparatus and a commitment to radical alternatives. [...] Our ambition should stretch beyond the timid idea of AI governance, which accepts what we’re already being subjected to, and instead look to transform our apparatuses into a technical practice that supports the common good." —Dan McQuinlin, Resisting AI @mcquillanResistingAIAntifascist



#### Tech is Techne (making, fibre, self-actual, muscle knowledge)

Irigaray, Cixous, Wittig, Plant write of the desirous techne body in various forms. The passing body, the 

Tech begins with techne begins with fiber, begins with the meshy matrix that sustains us. Tech means any tool. 

**These are not metaphors but material, infrastructures undergirding systems that uphold power — woven into the warp and weft.**

>"This crude model of the user and the used has legitimized the scientific projects, colonial adventures, sexual relations, and even the artistic endeavors of the modern world. It continues to inform the deployment of even the most complex machines. [...] The user and the used are merely the perceptible elements, the identifiable components which are thrown up by-and serve also to contain-far more complex processes. The weaver and the loom, the surfer and the Net: none of them are anything without the engineerings which they both capture and perpetuate." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 77)

>"Written out of an official history which draws them in as its minor footnotes to itself, cloths, weavers, and their skills turn out to be far in advance of the art forms digitization supersedes." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 190)

>"as though all the ostensible reasons and motivations underlying their development had merely provided occasions for the emergence of a matrix which Gibson's novel was nudging into place; as though the present was being reeled into a future which had always been guiding the past, washing back over precedents completely unaware of its influence." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 13)

## Craft

And **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft — which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community — with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the global majority, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne. 

Processing (rather than programming)

The term **processing** as well, interchangeable here with programming, speaks to a more embodied crossover, a working-through of personal and communal and generational trauma. I'm interested in how these terms slip-slide around each other poetically, when thinking of the Central Processing Unit of a person or a digital device.  

#### Techno


### Hand scale, accessibility

Craft does not scale, but can be used in resistance to scale. Using handmade, hand labor is one very important tactic still available to tackle the seemingly insurmountable scale of giant datasets we are living under the regime of now. 

**The toolchest, the repetition into habit. **


#### A craft approach also organizes labor and relations differently. 

>"The alignment of craft and craftiness is perhaps the best location to find a unifying thread that runs throughout the diverse technical and ethical worlds of hacking. [...] all hackers fit the bill as quintessential “craftspeople,” [...] Even if craftspeople tend to work in solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on shared rules of engagement and standards for quality." 
>>"Intellectual guile" (outside the box)
>>"Craftiness, then, can be seen as thinking outside the box, or circumvention of inherent technological limitations in pursuit of craft. But we can also understand craftiness as exceeding mere instrumentality."
Coleman aligns hackers with crafts guilds. Requires "intellectual guile"
>@colemanHackers2016

#### Counter histories

>"Weaving was already multimedia: singing, chanting, telling stories, dancing, and playing games as they work, spinsters, weavers, and needleworkers were literally networkers as well." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 65)

>"they process and store data. Because there is no difference between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous. (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 66)

>"weaving wends its way through even the media which supplant it. While paper has lost its associations with the woven fabrics with which it began, there are .remnants of weaving in all writing: yarns continue to be spun, texts are still abbreviated textiles, and even grammarglamor-and spelling retain an occult connectivity. Silkscreens, printing presses, stencils, photographic processes, and typewriters: by the end of the nineteenth century images, texts, and patterns of all kinds were being processed by machines which still used matrices as means to their ends," (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 69)

#### What craft allows

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one's expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices." (Anuradha Reddy, Digital Creativity, 2022 "The Internet of Towels (2022) @reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022)
>"hybridizing or taking apart AI systems through material translations and free associations [...] these artefacts do not carry out the work of reconstructing or stitching back together what has been taken apart or hybridized by artificial everyday creativity" @reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022

#### Craft means taking care and care-taking

- Queer zine and newsletter networks
>"lesbian-feminist information infrastructures are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions."
>"ways of thinking digitally about information were embedded in lesbian-feminist work with paper, in the ways lesbian feminists learned computing and imagined and built networks and databases for storing and sharing information"
>>—Cait McKinney (2020) Information Activism (Image from ONE Archives queer zine collections) @mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020

- Feminist server art

>"The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care, but also to generate care. [...] In the perspective proposed here, generating care means counting in participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of understanding."
>>@delabellacasaMattersCareTechnoscience2011

>"All kinds of infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor, [...and] their study can more precisely be understood as a concern of *feminist* aesthetics in particular." —Ines Kleesattel, Situated Aesthetics for Relational Critique: On Messy Entanglements from Maintenance Art to Feminist Server Art in @sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021

Sustaining feminst servers takes "years of intense collective learning" (Kleesattel @sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021). "Tensions, ambivalences and immanent differences are uncomfortable and messy—and precisely therefore crucial for [...] Feminist Server Art," says Kleesattel. It holds "interrelated dimensions of actual hardware and software, common infrastructures, limited resources, care- and service labors, more-than-human poetics and speculative fabulations."

### Re-mixed material metaphors

>"Careful slugs, crying sabotage"

>"the use of metaphors in breaching that break through gaps in walls, barriers, and surfaces of the structurally violent world that we are in. Rather than only noticing the practices of technoscience and remaking it for better worlds, we call for queer playfulness and promiscuous metaphorical practice." 
>>—Ren Loren Britton and Helen V. Pritchard, 2022

Each section of this assemblage offers an enactment of this thinking from a different angle. 
### CRAFT: *Coding.Care*

>Code Collective is a distinctive community of practice and pedagogical space that welcomes and supports many kinds of learners. For almost five years, this diverse hack lab has hosted workshops and hybrid-format meetings, while growing and shifting to meet the needs of our community—from pandemic support to alumni programming. The Collective unites students who may have zero technical experience with those who have lots—and values their experiences equally, with the mantra: "We all have something to teach each other." Through the Collective’s intimidation-free, learner-led, process-oriented approach, it theorizes and models caring community building and innovative university lab space, plus non-academic community workshops that can create knowledge transfer across disciplinary and social strata of all kinds. 
*Ciston has adapted this pedagogical model into guest faculty roles and workshops at Ars Electronica, Transmediale, Mozilla Festival, Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, and elsewhere.* 

LEARNING GOALS: Through Coding Care, understand how to  

### FORMATIVE: *A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets*

>*A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets* is a practical in-depth guide for navigating giant datasets and the implications of their use. It distills the complex aspects of working with datasets into easily graspable terms.

LEARNING GOALS: Through the Critical Field Guide, understand the training datasets and how to work with them before they become models. 


### * : *Interstitial Portals*

Analogue pre-responses to AI systems by 20th century media artists, and my responses to them: 

- No Knots, Only Loops // Rebecca Horn
- ?? // Hito Steyerl? Adrian Piper? Sophie Calle? Sonya Rapoport? Lynne Hershmann? 

### TECH: *The Intersectional AI Toolkit*

>The Toolkit gathers and synthesizes aspects of queer theory, Black feminism, transfeminisms, and decolonial perspectives that can contribute valuable lenses for machine learning’s most pressing problems. It celebrates work done by other intersectional researchers and artists working to address these issues in many fields. And it is one of the few resources to clarify, without math or jargon, the inner workings of AI and how they always operate as sociotechnical systems. As a digital platform, it creates a forum for others to expand upon the work; and through in-person and hybrid-online workshops, it invites a variety of communities to participate directly in the systems that impact them.

LEARNING GOALS: Through the Intersectional AI Toolkit, understand the models, architectures, systems, hype. Understand the necessity of plural perspectives.


### NO: *Tactical Refusals & Reverse Portals*

Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse their materials to engage political [potentials]. In her "Manifesto of the Broken Machine," Sarah Sharma shows how we might work *with* perceptions of [women and others as] outliers and errors, in order to work *against* the systems that frame them as such: **"A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves."** @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020

>As "an investment in a multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions" "tactical media activities provide models of opposition rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau reminds us, 'itself remains intact.'" @raleyTacticalMedia2009

David Garcia and Geert Lovink describe tactical media as "An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike." @garciaGarciaLovinkABC

>"learning to inhabit the world in a better way [...] the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real" (Bourriaud in Raley Tactical Media)

>"the lesson I think we need to learn from tactical media practitioners more broadly is that critique and critical reflection are at their most powerful when they do not adopt a spectatorial position on the (putatively neutral) outside, when they do not merely sketch a surface, but rather penetrate the core of the system itself, intensifying identification so as to produce structural change." (Raley R. "Dataveillance and Countervailance in @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013)

>"Interventionist art projects such as these work directly against the forces of interpellation with a counterimage of a dataveillance regime that makes that regime perceptible—and if it is perceptible then it becomes possible to work concretely toward political transformation." (Raley R. "Dataveillance and Countervailance in @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013)

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.
