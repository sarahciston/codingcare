# Trans*formative TechnoCraft

To build safer, more

## Creative–Critical–Care Entanglements

Trans*formative TechnoCraft argues for the essential entanglement of critical AI and creative-critical coding communities, showing how each is predicated on the other. No intervention in disproportionately harmful algorithmic systems is possible without critically aware approaches to technologies from deeply plural perspectives. No such proliferation of perspectives is possible without inviting spaces to understand, interrogate, and reimagine the infrastructures that support those systems. 

>"Anyone who has ever woven or knitted knows that one can change patterns [...] but, more importantly, they know *there are other patterns*. The web of technology can indeed be woven differently, but even to discuss such intentional changes of pattern requires an examination of the features of the current pattern and an understanding of the origins and the purpose of the present design." 
>>—Ursula M. Franklin ([@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004])

Yet, how do we participate on our own terms, in order to change systems to suit us? Especially when <span class="purple">learning programming is so often intimidating and riddled with false starts,</span> which can further marginalize those whose perspectives are most necessary in order to face the challenges technoculture presents. 

### We Need Intersectional Critical AI 

>"I’m stuck here inputting and outputting the data of a story I can’t change." 
>>(Italo Calvino "The Burning of the Abominable House" 1976, trans. 1995)

With every hype, the anti-hype: 

>"Questions like 'is a computer creative' or 'is a computer an artist' or the like should not be considered serious questions, period. In the light of the problems we are facing at the end of the 20th century, those are irrelevant questions. Computers can and should be used in art in order to draw attention to new circumstances and connections and to forget 'art'." 
>>(Frieder Nake 1971) 

Questions about art, creativity, and labor in relation to AI are fundamentally questions trying to define humanity — *What makes us creative or empathetic? What makes us different from machines? What makes us human?* They are old, old questions. They also emerge from centuries of colonialized framings of 'man' as an idealized, individual white western subject. Hyped AI discourse explores limited questions about AI because it continues to draw from limited perspectives, letting status quo narratives about humans and automated systems frame the terms of debate. 

AI hype describes machine learning systems as impenetrable black boxes. It designs the interfaces with which we engage its tools, it claims the proprietary restrictions that hide its data (our data), and it influences the regulations that keep its power in the hands of a select few. We only break out of those boxes when we refuse to engage on those terms. 

>Kate Crawford argues that computational "ways of seeing depend on the twin moves of abstraction and extraction. But these logics can be challenged, just as systems that perpetuate oppression can be rejected."

Automated decision-making systems disproportionately harm the marginalized majority. We are subject to it whenever we lend our data by clicking terms of service pop-ups to make them go away and whenever we must be recognized by borders, banks, and bureaucracies of any kind. Our vulnerability in these moments is exploited and profited on — from testing biometric facial technologies in refugee camps [@neddenBiometrieGetestetMillionen2017] to reinforcement learning reliant on AI chatbot user responses. Many amazing researchers have highlighted the increasing impacts of AI systems and surveillance capitalism [footnote cite Browne, Gebru, et al]. 

The task of Critical AI researchers and makers is to engage these systems as sociotechncial objects embedded in their historical, social, context. We must be "situated in proximity to the thing itself, cultivating some degree of participatory and embodied expertise, whether archival, ethnographic, or applied (Raley & Rhee, 2022 [@raleyCriticalAIField2023]). This requires interdisciplinary and intersectional perspectives. 

Kimberlé Crenshaw's iconic analysis of power, called Intersectionality,[@crenshawDemarginalizingIntersectionRace1989] "critiques systems of power and how those systems structure themselves to impact groups and individuals unequally." [@cooperIntersectionality2016] 

Intersectionality can reveal the human costs of finding ourselves caught within these algorithmic systems – their proliferating data and supporting material infrastructures, as well as their consolidating power and supporting sociocultural infrastructures. Their power is differential by design. Conversations about AI fairness, transparency, explainability, ethics, public good, and the various hype cycles of each new technology are grossly incomplete without intersectional analyses of power and intersectional tactics of (and beyond) equity and inclusion. No change *about* us *without* us. 

As industry implementations of so-called intersectional tech reduce these complex concepts into flattened ideas of fairness and representation [@ovalleFactoringMatrixDomination2023a], we need multimodal, polyvocal, experimental approaches that cut through the technological solutionism. [@cistonIntersectionalAIEssential2019] 

>"We must begin with the knowledge that new technologies will not simply redistribute power equitably within already established hierarchies of difference. The idea that they will is the stuff of utopian naivete and technological determinism that got us here to begin with. The Broken Machine should not be understood as a new technology. It is not an upgrade to an older model or a feminist design solution." [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020]

### We Need Creative–Critical–Caring Approaches 

How do we reconnect the communities of practice who are building technologies and those who are equipped with the knowledge to consider its most urgent questions? 

Caring, creative, and critical approaches must be combined in order to adapt the spaces where technologies are discussed, designed, and implemented. Those spaces are missing the essential perspective of those most at the margins, who are most capable of addressing the urgent issues facing technology. These concerns are not new, nor strictly digital. They have been addressed by a wide range of communities with different types of knowledge for centuries. Many are calling for that knowledge to be applied here. [cite][indigenous, queer, other applications of AI]

Yet intimidating, isolating cultures around the specialization of computation and programming practices have left so many of us out of these conversations. [cite][Vee, Abbate, Hicks] 

How do we reunite? 

We need access. We need our contributions to be valued, for the effort toward understanding to be mutual because all participants know we all have important contributions to make. 

Access includes many aspects. It requires connecting an individual's current understanding and circumstances to the [item in question]. It considers like material, financial, intellectual, social resources that allow entry points. 

I may be capable of understanding how a machine learning system works, but not have the prerequisite vocabulary to enter a conversation in order to learn about it. 

I may understand how to operate a machine learning system, but not have the financial resources needed to run a resource-intensive devices in order to use one.

I may have knowledge and resources to share, but not be able to participate because barrier-free access, transcription, gender-inclusive language, or other inclusive aspects were not prioritized by the organizers. 



>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public." 
>>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

These works are written as jargon-free as possible to allow them to travel as broadly as possible. While 

#### Creative-critical-code: holistic approaches

Care means critical.

All writing is a hybrid practice of creation (poetics), critique (politics), and code (platforms and programmatic systems). All code is writing and all writing is code. 

>"any theory that cannot be shared in everyday conversation cannot be used to educate the public."

>"By reinforcing the idea that there is a split between theory and practice or by creating such a split, both groups [elite academia and anti-intellectuals] deny the power of liberatory education for critical consciousness, thereby perpetuating conditions that reinforce our collective exploitation and repression.
>>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

>"Theory is not inherently healing, liberatory, or revolutionary. lt fulfills this function only when we ask that it do so and direct our theorizing towards this end." >>–bell hooks [-@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]


It requires we reunite the divisions between theory and practice, between user and programmer, which were artificially split from the start. [XXXexplain] [^hoff] [^nardi] [^americanartist] It requires un-siloing of domains and disciplines, the artificial boundaries that divide technologists from activists. 

It requires we find common language, common value/appreciation/respect that comes with working knowledge of the whole working system. 

**The technical means how (coding skills) and the critical/analytical means how (analytical, political, aesthetic, ethical contexts) and the material means how (data, energy, hardware) have to combine / are inseparable.**

#### Approachable, accessible // Care means access


#### Research tensions

To sit a bit longer with questions I know I cannot answer, questions that make me uneasy. To hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously and let their magnetic energy push-pull me. To forgive myself the imperative outcomes, the productivity, the proven hypothesis, the subject of research. To put myself into the trouble too, because I already embody these questions in lived experience.

#### Artistic experimentation

>"Bots can make arguments. [...] Bots are a strategy deployed in particular circumstances, and they are frequently deployed as a folk practice, outside of 'mainstream' practices of artists, academics, researchers, engineers, etc. [...] bots are a way of working against the accepted uses or potentially damaging affordances of a particular platform. bots are a way of embodying certain kinds of unauthorized and semi-authorized uses of those spaces. [...] bots exist to shine a light on how things already work, but also to test the edge cases, and to propose alternatives. [...] bots are procedures against procedures." -Allison Parrish, "Procedure vs Procedure"

The case for combining creative and critical practices is already strong, and has been made elsewhere by many [XXXexpand][cite]. I am interested in how this work shows up as experimentation and particularly in how artistic experiments can challenge paradigms in machine learning, data science, and technology more broadly. 

I have found artistic research practices can interrogate systems and imagine new ones. For me, it combines rigorous scholarly investigation, deep community building and activism, and creative play in ways that can connect to broader non-academic audiences. 

Art has been the space where I’m able to unpack complex ideas for myself, because I can treat them more freely as artistic materials. It’s where I’m able to follow instinct and feel into how my tools, platforms, and forms shape their outputs and outcomes. 

It’s also the space where I feel able to imagine wildly, creating digital objects that should exist but don’t, or couldn’t exist but might. In my experience, this imaginative work is central to supporting very practical next steps and strategies. It is central to supporting more open access to communities of practice where others can continue the kinds of artistic experimentation that challenge paradigms in new forms I might never imagine.
 
This is a practice of artistic research, research-creation, and/or arts-based research (different lineages and regions call it by different names)[cite] [@lovelessHowMakeArt2019]. 

>"Specifically the "valences" of research-creation [Chapman & Sawchuk] that are not "creative presentation of research" (reporting on research in creative ways), or "research for creation" that supports a stand-alone artwork, or "research from creation" (reporting about artworks after the fact), but rather "creation-as-research" [and I'd add research-as-creation], which Loveless says "Research-creation [...] produces hybrid forms, defamiliarizing and uncanny, that oscillate between more than one 'species' of production and that result in 'offspring' that are often unthinkable, illegible within the current institutional frameworks of academia. It creates a chimera. By bringing research and creation together in such a way that they unpredictably contaminate and remake each other,"

>"in failing to fully belong, and allowing that nonbelonging to denaturalize, emergently, its givens, research-creation tells other stories, uncanny stories, that (have the potential to) carry within them the other ethics that King invites us to attend to."


>"The experience of artists reinforces a point we have each separately argued elsewhere: that abstract ethics conversations are a necessary but not sufficient condition for progressive politics around digital technologies and that everyday digital practice is the terrain around which broader ethical and political ends must be staked out." (Stark & Crawford 2019, 452)
>"artists saw value in reaching shared normative practices through engagement between artists and audiences, suggesting a model for participation and collaboration often missing in other forms of digital research and development.(Stark & Crawford 2019, 45 [@starkWorkArtAge2019]

#### These approaches are entangled

Dunbar-Hester and others call for interventions that go deeper than training more people in tech jobs, pointing out that this does little to examine the structures that organize and value work sectors out of balance. She argues this calls for
>"a larger reevaluation and appropriation of categories themselves—the boundaries of what is 'social' and what is 'technical' are flexible categories" @dunbar-hesterHackingDiversityPolitics2019
>"Voluntaristic technology communities are important sites because they are utopian spaces where people play and tinker not only with technical artifacts but with social reality, imagining social relations through participation"

DH: not about diversity in tech directly, aim at broader social goals of [e.g. decolonization, ecological sustainability, distribution of wealth] which would necessitate changes in tech sector.

## What Is Trans\*formative TechnoCraft?

### Trans\*formative

Trans\*formative here means emergent, embodied, embedded practices. It means process-oriented, community-oriented practices. It means making space for and honoring what we figure out as we go along, [adjusting and tailoring to the needs and goals of our specific situations as we operate in community]. 

'Transformative' includes transformative justice, which recognizes that oppressive systems are at the root of technological harms. It argues that acknowledging systemic oppression is essential to addressing those harms and shifting away from carceral logics and toward healing systems. Transformative justice seeks repair beyond punishment, focusing not only on remedying wrongs but more broadly on instituting infrastructures of care and reorienting the values embedded within technical objects and practices.[cite][^reparative] It is not just a question of what bias to remove from technology, but of what to build in its place.

>"From the design to the production to the deployment to the outcome, there is constantly bias built in. It's not just the biases of the people themselves; it’s the inherent bias within the system. There's so many points of influence that, quite frankly, our fight is not for cleaning up the data. Our fight is not for an unbiased algorithm, because we don't believe that even mathematically, there could be an unbiased algorithm for policing at all." [...] "The goal is always to be building power toward abolition of these programs, because you can’t reform them. There is no such thing as kinder, gentler racism, and these programs have to be dismantled." (Hamid Khan interviewed in @ryan-mosleyActivistDismantlingRacist2020) 

[^reparative]: Reparative and restorative processing are part of this work, but the terms 'reparative' and 'restorative' in relationship to justice movements and to LGBTQIA+ histories are fraught. Instead I find the broader sense of 'transformative' resonates for me with trans\*, intersectional, and inclusive approaches to identities and [politics][— as well as to this project, its participants, its influences, and its intentions]. 

<!-- "politics of creation, prefigurative politics" -->

Trans\*formative is an active, prefigurative[footnote] stance. It brings `programming` closer to its synonym `processing`, combining computational practices with emotional ones, digital with digestive. Trans\*formative processing refers both to processing units (CPUs, GPUs, NPUs) and also to processing personal, communal, and generational trauma. It means both works-in-progress and algorithmic processes. Ongoing processing not fixed programmed states. Let's inspect further...

[^prefigurative]: `Prefigurative` just means embodying our values, making it "a daily endeavor of creating the world we want." and "our actions create the world we want right now, we don’t have to wait for the revolution to start another, better world." [@bransonPracticalAnarchismGuide2022].

>>"Revolutionary movements require a teleological pool from which to draw. The imagination is that teleological pool: it not only creates liberatory drives; it sustains, justifies and legitimises them. It undoes entire epistemes and clears a space for us to create something new. Though this 'newness', or the demand for something else, can never fully be realised in the realm of the discursive, it exists in other registers: it can be felt, heard, touched, tasted. The structural limits of this world restrict our ability to articulate all that the imagination is capable of conceiving. Do not forget this." [@olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021]

#### Transformers

Transformers are a current type of machine learning architecture being employed to create large models like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.[^techterms] They are good at digesting large clumps of text, images, video — all interpreted as numbers — and reconstituting them. Transformers main parts are called encoders and decoders, and it's often said that even their designers don't know what exactly is going on in these hidden layers. We can discuss the specifics of that elsewhere (see Interstitial: Codes for Un/Knowing). I find it more interesting that the *transformers themselves* do not know what is going on in these hidden layers of the own architecture — despite all the anthropomorphizing of AI systems, with widespread use of terms like "learning" and "understanding." While they process and produce meaning (input and output), transformers are never "aware" of the meaning of the content they are processing along the way. They are just crunching numbers.

Transformers are the latest, but won't be the last, in a long string of systems that ask data subjects and data subjectees[^techterms] to submit to their "superior" logics. With every iteration on their forms, we repeat their hype but lose trace of their histories in "race science" and colonizing power that captures what it means to know and be known. [@browneDarkMattersSurveillance2015, @benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019, @joqueRevolutionaryMathematicsArtificial2022]

The paper that launched a thousand transformer models was called "Attention Is All You Need." Transformer language models incorporate text context through a mechanism called "self-attention" that examines a selection of word-units surrounding each word-unit they interpret. [@vaswaniAttentionAllYou2023] As they proceed, they use this interpretation to predict the next most likely word to appear in a sentence, based on the words that have commonly appeared near the last few words before. 

But we need more than self-attention. We need self-reflection and co-regulation. We need systems that, in their very architectures, celebrate difference - rather than erase it.  

<!-- each of these para could be expanded. in critAI-genAI paper? -->

[^techterms]: For more explanation of terms, see "A Critical Field Guide for Working with Machine Learning Datasets" and "Intersectional AI Toolkit."

#### Trans\*

To move from the "transformer" model architecture to trans\*formative tech (and from tech to technocraft) means to acknowledge the requisite entanglement of community building and [critical sociotechnical systems]. It means knowing the material we are transforming — by sharing in, speaking nearby, walking beside, being constituted and supported by, and supporting in turn.

This work is about trans\*formation through trans\*lation and trans\*disciplinarity[^transdis] and trans\*gression.[^hooksTransgress] It lays the groundwork to imagine trans\*formers otherwise, to imagine [emergent/co-existing technological systems] at a slant, on the bias rather than always-already biased. It calls for queerer systems (queer as a politics, as in fuck you, as in QueerOS, as in queer-enough).[@dogparkdissidentsQueerFuckYou, @keelingQueerOS2014] 

[^transdis]: Trans\*disciplinary includes multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary — across and combined and between — plus what emerges when those diffractions become more than the sum of their parts. [@visResearchPeopleWho2021]

[^hooksTransgress]: As in "teaching that enables transgressions – a movement against and beyond boundaries." [@hooksTeachingTransgressEducation1994]

>"queer as [in] being about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to invent, create and find a place to speak, and to thrive and to live"
>>—bell hooks

This approach to technological trans\*lation and trans\*formation has no prerequisites. We are already queer-enough, coder-enough, valued-enough to participate in continually becoming. We are "always-already programming."[@AlwaysalreadyprogrammingMd] (See "Coding.Care")

Trans\* can be inclusive, fluid, in motion, outside binary logics, self-identifying, evolving, emergent, embodied. *Trans\*formative TechnoCraft* imagines systems that can also have these qualities, that can trans\*cend the logics constructed by capitalist, militaristic, racist, ableist, misogynistic lineages. 

>"queerness is itself inherent within [the history of] computational logic, [...yet] there exists a structuring logic to computational systems that, while nearly totalizing, does not account for all forms of knowledge, and which excludes certain acts, behaviors, and modes of being." [@gabouryQueerHistoryComputing2013d]

(See also trans\*feminist and crip technosciences below)

Trans\* also finds queer reverberations in the transducers all around us that constitute and reinforce computational systems. A transducer (from Latin for `lead across`) converts physical signals into electrical signals, or vice versa. Trans\*ducers are intermediaries that allow the trans\*fer between analogue to digital. Every time information gets trans\*mitted from an environmental sensor to a digital device — sound waves into audio files, pressure into heart rate [XXX,example] — trans\*duction has occurred, and thus some kind of trans\*formation. (Note how many times trans\*-ness appears in sites of cybernetic knowing.) These reimaginings of information's forms are always interventions, informed by the device designers' decisions as well as both contemporary and historical approaches to computational knowing. The material conversions required to power the logics of computation (turning qualities into voltages into quantities) all pass through gates of trans\* thinking. 

#### \*

The `*` after `trans` longs for anything that follows; it opens up space for the layered and undefinable becoming, and as such can include anyone who wonders if they belong, who wonders what they contribute, who wonders what "this whole thing" is about (be it gender, sexuality, technology, whatever). 

Combined with trans, or at large, the asterisk is the interstitial. It is a footnote that defines our terms, and also it is the invitation to extend beyond any definition given. 

The asterisk is a perturbation, a pebble in the shoe. In the German language, the gendering of nouns and verbs is haphazardly addressed by an asterisk that breaks the word, introduces a glottal stop between its 'masculine' and 'feminine' formations. `Student` or `Studentin` becomes `Student*in`; `Bäcker` or `Bäckerin` becomes `Bäcker*in`. This brief interruption can be read as a faulty solution that maintains gender-as-binary, it's true. And also, this hesitation adds a frequent awkwardness that highlights how often conversation is about gender unnecessarily. It physically opens up a space (in the mouth) where gender is unknown/unstable/all. 

A French or English apostrophe may mark an omission of letters, but this elision also joins together, suturing up the distance it creates. The asterisk shares this tension here, as a clot that heals, an unspeakable but audible gasp. 

Like the apostrophe at the start of `'pataphysics`, which gestures to the absurdity from which it springs, the asterisk is the instigator and the multiplier, the pivot and the punctum and the portal.

It is not the data point, reduced to numerical expressivelessness. It is not the node in the network, defined by its links and relations, abstracted away. It's not a redaction which the asterisk marks, but the possibilities of unknown language underneath. Or the tension of knowing and not saying, as in the marking of sw*@\r words. [Again, queer as a politics, "queer as in fuck you."] 

The asterisk is risk (just a step), is star, is A-star pathfinding, [weak-star topologies [^infinite vector space],] ASCII joy, a wry smile, and a mark of possibility on a treasure map. 

[The mathematical asterisk (star) represents duality, mirrors mirroring each other: Points connect to make lines and lines cross to make points.[CITE Miller]] 

[^infinite vector space]: We'll come back to this and how it relates to infinite vector space and transformers and machine learning, so don't worry if you don't know. (I also asked ChatGPT to re-explain it to me like I know no math, and that helped.) And how is it that all this comes back to nearness and distance, and how similarity and difference are mapped onto nearness and distance. What about nearness and difference, similarity and distance, what about reversing the polarities? What about activation functions that put these on XY axes and tamper with the expectations/intuitions? 

Again, the \* emphasizes an unspoken interstitial — interjection, interruption, insertion, interpolation — this work happening in between and nearby, underneath and overhead and throughout. [Here's a brief interstitial...] In digital contexts this may be called [`lerp`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/lerp) or [`tween`](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/creating-frame-animations.html) or [`spline`]()[^splines] or smoothing. These methods of interpolation are methods of creating or locating nearbyness. To `interpolate` in math is to create new knowledge (datapoints) based on existing knowledge (datapoints), or to estimate values at a position based on values from a nearby position. 

But I always mix up the terms `interpolate` and `interpellate`. To `interpellate` is to interrupt or intercede (again like interstitial) or to summons, cite, call out. Shall I interpolate the distance between `interpolate` and `interpellate`? Frantz Fanon describes being called out as a racialized body and witnessing himself as another person's brutal interpretation.[^Fanon] Louis Althusser describes being hailed by a representative of the State apparatus and understanding it is himself who they mean.[^Althusser] Both these interpellations are about being seen, being seen and shamed and submitting to this seeing. These interpellations are also crossing a distance, creating a nearness. This distance is a street or sidewalk, and it is also the conceptual distance between how someone else understands us and how we wish to be known. 

Interpolation divides up distance, quantifies it, makes it possible to cross. Interpolation makes interpellation possible in computational regimes, because it helps map (define) an individual to the general, as laid out in classificatory schemas (created from collections of other interpellated individuals). Computationally, proximity helps us jump to conclusions about each other. 

*Do you know how many kinds of measurements of distance there are? How many dimensions and ways to fold them?* [Anna Munster antethsis of networks, emphasis on nodes vs relations] *and how many algorithms for pathfinding, optimizing our ways across these spaces we've created everything about space and time and how to make more and less of it*

Can we write a theory of nearbyness (near-bi-ness)? Not nearness as measure, not proximity and similarity scores, not K-means and K-nearest-neighbors. A working theory of a different kind, that treats `nearbyness` as a practice for `attending-to`, not `nearness` as a study for `assumption-making`. It announces through its enactment of nearbyness — what it places side-by-side, in conversation, in contact, in tecture, in tension — that, and how, and why its elements require each other and the more-than their contact or nearbyness creates. This is a trans\*disciplinary practice, as more than the sum of its combined fields or niches, and it is a trans\*[XXXsomethingelse][XXXpracticetoo].

##### Formative 

* **formative**: fundamental, foundational experiences. what shapes us

**Nearbyness**

This operation by nearbyness brings us to form and formative. The assembling logic here is of accretion and coalition – an *Arcades Project* of wandering, filing, putting like with like. It is a machine learning task, an un-machine un-learning task, to decide how information goes together or does not, to find patterns in a system. It is a very human activity. This project enacts the process through feeling. (Flusseur's writing is a cutting away, Benjamin's is a collector's fever dream.)

>"[Writing] has nothing to do with constructing. It is, on the contrary, a taking away, a de-structing. It is, both structurally and historically, closer to sculpture than to architecture. It is a gesture of making holes, of digging, of perforating. A penetrating gesture. To write is to in-scribe, to penetrate a surface,"

I dream of a form that can hold everything. A form that can reveal how each part is connected. No parts. Just connections. Network graphs don't do it for me. I dream of a platform where I can write and code and share and cite and annotate and highlight and collage and print and remix and machine-read. In my dream notes I have written "semantic web layer cake" and "Gollum?" Is this some monster platform, am I the only one who wants this? Usually I imagine the things I want already exist — because how complicated could they be? — and then I try to find some extant version and come up empty and frustrated how to even make my own.

init --> name --> get --> set 

Code forms, pattern templates, like initializing classes to instantiate objects in object-oriented programming. Indicate what prior schemas you'll pull from, what parts you'll write over. What qualities you'll predetermine, and what aspects will be qualities of the entire class, and what qualities will be specific to each object. What actions will they know how to do? How will you establish and retreive this information? There's a language for all this in "object-oriented" programming, which requires a different sense of relationality than "functional" programming.  


<!-- Foundations -->

What is formative shapes us. These are the foundations we can't see, the scaffolding of our thought, the infrastructures of our being. I am interested in the formative aspects of sociotechncial systems, produced in entangled loops of human networks, codified language, and rare earth.  

Each of these works asks: What are the foundational assumptions that go into the design and implementation of a dataset, a machine learning system, or programmers themselves? Of any technology or way of being? They tease out the metaphors applied and question what other metaphors make space for other forms.

<!-- Form Content Loops -->

Form in-forms content. The shape of the container decides what can fill it. If I know how to make forms, or even platforms, not only content to plug in, I am more free to work the two in iterative, ongoing relationships. This is how I knead the dough — form and content and form and content and form. 

In this way, the material I work with also in-forms what I make, through its insistence, resistence, grain, thread tension. It in-forms itself into content as I try to bring forth some kind of form. 

Computation requires information to take on its formation. Its orderly logic is a shape imposed by and a reflection of the world, both at once. It requires contortion to represent us. Sarah Sharma reminds us, as the Broken Machines who do not quite fit these regimes: "to represent is also to be filed away." [@sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020] To understand through computation is to reduce to logics of categorization.[@crawfordAtlasAIPower2021] This is why we must imagine new forms — and this is why it is so hard to imagine new forms.

Reminds us that disabled people are not minoritized users of technologies created by experts but instead are experts themselves at actively adapting technologies to their needs.

>"In contrast to dominant forms of knowing-making for disability, we invoke crip technoscience to describe politicized practices of noncompliant knowing-making: world-building and world-dismantling practices by and with disabled people and communities that respond to intersectional systems of power, privilege, and oppression by working within and around them." 
>"Disabled people design our own tools and environments, whether by using experiential knowledge to adapt tools for daily use or by engaging in professional design practices. Crip technoscience conjures long histories of daily adaption and tinkering with built environments."

- "centers disabled people as knowers and makers"
- sees "access as friction" beyond inclusion and into material experimentation and political action that highlights the frictions of inaccessible 
- "interdependence as political technology" to shift the goals of tech design away from independence and toward entanglement and kinship building
- disability justice

Louise Hickman's ethnographic work on the ethics of access foregrounds access workers' key role in the production of crip technoscientific knowledge. She examines the highly customized dictionaries developed by her own Communication Access Real-Time Translation operator working in academic spaces, in order to show how their captioning work for the d/Deaf and hard of hearing community is "both the practice of crip technoscience as well as its product." Hickman highlights the collaborative, embedded nature of the work and the crip technoscience emphasis on "knowledge-from-below." [@hickmanTranscriptionWorkPractices2019a]

<!-- indigenous research methods -->

Develop forms, formats, and methods "on the terms of" the communities they are meant to represent, with their goals, values, approaches leading the work. 

>"after four centuries of extractionist, settler-colonial linguistic practice, linguists and other outsiders must work with indigenous languages on the terms of the communities they belong to. This includes allowing those communities to set the parameters, limits, and terms of your work – and making sure your work can benefit these communities. It includes being a listener and a supporter, even in “your” research, to how indigenous communities wish to uphold and celebrate their languages, culture, and survival." [@bjorklundAmericanistLinguisticsEthics2023]

This can fundamentally reshape the forms and functions of research, artmaking, valuemaking — because it acknowledges the varied principles on which it is founded. For example, in Indigenous epistemologies, says Shawn Wilson, "The concepts or ideas are not as important as the relationships that went into forming them. Again, an Indigenous epistemology has systems of knowledge built upon relationships between things, rather than on the things themselves." [@wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008] Fundamentally understanding differently knowledge, objects, relationships to them, would necessarily reorient one's work and the forms it takes — in deeply formative ways. 

>"this form is really just the web of relationships that have taken on a familiar shape. Every individual thing that you see around you is really just a huge knot — a point where thousands and millions of relationships come together. These relationships come to you from the past, from the present and from your future. This is what surrounds us, and what forms us, our world, our cosmos and our reality. We could not be without being in relationship with everything that surrounds us and is within us. Our reality, our ontology is the relationships." [@wilsonResearchCeremonyIndigenous2008]

To see form (shape, object) as relation, connection, is to position it in time and place. It is also to take "form" from its noun form (shape, object) into its verb form (mold, press, begin to exist). Like all verbs, then, implies subjects — the entities enacting and impressing a form into being, responsible for it, caring for it. Relationships. [This negates object-oriented ontologies and object-oriented programs that want to encapsulate and abstract away objects' entanglements with the world.]


Interdependence has been my intuitive knowledge, the pain and pleasure and fascination of my existence. 
*interdependence is indigenous knowledge*
this is something i absorb intuitively and then find the citation for after, as much research happens. 

>>"reality is the relationship that one has with the truth. Thus an object or thing is not as important as one's relationship to it. [...] reality *is* relationships or sets of relationships." (Wilson 73)
>>"reality is not an object but a process of relationships and an Indigenous ontology is actually the equivalent of an Indigenous epistemology" (Wilson 73)
>>"An Indigenous paradigm comes from the foundational belief that knowledge is relational. Knowledge is shared with all of creation."

>>Indigenous Research Paradigm: "a research paradigm is made up of four entities: ontology,epistemology, axiology and methodology. But rather than thinking of them as four separate ideas or entities, try to think of them in a circle: The entire circle is an Indigenous research paradigm. Its entities are inseparable and blend from one into the next. The whole of the paradigm is greater than the sum of its parts.[...] what Indigenous research is. Relationality seems to sum p the whole Indigenous research paradigm to me. Just as the components of the paradigm are related, the components themselves all have to do with relationships. The ontology and epistemology are based upon a process of relationships that form a mutual reality. The axiology and methodology are based upon maintaining accountability to these relationships. [...] An Indigenous research paradigm is relational and maintains relational accountability."

>>"An Indigenous axiology is built upon the concept of relational accountability. [...] value judgments lose their meaning. What is more important and meaningful is fulfilling a role and obligations in the research relationship—that is, being accountable to your relations." (Wilson 77) "Respect, reciprocity, and responsibility are key features in any healthy relationship and must be included in any Indigenous methodology;" 
>>"What am I contributing or giving back to the relationship?Is the sharing, growth and learning that is taking place reciprocal?"

>>"We could not be without being in relationship with everything that surrounds us and is within us. Our reality, our ontology is the relationships." (Wilson 76)


Susan Leigh Star calls infrastructure a "fundamentally relational concept," but one that despite its embeddedness operates invisibly unless broken. She argues infrastructure marks membership in relational groups, as we "acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects," practices, and standards. @starEthnographyInfrastructure1999  



form: manifesto, toolkit, caldron, zine
>"the manifesto has given way to the tool kit. The manifesto form of often dogmatic proclamations has yielded to a more open-ended organization of practices. Radical tool kits in particular gather instruments and resources that serve as practical philosophies and modes of organizing in difficult circumstances. [...] tool kits can be shape-shifting genres that variously provide guidance for rerouting, or reinforcing, sociopolitical practices" (Gabrys 2019).
  
>"to refigure the terms that would signify a particular position in an identity politic as terms that indicate a practice, a method. Disability, queerness, open source — not as identities, or groups I belong to, but as modes of doing, of how I practice myself. Being an outsider means that the question of theory and practice — how practice is affected by theory, how theory is constructed by practice — becomes the most important one. Membership to particular groups and experiences is often predicated on the visual — whether someone “looks like” they belong or not — which means that my membership to most groups must rely on something else. My belonging has more to do with how I enact that group’s politic" (Hedva, "Belonging", 2018)

TERM: *Deep Interdisciplinary* is able to view these fundamental states as hybrid, not only different fields or concepts but the core ways of seeing/being/becoming. The approach of constantly shifting lenses and destabilizing and viewing as spectra. Ontologically interdisciplinary. (not ontology or being but becoming, process philosophy). Bakhtin’s heteroglossia ("another's speech in another's language, serving to express authorial intentions but in a refracted way" (1934). and polyphony But what are the larger interfaces & infrastructures that could enable hybrid language and switching across, that can facilitate expanded ways of thinking? 

Anna Munster suggests that the form of networks numbs us to their relationality — every network looks like every other and in trying to understand them through seeing them as networks, we lose sense of what's within. She suggests focusing less on `forms` and more on `forces`: "—the closures and openings of relations to one another. It is at this level of imperceptible flux—of things unforming and reforming relationally" [@munsterAesthesiaNetworksConjunctive2013]

Like Erin Manning's a spiral is "more duration than form" [@manningAlwaysMoreOne2013] "From habit to invention, from technique to improvisation, the form becomes a folding-through of time in the making." // "An occasion is less an object or a body than a node of relation expressing itself momentarily as this or that—an edging into object, a swerving into body. The how or the expressivity of this relational node is the occasion’s subjective form."

//
Thus, trans\*formative means 
* **trans*formative**: emergent, embedded, justice-oriented, ethical, community practices taking shape and making change. 


### Techno

* **techno**: hybrid, digital, systems-oriented, mr.wizard science, project-driven not damage-centered

Techno-solutionist... Techno-utopian... Techno-dystopian... 

Techno...music? Yes, always take dance breaks.

Techno means a plethora of prefix possibilities and digital-analog hybrids (think what "cyber-" was to the '90s). Also systems-oriented, bubbling science experiments, project-driven not damage-centered.

>"This possibility of creating directed, coordinated, and controlled sets of techniken that ensure a reliable link between the addressor and the addressee is the precondition of not only computing but also Althusserian interpellation. The technical conditions of various computational systems—analog, digital, or quantum thus turn out to be coterminous with the development of modern disciplinary states and their sociotechnicalities, and addressability emerges as a key shared operational logic." [@dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022]
>"This widespread technik of addressing underpins the whole landscape of computing and its imaginaries." Address means you are locatable in space, means you are reachable. [@dhaliwalAddressabilityWhatEven2022]

#### these may go in the Toolkit instead...

It goes beyond the very valid criticism AI takes that it is biased because its data are biased ("garbage in, garbage out"). If an algorithm is at its most simple a set of instructions, a procedure (from the Babylonean), it seems obvious that it would be embedded with the assumptions of those who wrote those instructions, about how to implement that procedure. That is, there are many ways to do any task, informed by minute choices at every step. As these scale, and we know that at computational level these scale exponentially, the impact of these choices magnify and magnify. These choices have been normalized, naturalized, and neutralized by the mythology of the black box--and compounded by the computational speeds that allow thousands of operations to run per second. 

To not think to train on a variety of faces, or to include an operation in the code to account for language differences, happens because there is not a variety of perspectives in the room when these very human decisions are being made before, during, and after the data is being collected, before, during, and after the code is being written and run. 

#### Key forms & foundational concepts of generative AI systems explained

- "Machine conditioning" not machine learning: "the fuzzy usage of ‘learning’ anthropomorphises a mathematical optimisation process" [@gaitelyriqueFrancisHungerUnHype2021] or "interpretation machines" [@lohmannInterpretationMachinesContradictions2020]
- Replace neural metaphors: "Neurons" in neural networks are pre-set nodes that determine the weights and probabilities of information, ie *they do math.* The "brain" structure is a metaphor, what are other metaphors?
- Activation & loss
- Simplistic non-understanding:
  - "Given the statistical distribution of words in the vast public corpus of (English) text, what words are most likely to follow the sequence [...]? (Murray Shanahan (2022), "Talking About Large Language Models" @shanahanTalkingLargeLanguage2023)
- Vectors & Tensors: When you're a computer, everything's a number
- Models & Transformers: Encoding, Decoding
  - ML systems both create and interpret the numerical representations of information. 
- Semi/Un/Supervised depends on human labeling (see crowdwork below)
  - Was labeled, pre-sorted data used to train it? (Supervised) 
  - Or was the data unstructured, like plain text? (Unsupervised)
  - Unsupervised learning means data are even more essential to the models' outputs
- Complexity here is about scale: The speed and quantity of calculations that computation enables, NOT the complexity of those calculations themselves.
- Binaries & Booleans
  - Similarity & Difference
    - Often seen technically as a measure of "distance"
    - But of what "dimension" (aspect) and measured (represented numerically) in what way?
    - cosign similarity between the vectors (a function of the angle between the 2, cosign "normalizes" for scale)
    - What of the varied social understandings of similarity & difference?
  - Spatializing metaphors
  - "Grenzprobleme"
    - "Border problems" (via Pedro Oliveira)
    - "Our research shows that the BAMF's language analysis software makes mistakes - just like the people who use it."
    - Categorization is always a question of in/out-side. Concepts are codified through the creation and reproduction of these boundaries.

#### Classification logics

- Pervasive capture, data colonialism: 
  - >"the audacious yet largely disguised corporate attempt to incorporate all of life, whether or not conceived by those doing it as “production,” into an expanded process for the generation of surplus value. The extraction of data from bodies, things, and systems create new possibilities for managing everything. This is the new and distinctive role of platforms and other environments of routine data extraction." (Nick Couldry & Ulises A. Mejias  [@couldryMakingDataColonialism2019])
- Garbage in, garbage out: 
  - Conscientious collection methods, values and questions 
  - Proprietary, missing, indecipherable data, practices and documentation
  - Labor:
    - "The data labelers employed by Sama on behalf of OpenAI were paid a take-home wage of between around $1.32 and $2 per hour" [@ExclusiveHourWorkers]
    - "ChatGPT and other generative models are not magic – they rely on massive supply chains of human labor and scraped data, much of which is unattributed and used without consent,” Andrew Strait
    - "Automation runs on the averaged microjudgments of whole detachments of underpaid humans, not some supersmart computer." [Steyerl (2022) @steyerlMeanImages2023]
- Unacknowledged curation: 
  - >"All of these attempts to harmonize and create general descriptive languages are founded on a universalizing logic that in its most utopian dimensions believes that these political and infrastructural differences that stand in the way of classification are accidental and can ultimately be overcome." [Justin Joque (2015) @joqueDataCreationMeaning2015]
- Data bodies, algorithmic race & gender, the problem of representation: 
  - “your algorithmic gender may well contradict your own identity, needs, and values. Google’s gender is a gender of profitable convenience” (John Cheney-Lippold, We Are Data @cheney-lippoldWeAreData2017)
  - whose data are (not) included:
    - “we need to interrogate not only the security of our data but  [...] What kinds of stories cannot be told [...] because individuals do not have access to [a boutique self-tracking device], the time to engage it fully, and/or do not have the security to reveal the details of their everyday experience without increasing their risk of domestic or state violence?” (Jacqueline Wernimont, Numbered Lives @wernimontNumberedLivesLife2018)
    - whose stories are these? "what subject position allows us to ethically occupy, flourish, and move in a world of pervasive data monitoring? (Natasha Dow Schull)
- Worldbuilding with data: 
  - “Database design, in that way, is 'an exercise in worldbuilding,' a normative process in which programmers are in a position to project their world views—a process that all too often reproduces the technology of race.” (Ruja Benjamin, Race After Technology @benjaminRaceTechnologyAbolitionist2019)
- Uncertainty reduced to certainty 
  - "[The algorithm] presents something as a singular optimal output, when it is actually generated through multiple and contingent relations. [...] I understand the spatial logic of algorithms to be an arrangement of propositions that significantly generates what matters in the world." (Louise Amoore, Cloud Ethics @amooreCloudEthicsAlgorithms2020)
  - >>"If uncertainty is the ability for the unknown to be accounted for by comporting to containment under the logics of algorithmic models, then what can unknowability offer instead? [...]["BLACKNESS as space of ethical absence," "the unknown as a subject"] Unknowability born from the figure of the flesh opens the space for ways of understanding the world that are otherwise discounted because of their inability to be neatly measured and accounted for. It is the place in which irresolution is allowed to reside." (Morrison 2021, 255) >>"flesh becomes an essential outlier from which to assess the limitations of sociotechnical fixes. Flesh is the poignant, unavoidable signifier and text upon which to read the history and reality of total expropriation of value from bodies and land." (255) >>"leaving open the unresolved space of coming to know something that is relational: taking into consideration the specific context of the speaker, the place from which they speak, the closeness they share, and the mode through which that speaking happens. To know in this context is not a territorial claim to be made, enclosed, and defended but an endured practice of proximity. To speak nearby is a gesture of knowing that requires engagement, perforating the hermetic encapsulation of totality." (253) *relational knowing* @morrisonFlesh2021

#### Tech is TechNO (Refusal, Tactical Media)``

Not accepting models as the world we want to live in: 
>"Machine learning and predictive models as they currently exist can also resist reduction, but only if we treat the gaps between their results and our realties as spaces for political action, not errors to be fixed. We need to treat these models as we do global climate change models. GCC models offer us the most probable future, given past actions, not so that we accept that future, but so we work to change it. Only global climate change deniers seek to fix the model, rather than the world." @chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021

>Nam June Paik's call to "make technology ridiculous." (*We Are in Open Circuits*)


Open source projects are often open in name only. Zhong argues that not only do they [large corporate entities proporting the term] often fail to offer substantive contributions to open-source communities, they misuse the term "open source" to get free labor. 

>"In the same way big oil brands itself with greenwashing for illusory environmental progressiveness, big tech extol their open source efforts to open-wash their capitalist, monopolistic, and destructive reality. Technological development is in dire need for a policy-first, documentation-first, ideology-first methodology, and AI must transform its focus on creating systems which understands and addresses the complexity of its environment, critically assesses its context, and produces meaning-rich results." (Elea Zhong 2023)

Machine unlearning ([ender 2023](https://www.enderverse.org/notes/unlearning.html)) points out that new field of machine unlearning, which springs up due to the problem (created by machine learning's indiscrimine data scraping problem) assumes access to the models it wants to alter, assumes a powerful role with agency in big tech. Instead, ender combines questions of machine unlearning with adversarial data poisoning to ask how one can remove data from a model without access to the initial model. 



Tactical media are works that resist, revise, reverse their materials to engage political [potentials]. In her "Manifesto of the Broken Machine," Sarah Sharma shows how we might work *with* perceptions of [women and others as] outliers and errors, in order to work *against* the systems that frame them as such: **"A feminism of the Broken Machine focuses on and uses the logic of the machines to highlight current power dynamics that are otherwise hard to pinpoint. The Broken Machine uncovers and incites new power moves."** @sharmaManifestoBrokenMachine2020

>As "an investment in a multiplicity of actions, practices, performances, and interventions," says Raley, "tactical media activities provide models of opposition rather than revolution and aim to undermine a system that, as de Certeau reminds us, 'itself remains intact.'" [@raleyTacticalMedia2009]
>"practices such as reverse engineering, hacktivism, [...] the digital hijack, [...] collaborative software, and open-access technology labs, ' tactical media' is a mutable category [...]. tactical media signifies the intervention and disruption ... disturbance.
>"Tactical media is performance for which a consumable product is not the primary endgame; it foregrounds the experimental over the physical." 

David Garcia and Geert Lovink describe tactical media as "An existential aesthetic. An aesthetic of Poaching, tricking, reading, speaking, strolling, shopping, desiring. Clever tricks, the hunter's cunning, maneuvers, polymorphic situations, joyful discoveries, poetic as well as warlike." [@garciaGarciaLovinkABC]

>"learning to inhabit the world in a better way [...] the role of artworks is no longer to form imaginary and utopian realities, but to actually be ways of living and models of action within the existing real" (Bourriaud in Raley Tactical Media)

>"the lesson I think we need to learn from tactical media practitioners more broadly is that critique and critical reflection are at their most powerful when they do not adopt a spectatorial position on the (putatively neutral) outside, when they do not merely sketch a surface, but rather penetrate the core of the system itself, intensifying identification so as to produce structural change." (Raley R. "Dataveillance and Countervailance in @gitelmanRawDataOxymoron2013)

#### No to capital and Yes to sharing

TechNO is also open-access, open-source — in their refusal to capitulate to capitalist regimes of encapsulation, privatization, knowledge-hoarding and gatekeeping. 

#### Tech is Techne

Tech begins with techne, begins with fiber, begins with the meshy matrix that sustains us. [@plantZerosOnes1998] Tech means any tool. It means not only clay tablets but language becoming discrete written letters instead of a chorus of breath. [@carsonErosBittersweetEssay2014]
It includes the histories of technology erased and rewritten by narratives of conquest and power [cite?]. It includes technologies of passing, of obfuscation, of survival. It includes [XXX]

Ursula M. Franklin sees technology as a practice, the way things are done, not only the tools with which they are done — a system that includes "far more than its individual material components. Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004] She argues this show its deep link with culture. 
>"technology defined as practice shows us the deep cultural link of technology." // holistic / prescriptive technologies. 

Thinking of coding as craft moves it back into the realm of holistic technologies, focused on the practitioner, rather than prescriptive ones, focused on production, effectiveness, scale, and management. Franklin says prescriptive technologies, while often  "exceedingly effective and efficient, [...] come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it.'" Meanwhile holistic technologies require muscle memory and instinct; they allow the practitioner to "draw on their own experience, each time applying it to a unique situation." [@franklinRealWorldTechnology2004]

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one’s expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices."

### Craft

Focusing on craft means noticing the material, iterative, handmade, tinkering, iterative, process-oriented, embodied practices of knowledge and production that technologies emerged from, and how these practices can intervene in or reshape technologies, too.

>"As sewing is a technique of making that has been used primarily by women throughout history, and continues to be primarily the task of women in sweatshops in the global South, my proposal of the stitch as a material and conceptual operation can be seen as feminist, a way of generating new concepts by learning from people who have been subject to material inequalities because of their gender, their race, and their geographic location. The stitch can be thought of as the basis for a theory of feminist making, which values the forms of knowledge practiced daily by oppressed people as they make their lives in the face of violence. This places the stitch in the repertoire of strategies including the methodology of the oppressed, as described by Chela Sandoval, and the science of the oppressed, as proposed by Monique Wittig and elaborated by the art collectives *particle group* and the Electronic Disturbance Theater (with which I collaborate). 16  The operation of creating relations through the stitch, of finding means to connect groups of people who had been separated, can be seen as an abstraction of the work of women of color feminism, which sought to bring together women across racial lines. The stitch can be a way of imagining the community building necessary to create community-based responses to violence" @cardenasTransColorPoetics2016

#### Process oriented approaches

What uncomfortable affects/emotions emerge when we are brought into process? When the veil falls away that divided the maker from the audience? What do process-oriented modes reveal that we don't want to see? Neoliberal disgust with imperfection. The labor being asked of us, the labor we place upon ourselves. 

* I'm not sure who the we I use is, already collective data? Already acknowledging myself is diffuse? not sure who i'm writing from or what unstable gender, self I am.

* kinship & levels of access (self, editor, family, ally, neighbor, comrade, citizen, stranger)

#### Hand scale, accessibility

Craft does not scale, but can be used in resistance to scale. Using handmade, hand labor is one very important tactic still available to tackle the seemingly insurmountable scale of giant datasets we are living under the regime of now. 

The anarchist's toolchest, simple tools known well. 

AI and knitting: Simple gestures repeated into habit, into complexity.

Craft suggests repair, and error, and air. 

#### A craft approach also organizes labor and relations differently. 

>"The alignment of craft and craftiness is perhaps the best location to find a unifying thread that runs throughout the diverse technical and ethical worlds of hacking. [...] all hackers fit the bill as quintessential “craftspeople,” [...] Even if craftspeople tend to work in solitude, crafting is by definition a collectivist pursuit based on shared rules of engagement and standards for quality." 
>>"Intellectual guile" (outside the box)
>>"Craftiness, then, can be seen as thinking outside the box, or circumvention of inherent technological limitations in pursuit of craft. But we can also understand craftiness as exceeding mere instrumentality."
Coleman aligns hackers with crafts guilds. Requires "intellectual guile"
>[@colemanHackers2016]

>"Resistance to the Current: The Dialectics of Hacking"  @soderbergResistanceCurrentDialectics2022

**TechnoCraft** honors historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft — which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community — and aligns them with the aspects of technology which get overlooked: namely, the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the global majority.

#### Counter histories

[Black Gooey Universe]

>Core rope memory [From the Sasha](https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/from-the-sasha-into-the-zamani-death-as-a-moment-of-radical-continuity/) "During the pioneering of the Apollo spacecraft mission, women workers manually wove memory into computer systems, translating software programmed by MIT engineers into physical binaries. The first woman to do this was Hilda G. Carpenter, a Black lab technician who advanced the methods that would ultimately be used to land Apollo missions on the moon. These threading techniques, referred to as “core rope memory” and “magnetic core memory,” were laborious processes of physically coding information into machines using ferrite rings and copper wire to control the flow of electricity"

>"Weaving was already multimedia: singing, chanting, telling stories, dancing, and playing games as they work, spinsters, weavers, and needleworkers were literally networkers as well." (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 65)

>"they process and store data. Because there is no difference between the process of weaving and the woven design, cloths persist as records of the processes which fed into their production: how many women worked on them, the techniques they used, the skills they employed. The visible pattern is integral to the process which produced it; the program and the pattern are continuous. (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 66)

>"weaving wends its way through even the media which supplant it. While paper has lost its associations with the woven fabrics with which it began, there are .remnants of weaving in all writing: yarns continue to be spun, texts are still abbreviated textiles, and even grammarglamor-and spelling retain an occult connectivity. Silkscreens, printing presses, stencils, photographic processes, and typewriters: by the end of the nineteenth century images, texts, and patterns of all kinds were being processed by machines which still used matrices as means to their ends," (@plantZerosOnes1998, p. 69)

#### What craft allows

>"The materiality of yarn and AI are vastly different, despite making them work adjacent to each other. Adjacency may offer lessons for understanding the possibilities and limitations of AI systems, especially when the outcomes deviate from one's expectations of what the system can or will do. [...] Rather than aiming for generalization, adjacency is better understood as a mode of creativity for seeking unfamiliar and unexpected insights into AI systems and to enhance confidence in the maker/crafter in reformatting the AI system in ways that widen and deepen their collaborative capabilities. In other words, adjacent practices with AI signifies the potential to transform AI from a mere tool to a hybrid material for artificial everyday creativity practices." (Anuradha Reddy, Digital Creativity, 2022 "The Internet of Towels (2022) @reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022)
>"hybridizing or taking apart AI systems through material translations and free associations [...] these artefacts do not carry out the work of reconstructing or stitching back together what has been taken apart or hybridized by artificial everyday creativity" [@reddyArtificialEverydayCreativity2022]

#### Craft means taking care and care-taking

- Queer zine and newsletter networks
>"lesbian-feminist information infrastructures are built and sustained through networks that facilitate collaboration and resource-sharing amid precarious conditions."
[@mckinneyInformationActivismQueer2020]

- Feminist server art

>"The point is not only to expose or reveal invisible labours of care, but also to generate care. [...] In the perspective proposed here, generating care means counting in participants and issues who have not managed or are not likely to succeed in articulating their concerns, or whose modes of articulation indicate a politics that is ‘imperceptible’ within prevalent ways of understanding."
>>[@delabellacasaMattersCareTechnoscience2011]

>"All kinds of infrastructures involve service, maintenance, and care labor, [...and] their study can more precisely be understood as a concern of *feminist* aesthetics in particular." —Ines Kleesattel, Situated Aesthetics for Relational Critique: On Messy Entanglements from Maintenance Art to Feminist Server Art in [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]

Sustaining feminst servers takes "years of intense collective learning" (Kleesattel [@sollfrankAestheticsCommons2021]). "Tensions, ambivalences and immanent differences are uncomfortable and messy—and precisely therefore crucial for [...] Feminist Server Art," says Kleesattel. It holds "interrelated dimensions of actual hardware and software, common infrastructures, limited resources, care- and service labors, more-than-human poetics and speculative fabulations."

[transcript](https://pad.vvvvvvaria.org/ATNOFS-radio-broadcast-spideralex-danae-tapia):

   >"the tyranny of structurelessness, for instance. The difference between the people that developed the code, and the people that create the links and the interface with the inhabitants, the users of those networks, we didn't call them users, but inhabitants, because we wanted them to be involved in the management of that infrastructure." (Spideralex)

   >>from an Introduction to Technological Sovereignty by [Margarita Padilla(https://sobtec.gitbooks.io/sobtec2/content/en/content/01preface.html)]:
   >>"So as with all other sovereignty, technological sovereignty is made in communities. Communities exist and they are everywhere. unceasingly creating and recreating themselves, shared flats, neighborhoods, friends, workmates, professional networks, extended families, communities are everywhere. As with any symbolic construction communities are not something you can see with your eyes. They are something you see with your mind and feel the bonds with your heart. For those of us fighting for technological sovereignty, communities are a tangible reality. They're there. We see them and we feel them and though technologies theories are, typically related to consumer, luxury goods and insulated individualism. This is only the vision presented by the industry and the market, a market that seeks to isolate and be Wilder consumer, all technologies developed in community, these communities can be more or less autonomous or more or less controlled by cooperation, the struggle for sovereignty is about these communities, nobody invents, builds, or codes alone, quite simply because the task is such that it would be impossible."

   >"any infrastructure you need to set up from scratch, it's slow, and then it becomes like, it goes faster, it accelerates at one stage, I don't know why, I guess that you need to build the structure, the infrastructure that is going to be sustaining everything. And when you are figuring how to build it, or what is the better ways when things are slower. [...] And when you build a project that is based on informal and volunteer work, to maintain an infrastructure, things are gonna be slow, because yeah, we are all feminists. So we are very busy. We are struggling in different fights that are sometimes death and life important. And of course, like being able to learn to administrate services or host contents, maybe is not always the first thing in our list."

   >"Of course, all the feminist hack labs, fab labs, bio labs, feminist radios, servers, and artificial intelligence, internet bots and protocols that are developed or think or theorize from a feminist perspective. All the work around restorative justice process, feminist science fiction and futurotopis, building feminist libraries and fanzines, developing documentation and memory tools. Contributing to the herstory, producing and maintaining self defense resource about digital, connected space but also physical security. Permacultural gardens. Other gardens. Lands. Spells. Rituals. These tools, techniques for lives, land defending, all these are important and is part of the feminist infrastructure we are interested in."

Thus, **TechnoCraft** is the combo of historically dismissed and feminized practices of craft—which emphasize process, duration, ongoingness, community—with the aspects of technology which get overlooked, like the contributions to the materiality of tech from Women of Color in the Global South, and move slow and fix things, capacities for repair and air and error and poesis in the techne. 


## def main(): What's Included

Each section of Trans\*formative TechnoCraft offers an enactment of this thinking from a different angle, combining to enact the ethics and tactics described above. Together these public-facing resources attempt to provide plainspoken translations of technical, aesthetic, and ethical concepts in approachable zine formats, in order to support both AI insiders and marginalized outsiders in understanding the urgency of the issues facing automated technologies and the necessity of each other’s skill sets in facing those issue. 

The research foundational to this artistic practice is a critical reflection on the technical aspects of natural language processing and dataset processing techniques that support the latest systems, while situating their cultural and material antecedents through lenses of power. 

### CRAFT: *Coding.Care*

* **care**: inter-relational, mutual aid, healing-centered, dyke ethics of community & nontraditional family, moving away from shame toward vulnerability, bell hooks' communities of care, embodied
* **coding**: language-based, institutional and social, performative, speech acts

In *Coding.Care* I detail five years of engaging [XXX]

>Code Collective is a distinctive community of practice and pedagogical space that welcomes and supports many kinds of learners. For almost five years, this diverse hack lab has hosted workshops and hybrid-format meetings, while growing and shifting to meet the needs of our community—from pandemic support to alumni programming. The Collective unites students who may have zero technical experience with those who have lots—and values their experiences equally, with the mantra: "We all have something to teach each other." Through the Collective’s intimidation-free, learner-led, process-oriented approach, it theorizes and models caring community building and innovative university lab space, plus non-academic community workshops that can create knowledge transfer across disciplinary and social strata of all kinds. 
*I have adapted this format to guest faculty roles and workshops at Ars Electronica, Transmediale, Mozilla Festival, Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts, and elsewhere.* 

*Coding.Care* offers alternatives through creative-critical coding, using care-driven, community-building practices. It focuses on Creative Code Collective, the student organization I founded in early 2019 for emerging media artists, activists, writers, makers, and not-yet-engineers to co-work, co-learn, and think critically with code in an inclusive, interdisciplinary space. I wanted to create the adaptable, encouraging community I had needed when I was first struggling to learn to program as a writer trying to make electronic literature. 

Here, we see creative-critical code as a holistic community practice. This guidebook looks at a variety of the strategies, platforms, and tools we have explored and developed. It discusses how practices in the Collective—including project-oriented skillbuilding, co-teaching/co-learning, and snacks (always snacks)—embody its <span class="purple">guiding values, such as "scrappy artistic strategies not perfect code" and "collaboration not competition."</span> It also discusses some snags and lessons learned from our efforts building the now 3+ years-old community, like how our practices evolved through the shift to online platforms during the pandemic and the subsequent shift to hybrid collaborations. It draws on existing methods from Critical Code Studies and Intersectional queer, feminist, anti-ableist, and anti-racist theory; and it makes connections to similar organizations like Creative Code Berlin, Varia, and p5.js. 

In terms of impact, the guide addresses the ways students report these values and practices have shaped them as emerging makers and thinkers. Personally, even beyond my experiences as facilitator, I have found this community to be the strongest influence on my work. <span class="purple">Creative Code Collective has become a joyful space for creative risk-taking that nourishes my own practice.</span>

In sum, Creative Code Collective positions itself within an <span class="purple">ethics of coding care</span>—grounded in shared embodied knowledge, embedded co-creation, and programming with and for community. It tenderly proclaims: "We all have something to teach each other." Coding is now an essential literacy, but this guidebook calls for reaching beyond the limited literacy offered by the STEM–paradigm that supposedly "anyone can join." Rather, Coding.Care reimagines technoculture as truly being for anyone—to understand, impact, and intervene in.

### * : *Interstitial Portals*

These essays are meant to be portals to other times and places where "the past is not lost, however, but rather a space of potential." @chunDiscriminatingDataCorrelation2021 Past-present-future are spaces to know our relationships with systems differently and intimately. @olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021 

>"the future is not in front of us, it is everywhere simultaneously: multidirectional, variant, spontaneous. We only have to *turn around*. Relational solidarities, even in their failure, reveal the plurality of the future-present, help us to see through the impasse, help temporarily eschew what is stagnant, help build and then prepare to shatter the many windows of the here and now." @olufemiExperimentsImaginingOtherwise2021 
>"The imagination is central to the cultural production of revolutionary movements; its primary role is to signal *what could be. What could be* is a lingistic stand-in for a set of political, social and cultural demands, strategic aims, revolutionary longings. As such, it resists singular definition."  

Michel de Montaigne called his essays 'trials' or 'attempts'. These interstitial essays are attempts (essay: to try). They are also trials in the sense of struggles, to get at the core of the thing by sneaking between its ribs. They glance against logical modes of academic critical analysis or direct writing [as the production of use or call to action [XXXword?]] to be the thing and interrogate the thing at once.  

>"to let this book be the crisis rather than about the crisis or crises, rather, a plurality of traumas and pains felt collectively and individually." @cerankowskiSutureTraumaTrans2021

>"constituting life through the act of writing—rather than as expressive (describing a life that exists prior to the act of writing about it)." @fournierAutotheoryFeministPractice2021

Interest is about associative power, and connection
>"Isabelle Stengers argues that "interesting" in science involves a similar binding of subjects to subjects. Noting that "interest" derives from interesse, "to be situated between," @ngaiOurAestheticCategories2015

### Permissive processing

My favorite pieces of writing all feel permissive. In the moment of reading, I feel alive with the thought, "it's allowed to write this way?" And then, "Who is allowed to write this way? Maybe only after certain requirements are met." I'm not sure I am, which is why I will try, in hope that my doing edges open a little more space for others and othered writing forms.

It is a kind of processing — the same information moved through the gut, through the body, rather than computational processing. 

>"In projects like Theory Boner, artists and writers and curators come together to configure critical theory as something that must be processed and transmuted through the body and is very physical and even sexual in its effects on us; like [Hazel] Meyer's No Theory No Cry, [these works] make space for a way of relating to theory that is embodied, affective, and more directly relevant to the lives of queer and gender-nonconforming feminist artists, activists, and students. @fournierAutotheoryFeministPractice2021

#### Bias cuts

In another take on "bias" (because bias cannot be "optimized" out of systems), these are bias cuts striking diagonally or diffractively across the warp and weft of the fabric of the other texts here. Cutting and sewing on the bias puts fabric in tension, making garments that take the shape of the bodies they surround. Bias cuts are ways of working with and against materials, acknowledging their limits and not resolving them to right angles. 

#### Analogue antecedents

We have always-already been living in, talking about, performing with the questions amplified by automated systems, classifiation, and datafication. These essays engage in dialogue with 20th century media artists with a wide range of practices  — from daily ritual and minimalism to queer feminist body art and performance, from video made in isolation to public intervention — and they read their works as analogue pre-responses to AI systems. Their works show the breadth of artistic possibilities for reconsidering our relationships with computational systems was already establishing itself in parallel to the development of those systems. They also help me reimagine how I encounter data and AI systems now.





### TECH: *The Intersectional AI Toolkit*

>The Toolkit gathers and synthesizes aspects of queer theory, Black feminism, transfeminisms, and decolonial perspectives that can contribute valuable lenses for machine learning’s most pressing problems. It celebrates work done by other intersectional researchers and artists working to address these issues in many fields. And it is one of the few resources to clarify, without math or jargon, the inner workings of AI and how they always operate as sociotechnical systems. As a digital platform, it creates a forum for others to expand upon the work; and through in-person and hybrid-online workshops, it invites a variety of communities to participate directly in the systems that impact them.

Why a toolkit, the pleasures and problems of toolkits, the anarchist's toolchest:

>"What's unique about such IFH/MSs [intersectional feminist hacker/makerspaces] is that they are designed specifically to meet the needs and interests of the communities they are by and for, thereby allowing for a truly revolutionary *reimagining* of a 'different concatenation of social forms, knowledge, and technology'. In so doing, IFH/MS members articulate a strategy of hacking not only software and hardware, but their own social reproduction within the cybersphere."

>The artworks find relatable approaches to the often unseen issues in AI systems. "No Knots, Only Loops" documented in time-lapse the process of crocheting a 625-square-foot labyrinth in order to express the impact of machine learning’s scale on human labor and human language. Both the crochet fiber and the labyrinth suggest new, more tangible metaphors for machine learning systems while helping audiences grapple with the unseen labor and scale they require. 

>My work makes explicit the necessary handcrafted labor still required to engage with impossibly scaled systems. 
>They have been diving into the dark side of language and tech, examining gendered hate on Reddit forums as early as 2015, pre-incel movements and pre-Trump. The chatbot "ladymouth" responded to hate speech on the Red Pill and responded with quotations from prominent feminist scholars. I collected responses to the bot and performed selections from this database in public as a poetic intervention into how digital text is embodied. 

>"Inner Voice Over" undermines the infallibility of natural language processing by finding connection and delight in its errors. The audio sculpture asks audiences to contribute compassionate phrases by speaking into a whisper dish rigged with a speech-to-text system. Their phrases are added to a database I built that will return compassionate phrases in kind using text-to-speech voice synthesis. By bending and breaking existing machine learning tools through creative–critical investigation, the work imagines alternative purposes for natural language processing that move it beyond economic imperatives and into the poetic and empathetic.

<!-- Broadly these have been called data subjects. For clarity, I distinguish between data subjects, whose information is captured in datasets that train machine learning models, and data subjectees, who are interpellated by and bear the impact of those models when implemented as part of AI systems. We are all the sovereign Data State's subjects, and we are all subject to its gaze as data subjectees.  -->

  - >"holds in suspicion the prestige the commons concept has attained in the US and theory-cosmopolitan context, often signifying an ontology that merely needs the world to create infrastructures to catch up to it. Although the commons claim sounds like an uncontestably positive aim, the concept in this context threatens to cover over the very complexity of social jockeying and interdependence it responds to by delivering a conﬁrming aﬀective surplus in advance of the lifeworld it’s also seeking. [...] the attachment to this concept is too often a way of talking about politics as the resolution of ambivalence and the vanquishing of the very contingency of nonsovereign standing that is at the heart of true equality, [...] 
  - >**"the commons concept is a powerful vehicle for troubling troubled times. [...] The better power of the commons is to point to a way to view what’s broken in sociality, the diﬃculty of convening a world conjointly, although it is inconvenient and hard, and to offer incitements to imagining a livable provisional life."**
  - >[...] The commons is an action concept that acknowledges a broken world and the survival ethics of a transformational infrastructure. This involves using the spaces of alterity within ambivalence."
  - >"The space between and the spaces among involve distances created by the disturbance of being close without being joined, and without mistaking the other’s ﬂesh for one’s own or any object world as identical to oneself. Nonsovereignty is not here the dissolution of a boundary. It’s the experience of aﬀect, of being receptive, in real time."
  - >"form is not only a wish for a refuge, a cushion: it is also social, an exposure, a mediation, and a launching pad in relation to which beings can ﬁnd each other to ﬁgure out how to live in a movement that takes energy from the term ‘‘movement’s’’ political resonance."
  - >"taking each other on and in but never collapsing the distance that allows for attention. To take something in is to be nonsovereign in relation to it, but that’s not equal to being destroyed by it."
